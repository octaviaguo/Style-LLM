Gracious England hath Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men; An older and a better soldier none That Christendom gives out.	shakespearean
Wait, countrymen.	modern
Sweet Prince, why speak not you?	shakespearean
Let them play it.	shakespearean
If you can think of a more awful title, I’ll call her that.	modern
Oh, Caesar!	modern
Yes, you poor ghost, as long as I have any power of memory in this distracted head.	modern
Thus goes everyone to the world but I, and I am sunburnt.	shakespearean
Let’s have more sex in the world, since Gloucester’s bastard son was kinder to him than my daughters, conceived in lawful wedlock, have been to me.	modern
Tis not needed yet.	shakespearean
And, being done, thus Wall away doth go.	shakespearean
Should I have answered Caius Cassius so?	shakespearean
Well, I think that even if it weren’t on record, the truth would be remembered from one generation to the next—all the way to Doomsday.	modern
Twice did he turn his back and purposed so, But kindness, nobler ever than revenge, And nature, stronger than his just occasion, Made him give battle to the lioness, Who quickly fell before him; in which hurtling, From miserable slumber I awaked.	shakespearean
As for Antony, I’m not interested in his requests.	modern
And as with age his body uglier grows, So his mind cankers.	shakespearean
But since he stands obdurate And that no lawful means can carry me Out of his envy’s reach, I do oppose My patience to his fury, and am armed To suffer with a quietness of spirit The very tyranny and rage of his.	shakespearean
I hear The strain of strutting chanticleer Cry “Cock-a-diddle-dow.” Where should this music be?	shakespearean
For it is written in the book of Numbers: “When the man dies, let the inheritance descend unto the daughter.” Gracious lord, claim what is yours.	modern
Come to think of it, I am feeling sleepy.	modern
This sword but shown to Caesar, with this tidings, Shall enter me with him.	shakespearean
You won’t kill me, will you?	modern
But mistress, know yourself.	modern
Do not think it so unwholesome.	shakespearean
I would have her learn, my fair cousin, how perfectly I love her, and that is good English.	shakespearean
Yes, it is.	modern
And buried, gentle Tyrrel?	shakespearean
The other half goes to the state.	modern
Why, at her father’s.	shakespearean
The arbitrament is like to be bloody.	shakespearean
I regret not observing him more closely before I told you to do that.	modern
My own house, good lady.	modern
I’ll never believe any of these old legends or fairy tales.	modern
You shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to do.	shakespearean
As great to me as late.	shakespearean
Do you want to hear what she says?	modern
Come, let us to the banquet.	shakespearean
Tomorrow dinner, then?	shakespearean
Emilia, go to the castle and tell Othello and Desdemona what happened.—Will you please go now?	modern
By next week, I’ll be able to pay you.	modern
Who’s blocking the way?	modern
Then you’re a better man than the king.	modern
According to an agreement, I should wear it myself.	modern
Where else should his eyes be, if not in his head?	modern
Sure we thank you.	shakespearean
Ill will never prompted anything well said.	modern
Fear nothing.	shakespearean
Goneril with a white beard?	shakespearean
Do it not with poison.	shakespearean
If she and I be pleased, what’s that to you?	shakespearean
To the jail with him!	shakespearean
You are welcome, sir, to Cyprus.	shakespearean
Marry, I would not do such a thing for a joint-ring, nor for measures of lawn, nor for gowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor any petty exhibition.	shakespearean
Thrice noble lord, let me entreat of you To pardon me yet for a night or two, Or if not so, until the sun be set.	shakespearean
Enough, I am engaged.	shakespearean
Ay, my good lord.	shakespearean
But there is never a fair woman has a true face.	shakespearean
Do thy duty, and have thy duty, for my master and mistress are almost frozen to death.	shakespearean
God bless me from a challenge!	shakespearean
The great emperor Caesar, dead and turned to clay, might plug up a hole to keep the wind away.	modern
Dost thou affect her, Claudio?	shakespearean
It’s unbelievable.	modern
You’ll live in luxury with Gremio.	modern
It is the rival of my love.	shakespearean
Would I were in an alehouse in London!	shakespearean
How ingenious to make horseshoes out of felt.	modern
I’m your evil spirit, Brutus.	modern
Who’s within?	shakespearean
Somebody knocks.	shakespearean
I cannot tell.	shakespearean
The poor thing, I really think she loves me.	modern
Don’t do it, sir.	modern
The rest of the dead are princes, barons, lords, knights, squires, and gentlemen of birth and rank.	modern
If thy greatness will Revenge it on him—for I know thou darest, But this thing dare not— That’s most certain.	shakespearean
We will have more of this tomorrow.	shakespearean
Gentlemen, I hope you are well.	modern
Welcome, traveler.	modern
What, sigh for the toothache?	shakespearean
Why didn’t I just adopt a beggar’s child left at my doorstep, whose shame and dishonor I could have denied, not being its true father?	modern
And discourse fustian with one’s own shadow?	shakespearean
But yesterday the word of Caesar might Have stood against the world.	shakespearean
You will lose this wager, my lord.	shakespearean
Oh, this is terrible!	modern
Why dost thou call him “knave”?	shakespearean
This story breaks my heart.	modern
If the Prince be too important, tell him there is measure in everything, and so dance out the answer.	shakespearean
That it would please you leave these sad designs To him that hath more cause to be a mourner, And presently repair to Crosby House, Where, after I have solemnly interred At Chertsey monast'ry this noble king And wet his grave with my repentant tears, I will with all expedient duty see you.	shakespearean
Rise, and lend thine ear.	shakespearean
Michael Cassio, Lieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello, Is come on shore.	shakespearean
There is, there is.	shakespearean
My noble father, I do perceive here a divided duty.	shakespearean
One of my fellows had the speed of him, Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more Than would make up his message.	shakespearean
I am but hurt.	shakespearean
No, my dearest love, I would not for the world.	shakespearean
We’ll hurry.	modern
The Dauphin longs for morning.	shakespearean
Mark, King of Scotland, mark: No sooner justice had, with valor armed, Compelled these skipping kerns to trust their heels, But the Norweyan lord, surveying vantage, With furbished arms and new supplies of men, Began a fresh assault.	shakespearean
Who takes care of them?	modern
Moblèd queen” is good.	shakespearean
Leave me, I pray, a little.	shakespearean
The day is spent.	shakespearean
To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing?	shakespearean
So God sa' me, ’tis shame to stand still.	shakespearean
Poisoned, then.	shakespearean
Oh, help, ho!	shakespearean
Don’t take Helena’s side.	modern
I have been your tenant and your father’s tenant these fourscore years.	shakespearean
Look, I have a weapon, the best sword a soldier could have.	modern
Cassio’s a proper man.	shakespearean
Hero itself can blot out Hero’s virtue.	shakespearean
And so—?	modern
But near him thy angel Becomes afeard, as being o’erpowered.	shakespearean
Ah, my good lord, what have I seen tonight!	shakespearean
Then yield thee, coward, And live to be the show and gaze o' th' time.	shakespearean
I was a gentleman, And then I told you true.	shakespearean
Up, up, and see The great doom’s image!	shakespearean
What on earth does that mean?	modern
She lied to me, and she may lie to you.	modern
You’re a villain!	modern
A good direction, warlike sovereign.	shakespearean
At thy request, monster, I will do reason, any reason.— Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.	shakespearean
If any be Trinculo’s legs, these are they.	shakespearean
This Lodovico is a proper man.	shakespearean
If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a more delicate way than drowning.	shakespearean
It’s like a cannon.	modern
Oh, has it come to this?	modern
Iago, give these letters to the ship’s captain who brought me here, and ask him to pay my respects to the Senate of Venice.	modern
By Jesus, I think they will blow up everything if we don’t improve our tactics.	modern
The tawny cat has meowed three times.	modern
Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.	shakespearean
Lord, may I never see a day of trouble until the day I let someone treat me like that.	modern
Now all the young men of England are inspired and have stored their party clothes in the closet.	modern
It’s a horrible thing to die when you’re not prepared for it, my gracious lord.	modern
How yet resolves the governor of the town?	shakespearean
But, by 'r Lady, he must build churches then, or else shall he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose epitaph is “For, oh, for, oh, the hobby-horse is forgot.”      What means this, my lord?	shakespearean
And you, go call my fool.	modern
And as for my soul, how can the ghost endanger that, since it’s as immortal as the ghost is?	modern
Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle of hay.	shakespearean
Now he’ll work himself up to a fury.	modern
I’ve done everything you accuse me of—and more, much more.	modern
So please, my sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be happy.	modern
Wrong, evil traitor.	modern
Of us must Pompey presently be sought, Or else he seeks out us.	shakespearean
I hope all reports about me simply tell the truth, no more or less.	modern
If it’s possible to do this without putting yourself in danger, dear Captain Blunt, say goodnight to him from me and give him this important note.	modern
A goodly one, in which there are many confines, wards, and dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.	shakespearean
Hold, worthy lady, hold!	shakespearean
Tis most true, And he beseeched me to entreat your Majesties To hear and see the matter.	shakespearean
I hope for my brother’s sake that he just wrote it to test my honor.	modern
Good morning to all these lovely people.	modern
Are you good men and true?	shakespearean
Tonight we’ll wander through the streets and observe the people.	modern
But those that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads.	shakespearean
Perform the speech just as I taught you, musically and smoothly.	modern
Time to buy myself a mirror and employ a few dozen tailors to dress me up in the current fashions.	modern
Why should he not?	shakespearean
What do you say?	modern
I’m afraid it will  I’d love it.	modern
O sir, pardon me!	shakespearean
Take me to Antony.	modern
You should look like an innocent flower, but be like the snake that hides underneath the flower.	modern
Not yet, my cousin.	shakespearean
Let’s go.	modern
Now in the factory of thought, create the image of all London pouring forth into the streets.	modern
Most sincerely.	shakespearean
And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?	shakespearean
O thou invisible spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be known by, let us call thee devil!	shakespearean
Caesar, I’m telling you that Antony is dead.	modern
This castle hath a pleasant seat.	shakespearean
Caesar wrote for him to come to Rome.	modern

He is the brooch indeed And gem of all the nation.	shakespearean
Yes, it’s true, sir.	modern
followed you on your sad wanderings, ever since your bad luck began.	modern
Conceit upon her father.	shakespearean
I know not, gentlemen, what you intend, Who else must be let blood, who else is rank.	shakespearean
He is in love with Hero.	modern
My situation is desperate.	modern
He thinks “G” is me.	modern
Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?	shakespearean
Draw, you rogue, or I’ll so carbonado your shanks.	shakespearean
No, it heals gradually.	modern
Come, go we to the king.	shakespearean
Thy garments are not spotted with our blood, Nor thou within the compass of my curse.	shakespearean
Ay, madam, twenty several messengers.	shakespearean
He speaks home, madam.	shakespearean
Yet at the first I saw the treasons planted.	shakespearean
Don’t you know he has?	modern
Welcome back!	modern
Either the lovers have different social standings—	modern
Well, no, not literally.	modern
No, my dear cousin.	modern
Urchins Shall, forth at vast of night that they may work, All exercise on thee.	shakespearean
We should definitely say something to the Moor.	modern
Why, to keep the eyes on the sides, so that you can see anything that you can’t sniff out.	modern
We heard it very clearly.	modern
Had you not come upon your cue, my lord, William Lord Hastings had pronounced your part— I mean your voice for crowning of the king.	shakespearean
No, it was just a dream.	modern
That’s just what I thought.	modern
Is this a holiday?	shakespearean
I don’t think he wants to be disturbed.	modern
By God, I will tell the king about these taunts.	modern
Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?	shakespearean
Good morning, General.	modern
Follow me, madam.—Throw the blind traitor outside.	modern
Tis very strange.	shakespearean
Prithee, nuncle, be contented.	shakespearean
No, by this heavenly light!	shakespearean
Phoebe, keep your promise to marry me, and to marry this shepherd if you choose to refuse me.	modern
He really plays well.	modern
I’m happy about that.	modern
One doth not know How much an ill word may empoison liking.	shakespearean
I shall obey you.	shakespearean
Therefore, when he sees reason of fears as we do, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same relish as ours are.	shakespearean
If he do fear God, he must necessarily keep peace.	shakespearean
I can’t say no.	modern
Yes, or to wear cosmetics?	modern
If you work for him, you’re a fool and should wear a fool’s cap.—So how’s it going, uncle?	modern
Nobody delivered it, my lord.	modern
I hope this play is well cast now.	modern
My noble girls!	shakespearean
Good madam, be patient.	modern
Up with my tent!—Here will I lie tonight.	shakespearean
And they’ve been plotting things together.	modern
But why should my reputation for honor last longer than my honor did?	modern
Yield, cur.	shakespearean
A  What’s going on?	modern
Thy spirits are most tall.	shakespearean
I’m that great gust to her fire.	modern
I’ve relinquished my authority, so please—I’ll see you all before long.	modern
I once more take my leave.	shakespearean
Our brother is imprisoned by your means, Myself disgraced, and the nobility Held in contempt, while great promotions Are daily given to ennoble those That scarce some two days since were worth a noble.	shakespearean
My lord is so heavy!	modern
She could even what?	modern
The first time we see the world as newborns, we cry and scream.	modern
crowned by the golden sun, observed his heroic son and smiled to see him mangle the work of nature, French youth whose fathers and God had nurtured for twenty years, since they were babies.	modern
Let him bless thee too.	shakespearean
Our army shall somberly attend this funeral and then depart for Rome.	modern
Please, who?	modern
So go on, tell me the news.	modern
We speak no treason, man.	shakespearean
Good my lord— You have been a boggler ever.	shakespearean
Early in the morning I’ll go visit Desdemona and plead my case.	modern
I can tell you who time strolls for, who it trots for, who it gallops for, and who it stops cold for.	modern
I think we’ll have to leave out all the killing, come to think of it.	modern
Or is the adder better than the eel Because his painted skin contents the eye?	shakespearean
No, none that you’re smart enough to make.	modern
My own safety is the only important thing now.	modern
I’ll to the throng.	shakespearean
Within this half hour will he be asleep.	shakespearean
A night isn’t much time for addressing matters of this importance.	modern
Where’s the king?	modern
All thy tediousness on me, ah?	shakespearean
I pity your situation.	modern
But Miranda is so much more beautiful, you can’t even compare the two.	modern
Indeed, it is a strange-disposèd time.	shakespearean
Pray, sir, be patient.	shakespearean
Ay, my lord.	shakespearean
Why then, you are in love.	shakespearean
Here therefore for a while I will remain.	shakespearean
I pray you, hear her speak.	shakespearean
I myself am the King of Naples, since I saw with my own eyes—these eyes that haven’t been dry since—my father killed in a shipwreck.	modern
Then must we look from his age to receive not alone the imperfections of long-engrafted condition, but therewithal the unruly waywardness that infirm and choleric years bring with them.	shakespearean
He therefore sends you, meeter for your spirit, This tun of treasure, and, in lieu of this, Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim Hear no more of you.	shakespearean
Well roared, Lion!	shakespearean
Until Birnam Wood gets up and moves to Dunsinane, I won’t be affected by fear.	modern
This fellow doth not stand upon points.	shakespearean
Now, if courtiers were shepherds, that kind of courtesy would be unclean.	modern
It is a letter from my brother that I have not all o'er-read.	shakespearean
I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.	shakespearean
Good morning, Caesar.	modern
I make all use of it, for I use it only.	shakespearean
Come at me in the form of a rugged Russian bear, an armor-plated rhinoceros, or a tiger from Iran.	modern
But listen to me; let me guide you.	modern
As I was working on one musty room, the Prince and Claudio entered.	modern
I am right loath to go.	shakespearean
Your true demonic features are distorting your body.	modern
This is going even better than I planned.	modern
Then ’tis most like The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth.	shakespearean
I’ll move to a more open place and there speak to great Caesar as he walks past.	modern
Nor you, as we are, loyal.	shakespearean
Are these spirits we see before us?	modern
In a minute, sir.	modern
Oh, now forever Farewell the tranquil mind!	shakespearean
Went he hence now?	shakespearean
Stay with us tonight.	modern
This letter is for you from Signor Antonio.	modern
Sir, I lack advancement.	shakespearean
For my uncle is King of Denmark, and those that would make mouths at him while my father lived give twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little.	shakespearean
The rapier and the dagger.	modern
Maybe we can benefit from the same chaos that has defeated us.	modern
I will not sup tonight.	shakespearean
They all do hate him As rootedly as I.	shakespearean
I’ll take my leave.	shakespearean
From both, my lord.	shakespearean
Michael, good night.	shakespearean
Who comes with him?	modern
What warlike noise is this?	shakespearean
I say I love thee more than he can do.	shakespearean
Indeed, sweet love, I was coming to your house.	shakespearean
Come on, let’s go to prison.	modern
Watch Titinius and tell me what you see in the field.	modern
Go immediately, and do exactly as I wrote down.	modern
Over there, where Titinius mourns it.	modern
A single thing, as I am now, that wonders To hear thee speak of Naples.	shakespearean
The one of them contains my picture, Prince.	shakespearean
Yes, my lord.	modern
But he would feel even better if I could tell him that you had left Antony and put yourself under his protection.	modern
Can’t what, my lord?	modern
Ah, ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!	shakespearean
I feel sicker and sicker.	modern
Seek him, bid him come hither.	shakespearean
Ah, dear Nature, my goddess, listen to me!	modern
My countryman, but yet I know him not.	shakespearean
So you walk softly, and look sweetly, and say nothing, I am yours for the walk, and especially when I walk away.	shakespearean
Well, well, let’s go.	modern
Nice save!	modern
Look: Benedick is so pale—are you sick, or angry?	modern
But, alas the while!	shakespearean
Truly, a peck of provender.	shakespearean
I’m not a doddering old fool who brags about the things he did when he was young, and what he would do now if he weren’t so old.	modern
That’s it—I’m done.	modern
There is no other shelter hereabouts.	shakespearean
If our sport had gone forward, we had all been made men.	shakespearean
Let’s do that.	modern
Then would to Heaven that I had never seen ’t!	shakespearean
I wonder why Cambio hasn’t shown up in all this time.	modern
Comes his army on?	shakespearean
Or, failing so, yet that I put the Moor At least into a jealousy so strong That judgment cannot cure.	shakespearean
Good morning to you, friend.	modern
Your face, my thane, is as a book where men May read strange matters.	shakespearean
At your choice, sir.	shakespearean
I’d kiss you before I spoke.	modern
It’s stopped now—it must be played for some local god of the island.	modern
Tis spoken well.	shakespearean
My lord, you once did love me.	shakespearean
I have a list of all the important men.	modern
Very well, my supreme lord—that’s what I have to call you now.	modern
If he’s so sad and solemn when he’s young, I can only imagine how much he’ll cry as an old man.	modern
Good day to you, sir.	modern
You’re the one I have to obey.	modern
Where is that damnèd villain, Tranio, That faced and braved me in this matter so?	shakespearean
Why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter?	shakespearean
man’s cheeks.	modern
Show him and make him grieve.	modern
He sleeps all day like a cat.	modern
In cunning I must draw my sword upon you.	shakespearean
Tie him to this chair.—You’ll see, criminal— By the gods, it’s disgraceful for you to pull my beard.	modern
Where should we meet?	modern
Away, then.	shakespearean
Do then, but I’ll not hear.	shakespearean
Yes, my good lord.	modern
Sir, don’t even try to beat me in a battle of wits.	modern
No, faith, hate him not, for my sake.	shakespearean
Confirmed, confirmed!	shakespearean
Therefore  You will not pay for the glasses you have burst?	shakespearean
Behold the ordnance on their carriages, With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur.	shakespearean
So, so, so.	shakespearean
Please, don’t make fun of me.	modern
I beg you not to do this, my lord.	modern
They’re ready whenever you are.	modern
All that glitters is not gold— You’ve often heard that said.	modern
I’ll just speak a word or two here in the house and then I’ll go with you.	modern
And since I wooed her in your name, I’ll join you in disgracing her.	modern
All that I will tell you is that the duke hath dined.	shakespearean
Good Mr. Mustardseed, I know you very well.	modern
Yes, sooth, and so do you.	shakespearean
Who do you obey here?	modern
Beware of March 15th.	modern
You can’t mean it, Tranio!	modern
Oh, devil, devil!	shakespearean
He’s changed a great deal.	modern
Good morrow, noble sir.	shakespearean
Please be careful.	modern
So-so” is good, very good, an excellent answer.	modern
I bet it’s a love letter!	modern
Oh, Cassius, I’ll run far from this country to where no Romans can find me.	modern
get his position and use him to hurt Othello at the same time?	modern
Take them in.	shakespearean
I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it being so proper.	shakespearean
Where have I been?	shakespearean
Come on, gentle my lord, Sleek o'er your rugged looks.	shakespearean
Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion be your tutor.	shakespearean
I doubt some foul play.	shakespearean
My lord, in Athens.	shakespearean
I cry you mercy, then, I took you for that cunning whore of Venice That married with Othello.—You, mistress, That have the office opposite to Saint Peter And keep the gate of hell!	shakespearean
Good sir, I do in friendship counsel you To leave this place.	shakespearean
My liege, here is a villain and a traitor, that, look your Grace, has struck the glove which your Majesty is take out of the helmet of Alençon.	shakespearean
Why is my lord enraged against his love?	shakespearean
He will die.	modern
What if a fellow were bringing him a couple of hundred pounds to toss around?	modern
How foolish do your fears seem now, Calphurnia!	shakespearean
What’s that, you runt?	modern
Sir, we’ll follow as soon as Mark Antony kisses Octavia good-bye.	modern
The earth has bubbles, just like the water, and these creatures must have come from a bubble in the earth.	modern
My mind was never yet more mercenary.	shakespearean
The king has just honored me, and I have earned the good opinion of all sorts of people.	modern
There’s magic in its fabric.	modern
Who’s there?	shakespearean
Abhorred villain!	shakespearean
Oh, withered is the garland of the war.	shakespearean
Rage, blow!	shakespearean
All but Metellus Cimber, and he’s gone To seek you at your house.	shakespearean
I will see them.	shakespearean
Le Roy?	shakespearean
How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport, That now on Pompey’s basis lies along No worthier than the dust!	shakespearean
He’s walking ahead of me, and he keeps daring me to follow him.	modern
Thou call’st on him that hates thee.	shakespearean
I am the king himself.	shakespearean
Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.	shakespearean
Well, enjoy the sweetness of deep sleep.	modern
The fire is ready.	modern
Natures of such deep trust we shall much need.	shakespearean
It is the lady that Pyramus must love.	shakespearean
He’s not very tall, but he’s tall enough for his age.	modern
What do you see?	shakespearean
There’s a feud between the two dukes.	modern
A southwest blow on ye And blister you all o'er!	shakespearean
Good repose the while!	shakespearean
Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.	shakespearean
You’re wrong to kill me for loving you.	modern
Bandage my wounds!	modern
This is beyond weird.	modern
Is there such a place?	modern
I am glad to see your Honor.	shakespearean
Hast thou slain him then?	shakespearean
I must be circumstanced.	shakespearean
Is that Barnardo?	modern
Please, tell me some of them.	modern
Thou hotly lust’st to use her in that kind  For which thou whipp’st her.	shakespearean
Speak plainly.	modern
I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of Henry, Lord Scroop of Masham.	shakespearean
Are you educated?	modern
Friends, go.	modern
Get to the point, since we already know the truth.	modern
It did always seem so to us.	shakespearean
So what’s going on?	modern
The whole world thought your father was an honorable man, but he was always my enemy.	modern
How do you, women?	shakespearean
Tarry a little.	shakespearean
What dost thou profess?	shakespearean
Oh, Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!	modern
Give me Bianca for my patrimony.	shakespearean
See what a rent the envious Casca made.	shakespearean
Right now; as fast as she can say the vows.	modern
When time shall serve, let but the herald cry, And I’ll appear again.	shakespearean
Both of which, master constable— You have.	modern
Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves?	shakespearean
Nay, indeed if you had your eyes, you might fail of the knowing me.	shakespearean
Be not so hasty to confound my meaning.	shakespearean
Didn’t you hear it?	modern
You are as well provided in both respects as any prince in the world.	modern
Watch out!	modern
Has anyone ever courted a woman in this state of mind?	modern
Have you not read, Roderigo, Of some such thing?	shakespearean
Give me your love instead, as I give you mine.	modern
Banquo, if your soul is going to make it to heaven, tonight’s the night.	modern
Therefore prepare you.	shakespearean
But to my mind, though I am native here And to the manner born, it is a custom More honored in the breach than the observance.	shakespearean
He’s his mother’s child from head to toe.	modern
Oh, out of that “no hope” What great hope have you!	shakespearean
Are you squinting at me?	modern
He’s bound unto Octavia.	shakespearean
I don’t know what you mean by that, but I’m sure Caesar fell down.	modern
So he’s dead?	modern
Oh, don’t worry about it—we’ll dip your    I’ll get you for that one.	modern
I’ll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle.	shakespearean
For Christian shame, put by this barbarous brawl.	shakespearean
Pile of dirt!	modern
He’s safe, Antony.	modern
The hand of death has taken him.	modern
I’ll buckler thee against a million.	shakespearean

With anger, with fever, or with hunger, sure, my friend, but never sick with love.	modern
Alas, why would you heap this care on me?	shakespearean
One cried, “God bless us!” and “Amen” the other, As they had seen me with these hangman’s hands.	shakespearean
If that’s true, it’s a serious fault, and Caesar has paid seriously for it.	modern
How old art thou?	shakespearean
Let those who would mar this fair land’s peace with treason die before they can enjoy its wealth.	modern
Get yourself to a	modern

Me neither.	modern
How is ’t?	shakespearean
Why are you leading these men through the streets?	modern

Stop, Demetrius!	modern
I’d wager twenty times as much on my wife.	modern
Soft, no haste.	shakespearean
Sure, I shall never marry like my sisters, To love my father all.	shakespearean

Not today, O Lord, Oh, not today, think not upon the fault My father made in compassing the crown.	shakespearean
It’s dangerous to talk about it.	modern
Fare thee well!	shakespearean

You’ll get some of what you want.	modern
Why, what you will.	shakespearean
My lord, I have some mementos of yours that I’ve been meaning to give back to you for a long time now.	modern
Do so, and after two days I will discharge thee.	shakespearean
If it be that— If it be that, or any that was hers, It speaks against her with the other proofs.	shakespearean
I’m sure it is to knight you, Captain.	modern
Well, don’t face off with me.	modern
To save her life, I’ll say she is not so.	shakespearean
Well, Catesby, ere a fortnight make me older I’ll send some packing that yet think not on ’t.	shakespearean

Then you must say “I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.” I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.	shakespearean
Pretty York, who told you about his teeth?	modern
Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.	shakespearean
Those that are in extremity of either are abominable fellows and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than drunkards.	shakespearean
I mean, my head upon your lap?	shakespearean
Oh, I’ve heard him talk about that brother, and he described him as the most inhumane man alive.	modern
Hortensio, have you told him all her faults?	shakespearean
God forbid!	modern
You’re going to pay for this, Roderigo.	modern
All right, my lord.—How’s the king doing?	modern
So I’m free.	modern
Follow her.	modern

Oh, what a fall it was, my countrymen!	modern
The sweet and bitter fool Will presently appear— The one in motley here, The other found out there.	shakespearean
Would he have stolen away From sleeping Hermia?	shakespearean
Repays he my deep service With such deep contempt?	shakespearean
The dearest ring in Venice will I give you, And find it out by proclamation.	shakespearean
Come, come, you’re drunk.	shakespearean
O Regan, wilt thou take her by the hand?	shakespearean
And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.	shakespearean
Why do you speak, too, “Why blame you me to love you?”?	shakespearean
If she be a traitor, Why so am I.	shakespearean
I recognize his walk.	modern
Is supper ready?	modern
The Moor hath killed my mistress!	shakespearean
Go to, go to.	shakespearean
I’ve never been more useful to you than I will be now.	modern
Repair thy wit, good youth, or it will fall To cureless ruin.	shakespearean
I pray you, pardon me.	shakespearean
There’s a division betwixt the dukes.	shakespearean
I’ll ask you another question.	modern
Leave you!	shakespearean
Is it possible?	modern
Sir, amen.	shakespearean
What an enormous thing for us to forget!—Edmund, tell us, where’s the king?	modern
Yes, I truly think He did great good.	modern
Called you, my lord?	shakespearean
Is that possible?	modern
I’m hoping for better.	modern
We shouldn’t displease him.	modern
But, in loving me, you should love the friend of France, for I love France so well that I will not part with a village of it.	shakespearean
Went they not quickly, I should die with laughing.	shakespearean
There’s a similar mark on her arm.	modern
No, who are  Long live the king!	modern
I’m waiting here for the general, and I don’t want him to see me with a woman.	modern
Well then, confess and live.	shakespearean
Count how many times the clock chimes.	modern
The lieutenant has to get to heaven before the ensign.	modern
What’s that supposed to mean?	modern
Welcome back to Denmark, my lord.	modern
But you’re too good a friend for me to wish her on you.	modern
Sir, my king, don’t waste your time mulling over how strange this business is.	modern
Fellow, come from the throng.	shakespearean
Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow?	shakespearean
Over your wounds—which, like speechless mouths, open their red lips, as though to beg me to speak—I predict that a curse will fall upon the bodies of men.	modern
Tut, tut, you’ve become rather icy.	modern
No more be done.	shakespearean
No, I won’t take a husband until they make men out of something other than dirt.	modern
Your wife Octavia, with her self-effacing eyes and self-righteous assumptions, won’t get any praise from patronizing me.	modern
Swear by my sword.	modern
He’s at the duke’s morning and night, accusing the state of harming free trade if they deny him justice.	modern
O, help him, you sweet heavens!	shakespearean
Play the kind of music that puts people to sleep.	modern
I urged you further, then you scratched your head And too impatiently stamped with your foot.	shakespearean
Even if you were as handsome as  I beg your highness’ pardon.	modern
Tell me the truth.	modern
Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires.	shakespearean
If that’s the case, tears wash my eyes more than hers.	modern
Be gentle to her.	shakespearean
Next month with us.	shakespearean
Come forth.	shakespearean
For three months, hmmm.	modern
How shall we then behold their natural tears?	shakespearean
Now come sing around the cauldron like a ring of elves and fairies, enchanting everything you put in.	modern
Shake my hand.	modern
Yes, a dozen, and as many to th' vantage as would store the world they played for.	shakespearean
Now, you tanned fieldworkers who are so tired of August’s labors, get out of the dirt and come rejoice with us here.	modern
How can I help you, sir?	modern
Even now, now, very now, an old black ram Is tupping your white ewe.	shakespearean
O hated potion, hence!	shakespearean
I did that to him.	modern
Yes, he will, and the queen as well.	modern

If this be known, Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back, For I will slay myself.	shakespearean
Can you imagine cement and stone talking better?	modern
The pound of flesh which I demand of him Is dearly bought.	shakespearean
The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace.	shakespearean
Help me hence, ho!	shakespearean
Listen to you, instructing me like a parrot would.	modern
Had I as many sons as I have hairs, I would not wish them to a fairer death.	shakespearean
We don’t intend any harm to you, nor to anyone else.	modern
Hortensio, peace.	shakespearean
Perform ’t, or else we damn thee.”                                                                     How, my love?	shakespearean
Tell her the king, that may command, entreats— That, at her hands, which the king’s King forbids.	shakespearean

That way, the maiden that stood between me and them shall be the means of my achieving my desire.	modern
Good Prince, say something!	modern
Help, dear lord, or the battle will be lost!	modern
Fear not, my lord.	shakespearean
How is ’t, brother!	shakespearean
But maybe you don’t like mine, or his, or hers either.	modern

Don’t I deserve more than this?	modern
Be valiant, and speed well.	shakespearean
Have you a soul or sense?	shakespearean
Thy adversary’s wife doth pray for thee.	shakespearean
May you choke on any other sentiments like that!	modern
They swore that you were almost sick for me.	shakespearean
Here’s some more news coming in.	modern

Nor none that live, I hope.	shakespearean
Why do you say that?	modern
My good lords, I plan to.	modern
They must lie there.	shakespearean
What an ass I am.	modern
The king his master needs must take it ill, That he, so slightly valued in his messenger, Should have him thus restrained.	shakespearean

Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine Worth seizure, do we seize into our hands Till thou canst quit thee by thy brother’s mouth Of what we think against thee.	shakespearean
Who hath he left behind him general?	shakespearean
Then go we in to know his embassy, Which I could with a ready guess declare Before the Frenchman speak a word of it.	shakespearean
You can’t stay here any longer.	modern
Thank you.	modern
The spirit is torturing me.	modern
Let life be short, else shame will be too long.	shakespearean
Unfought withal, but I will sell my dukedom To buy a slobb'ry and a dirty farm In that nook-shotten isle of Albion.	shakespearean

Give me some wine and let me say a few words.	modern
It does, my boy.	shakespearean
Don’t worry.	modern

A most ridiculous monster, to make a wonder of a poor drunkard.	shakespearean
Remind Richard of this, and he will weep.	modern
Now is the winter of our discontent Made glorious summer by this son of York, And all the clouds that loured upon our house In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.	shakespearean

Bad friends were.	modern
Charmian, did I ever love Caesar as much as this?	modern
Nay, ’tis most certain, Iras.	shakespearean

I’m determined to be heard by someone.	modern
I thank your Highness.	modern
How do you mean, “conspired”?	modern
My only sin was loving you too much.	modern
An honest tale succeeds best when it is told simply.	modern
Tis wonderful.	shakespearean
Let me but move one question to your daughter, And by that fatherly and kindly power That you have in her, bid her answer truly.	shakespearean
I took good care of you—piece of filth that you are—and let you stay in my own hut until you tried to rape my daughter.	modern
I’ll leave you now to chatter and gossip like an old woman.	modern
Excuse me, young man, how do I get to the Jew’s residence?	modern
How doth the prince?	shakespearean
Since he went into France, I have been in continual practice.	shakespearean
Yet could I bear that too, well, very well.	shakespearean
It was Kent, sir, the exiled Kent, who, after the king treated him like an enemy of the state, put on a disguise and followed his king, carrying out tasks unworthy of even a slave.	modern
It’s tragic because Pyramus kills himself.	modern
Is that the man you want?	modern
My lord, I cannot.	shakespearean
I prithee, who?	shakespearean
What right did he have to scold me like that?	modern
We’ll meet Macbeth there.	modern
But you’ll see that the very thing that joins them will be the thing that separates them.	modern
It is good for your green wound and your ploody coxcomb.	shakespearean
I shall win at the odds.	shakespearean
What an ogre you are to slander someone you don’t know, and who doesn’t know you!	modern
There’s my hat!	modern
How now, fellow?	shakespearean
A man of great influence.	modern
Killing him once is not enough revenge.	modern
Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode.	shakespearean
That pale face of yours will frighten the others as well.	modern
Do the boys carry it away?	shakespearean
Throw some of your words at me.	modern
Is ’t possible, friend Litio, that mistress Bianca Doth fancy any other but Lucentio?	shakespearean
Mine would, sir, were I human.	shakespearean
Caesar, what did my stay in Egypt have to do with you?	modern
Look here, this is the entrance to his room.	modern
If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will do your mother’s commandment.	shakespearean
You were right the first time.	modern
What is the matter there?	shakespearean
By the mass, I was about to say something.	shakespearean
He wasn’t sad, because he knows that his disposition affects others.	modern
Your Majesty didn’t present yourself as the king.	modern
An interlude!	shakespearean
What, in my presence?	modern
But that they call “compliment” is like th' encounter of two dog- apes.	shakespearean
Who calls so coldly?	modern
Who was it that came here?	modern
So should he look That seems to speak things strange.	shakespearean
Thou hast some suit to Caesar, hast thou not?	shakespearean
God grant that some, less noble and less loyal, Nearer in bloody thoughts, and not in blood, Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did, And yet go current from suspicion.	shakespearean
I have made your daughter mine by marriage while false impressions blinded your eyes.	modern
What is your wish with regard to her?	modern
Dear master, I can’t go any farther.	modern
Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right breed.	shakespearean
Come, blade, my breast imbrue.	shakespearean
If it isn’t my old friend Grumio—and my dear friend Petruchio!	modern
Oh, a plague has been prevented, thank God!	modern
I think he’s actually serious, and not just being polite.	modern
I am not a child or an infant.	modern
So, it will make us mad.	shakespearean
I don’t feel any urge to see a more handsome man than this one.	modern
Poison never landed on such an ugly toad.	modern
Why not stay and hear me talk to him?	modern
Not a false gallop.	shakespearean
Thou makest me merry.	shakespearean
Oh God!	modern
Motley’s the only wear.	shakespearean
Hello, everyone!	modern
I prithee, shepherd, if that love or gold Can in this desert place buy entertainment, Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed.	shakespearean
Whoever is born on a day I forget to send a message to Antony will die a beggar.	modern
Sadly, it’s the king that’s missing.	modern
It means being filled with fantasy; with passion and wishes; with adoration, loyalty, and devotion.	modern
List'ning their fear I could not say “Amen,” When they did say “God bless us!” Consider it not so deeply.	shakespearean
What do you mean by “furniture”?	modern
But will you woo this wildcat?	shakespearean
Let him write down the Prince’s officer “coxcomb.” Come, bind them.—Thou naughty varlet!	shakespearean
I guess you don’t want it.	modern
The earth hath bubbles, as the water has, And these are of them.	shakespearean
My noble king, my friends have informed me that Sir Edward Courtney and his brother, the haughty Bishop of Exeter, are now in  My king, the Guildfords in  My lord, the duke of Buckingham’s army— Enough, you	modern
Very soon, because you want it.	modern
Whether you are sad or merry, the intensity of either suits you like no one else . . .	modern
I will go before, sir.— Mistress, look out at window, for all this.	shakespearean
Give me your present to one Master Bassanio, who indeed gives rare new liveries.	shakespearean
The reasons for his death are recorded in the Capitol.	modern
Come, Dolabella, see High order in this great solemnity.	shakespearean
Your features, Lord warrant us!	shakespearean
And I won’t be there either.—Edmund, I’m told you’ve acted like a true son to your father.	modern
Who’s sleeping in the second chamber?	modern
Oh, but these are our friends.	modern
Your dinner, and the generous islanders By you invited, do attend your presence.	shakespearean
How many people are cowards at heart but wear beards like Hercules or Mars, the god of war?	modern
My lord, you know I’m your friend.	modern
Yes, we’re the privates in her army.	modern
What have I kept back?	shakespearean
Should we watch this ridiculous scene?	modern
He is, my lord, and safe in Leicester, where, if you’d like, we can retreat to.	modern
We’re in.	modern
He’s hot-tempered, and he might try to hit you with his staff.	modern
You’re talking in such a crazy way, sir.	modern
I wonder if you’d be so good, you lousy, rotten villain, to grant my wish and my request and gratify me, see, by eating this leek.	modern
Thou hast seen a farmer’s dog bark at a beggar?	shakespearean
You have said, but whether wisely or no, let the forest judge.	shakespearean
Ratcliffe, come hither.	shakespearean
Now what?	modern
I am arrogant, vengeful, ambitious, with more ill will in me than I can fit into my thoughts, and more than I have time to carry it out in.	modern
O, cleave, my sides!	shakespearean
Tis a good hand, A frank one.	shakespearean
My wayward husband hath a hundred times	shakespearean
No, because my manly heart is grieving.	modern
But listen, if	modern
He’s serious.	modern
Safer than trust too far.	shakespearean
He didn’t ask questions, but answered ours at length.	modern
I’m telling you, get out of here, and don’t follow me around like this.	modern
I’ll say goodbye once more.	modern
The hearts of old gave hands, But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.	shakespearean
No, our general’s infatuation is out of control.	modern
But since your father doesn’t want him to marry you, you have to consider Demetrius to be the better man.	modern
I have known when he would have walked ten mile afoot to see a good armor, and now will he lie ten nights awake carving the fashion of a new doublet.	shakespearean
Look for him, Titinius, while I go to meet the noble Brutus and force him to hear this news.	modern
Thou shalt, I warrant thee.	shakespearean
Go, hurry.	modern
Are you hiding your forehead with a golden crown, when, if there was any justice in this world, it should be branded with the murders you committed—your slaughter of the prince who held that crown, and of my sons and my brothers?	modern
Take a few steps—I want to see you walk.	modern
Shall we sound him?	shakespearean
They’re forgiven, then, if they don’t see what they’re doing.	modern
How is Hamlet?	modern
But manhood is melted into curtsies, valor into compliment, and men are only turned into tongue, and trim ones too.	shakespearean
But get thee back.	shakespearean
His glory has not been diminished where he earned it, nor have those offenses for which he was killed been exaggerated.	modern
Your name is Lucentio, you say.	modern
O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed!	shakespearean
Step aside.	modern
To go out of my dialect, which you discommend so much.	shakespearean
Speak this no more.	shakespearean
Why did you leave me alone so unkindly?	modern
My master, and my lord!	shakespearean
What you have charged me with, that have I done— And more, much more.	shakespearean
Cassius, Be not deceived.	shakespearean
Trust me, I could do much— Prithee, no more.	shakespearean
Murder most foul, as in the best it is.	shakespearean
I hope I never achieve success if I don’t feel some of your heartbroken grief right now.	modern
So be it, Dolabella.	modern
I would thou couldst.	shakespearean
The French ambassador arrived at that moment and asked to see the king.	modern
His lecture will be done ere you have tuned.	shakespearean
Dost thou squiny at me?	shakespearean
As from your graves rise up, and walk like sprites, To countenance this horror!	shakespearean
And now he’s gone.	modern
Fair sister, will you go with the princes or stay here with me?	modern
Demetrius loves her, and he loves not you.	shakespearean
Come, let’s be off!	modern
Did Diana ever beautify a grove as much as Kate beautifies this room with her queenly movements?	modern
Here comes Catesby again.	modern
Ratcliffe, around midnight come to my tent and help me put on my armor.	modern
Good grandam, tell us, is our father dead?	shakespearean
Sweet Moon, I thank you for your sunny beams.	modern
God bless the island of Cyprus and our noble general Othello!	modern
The poor thing, he is so shaken with a fever that it’s terrible to see.	modern
I have done wrong, so I will suffer wrong.	modern
I would I had thy inches.	shakespearean
Yes, and that’s a serious failing.	modern
My dukedom to a beggarly denier, I do mistake my person all this while!	shakespearean
Loss upon loss!	modern
I grant you, friends, if you should fright the ladies out of their wits, they would have no more discretion but to hang us.	shakespearean
Hey, let’s have some music here!	modern
I will not rise unless your Highness hear me.	shakespearean
But how, my lord, shall we resist it now?	shakespearean
Don Pedro is here.	modern
What if she won’t kiss me?	modern
Not altogether so, sir.	shakespearean
Who could refrain, That had a heart to love, and in that heart Courage to make ’s love known?	shakespearean
Come, good Athenian.	shakespearean
Isn’t that strange?	modern
Give me your hand, Leonato.	modern
Nay, good Lysander.	shakespearean
One of them rates All that is won and lost.	shakespearean
I will do ’t.	shakespearean
God gives you one face, but you paint another on top of it.	modern
My very hairs do mutiny, for the white Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them For fear and doting.	shakespearean
My lord, here is the entrance.	modern
Someone whose mood is as foul as the weather, very troubled.	modern
I embrace it.	shakespearean
Yet they are not joined.	shakespearean
The soldier’s pole is fall’n!	shakespearean
And I remember the wooing of a peascod instead of her, from whom I took two cods and, giving her them again, said with weeping tears, “Wear these for my sake.” We that are true lovers run into strange capers.	shakespearean
Finish, good lady.	shakespearean
How now, spirit?	shakespearean
She wants to have a word with you in her bedroom before you go to bed.	modern
I will only be bold with Benedick for his company, for from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot he is all mirth.	shakespearean
Question it, Horatio.	shakespearean
If she is, you can sue me for lying to you.	modern
Now, sweet lord, You know the goodness I intend upon you.	shakespearean
No, no, I can’t, really.	modern
You are merry, my lord.	shakespearean
Look, how she rubs her hands.	shakespearean
If Caesar had stabbed their mothers they would have done no less.	shakespearean
This would have seemed a period To such as love not sorrow, but another To amplify too much would make much more And top extremity.	shakespearean
Master young gentleman, I pray you, which is the way to Master Jew’s?	shakespearean
The concernancy, sir?	shakespearean
I am friends with you all and love you all, on one condition—that you prove to me that Caesar was dangerous.	modern
Use Desdemona well.	shakespearean
Farewell to you both.	modern
Yes, and I’ll do everything I just said.	modern
Come, Menas.	shakespearean
Godspeed, fair Helena!	shakespearean
There was never counterfeit of passion came so near the life of passion as she discovers it.	shakespearean
There isn’t any other way, unless you took on another form and became someone else.	modern
Oh, it’s too terrible.	modern
Hark, how these instruments summon to supper.	shakespearean
Have you ever slept before while such a terrible deed was done?	modern
Run, everyone, run!	modern
So what do you say to my suit?	modern
It is not destiny’s fault, but our own faults, that we’re slaves.	modern
Indeed, we have many good days to look forward to!	modern
Under this conjuration, speak, my lord, For we will hear, note, and believe in heart That what you speak is in your conscience washed As pure as sin with baptism.	shakespearean
But I shall see The wingèd vengeance overtake such children.	shakespearean
Get busy, go!	modern
By this hand, I love thee.	shakespearean
Do you know me, my lord?	shakespearean
And since you know you cannot see yourself So well as by reflection, I, your glass, Will modestly discover to yourself That of yourself which you yet know not of.	shakespearean
By your leave, hostess.	shakespearean
Is this possible, my lord?	modern
Admit you were wrong.	modern
Wilt thou be pleased to hearken once again to the suit I made to thee?	shakespearean
You have been factious one against the other.— Wife, love Lord Hastings.	shakespearean
Bear me, good friends, where Cleopatra bides.	shakespearean
You’re kidding!	modern
The whole world wants her.	modern
But what of that?	shakespearean
Is not this true?	shakespearean
My master calls me.	shakespearean
By my soul I swear There is no power in the tongue of man To alter me.	shakespearean
We’ll bring him to his house with shouts and clamors.	shakespearean
Do we have devils on the island?	modern
But, for certain, He cannot buckle his distempered cause Within the belt of rule.	shakespearean
One word more, honest neighbors.	shakespearean
Damn you!	modern
But what talk I of this?	shakespearean
Fly, my lord, fly.	shakespearean
I will be heard.	shakespearean
Damn you all!	modern
Easy, Petruchio.	modern
So, This is to horse.	shakespearean
Fight valiantly today.	shakespearean
And you are come in very happy time To bear my greeting to the senators And tell them that I will not come today.	shakespearean
How are you, your highness?	modern
The tyrannous and bloody act is done, The most arch deed of piteous massacre That ever yet this land was guilty of.	shakespearean
Yes, gentle cousin, if it were light enough for you.	modern
Oh, I suffered along with all the men I watched suffer!	modern
Come forth, I say!	shakespearean
Of princes in this number And nobles bearing banners, there lie dead One hundred twenty-six.	shakespearean
He refuses, as he is free of vanity and self-serving pride and ascribes all the glory and responsibility for victory to God.	modern
Sleep well there on the ground.	modern
The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.	shakespearean
There’s not, I think, a subject That sits in heart-grief and uneasiness Under the sweet shade of your government.	shakespearean
Yet he hath ever but slenderly known himself.	shakespearean
Why, so didst thou.	shakespearean
I had rather have my horse to my mistress.	shakespearean
I have two nights watched with you but can perceive no truth in your report.	shakespearean
Had our general Been what he knew himself, it had gone well.	shakespearean
Crystal is muddy.	shakespearean
Thou art The armorer of my heart.	shakespearean
I am called Dercetus.	shakespearean
Rumor it abroad That Anne my wife is very grievous sick.	shakespearean
This will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I shall have my music for nothing.	shakespearean
He’s not sleeping to fatten up his lazy body, but praying, to nourish his attentive soul.	modern
What traitor hears me and says not “Amen?” England hath long been mad and scarred herself.	shakespearean
Since you asked, I suppose it’s not bragging to say that we are.	modern
Eros, my young friend, your captain is now just like that cloud.	modern
Cambio is changed into Lucentio.	shakespearean
And I will sing it in the latter end of a play before the duke.	shakespearean
Why, what symptoms of love does she exhibit?	modern
No, please don’t hate him—for my sake.	modern
Oh, ho!	modern
But I will punish home.	shakespearean
If I should be?	shakespearean
Support him by the arm.	shakespearean
How handsome it is.	modern
Procreation is a good thing, but if your daughter gets pregnant … look out, friend.	modern
Oh, did he so?	shakespearean
What did you say?	modern
Tell me.	modern
And how do you like Lord Bassanio’s wife?	modern
Remember what I have said.	shakespearean
Darkness and devils!	shakespearean
I wish I could sleep too—it would stop me from thinking.	modern
You’re a fool.	modern
It’s almost morning, but I’m sure you’re not fully satisfied about what happened.	modern
Beatrice— I swear, I’m going.	modern
Petruchio, let’s stand over here awhile.	modern
Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.” Must give—for what?	shakespearean
I heard him swear he did.	modern
Then put up your pipes in your bag, for I’ll away.	shakespearean
Caesar shall forth.	shakespearean
When grown-ups teach little children, they do it gently and easily.	modern
Yes, Celia, we kept her here for your sake.	modern
Have you forgotten her?	modern
You knew—no one knew, no one knew as well as you did—about my daughter’s plans to run away.	modern
It looks a little paler.	shakespearean
Th' ambassadors from Norway, my good lord, Are joyfully returned.	shakespearean
We’ll leave tonight and be home a day before our husbands get back.	modern
This prince hath neither claimed it nor deserved it And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it.	shakespearean
Where had he wine?	shakespearean
But, oh no!	modern
And I’ll neigh like a horse and bark like a hound and grunt like a pig and roar like a bear and burn like a fire at every turn.	modern
Ay, widow Dido.	shakespearean
Right over to that  I hope he enjoys her.	modern
Amen, say we.	shakespearean
Now, then, we’ll use His countenance for the battle, which being done, Let her who would be rid of him devise His speedy taking off.	shakespearean
Royal Queen!	shakespearean
I thought the king had more affected the Duke of Albany than Cornwall.	shakespearean
Be not so.	shakespearean
But what’s your trade?	modern
He has always loved Cordelia best, and his bad judgment in disowning her now is obvious.	modern
Stand aside, Captain Gower.	modern
St. George loses his holiness once  Then, by myself— You’ve misused yourself.	modern
Swords don’t frighten me.	modern
Nay, lay thee down and roar, For thou hast killed the sweetest innocent That e'er did lift up eye.	shakespearean
I stay too long.	shakespearean
I have no ambition To see a goodlier man.	shakespearean
You are deceived.	shakespearean
Oh no, sir, I won’t let him go, sir, not without a good reason.	modern
All the spirits hate him as much as I do.	modern
You’ll make me angry.	modern
Your betters have endured me say my mind, And if you cannot, best you stop your ears.	shakespearean
Oh wicked wall, through which I don’t see any happiness!	modern
Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through.	shakespearean
Thou must know, ’Tis not my profit that does lead mine honor; Mine honor, it.	shakespearean
I think it’s important.	modern
The person who suffers alone suffers the most.	modern
A good man’s fortune may grow out at heels.	shakespearean
What he hath uttered I have writ my sister.	shakespearean
Wait, Petruchio, I should go with you.	modern
And when the mind is engaged, the rest of the body, dead and dull before, wakes up and comes to life with a new nimbleness and sensitivity, like a snake shedding its dead skin.	modern
Discipline must be kept.	modern
You’re my true and honorable wife, as dear to me as the blood that runs through my sad heart.	modern
Usually that means a person is foolish.	modern
I do not well know, my lord.	shakespearean
Then let’s meet with our senior command and discuss what to do next.	modern
One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.	shakespearean
But I’ll stop rebuking you.	modern
Or, if you will, Come home to me, and I will wait for you.	shakespearean
Here, kiss the book.	shakespearean
Let this pernicious hour Stand aye accursèd in the calendar!	shakespearean
Here’s what you’ll do.	modern
Upon the right hand I.	shakespearean
Do not yourself such wrong, who are in this Relieved but not betrayed.	shakespearean
Come, come.	shakespearean
How low am I?	shakespearean
Murder has no tongue, but miraculously it still finds a way to speak.	modern
Answer me in a word.	modern
Dost thou know me, fellow?	shakespearean
So he served the second, and so the third.	shakespearean
But what am I afraid of?	modern
Harp not on that string, madam; that is past.	shakespearean
Now I’ll tell you the other story about my journey.	modern
By the moon and stars!	modern
Her blush is guiltiness, not modesty.	shakespearean
There were no primary ones.	modern
She’s a most triumphant lady, if report be square to her.	shakespearean
You wanted to be king of the island, sir?	modern
You have forgotten, and you think it’s a burden when I ask you to walk through the ocean, or run on the north wind, or do business for me underground when the earth’s frozen solid.	modern
It touches you, my lord, as much as me.	shakespearean
O wise and upright judge!	shakespearean
What’s that?	modern
Get away from me, witch!” the fat woman cried.	modern
The young generation rises while the old one falls.	modern
Something about Cyprus.	modern
My lord, I claim the gift, my due by promise, For which your honor and your faith is pawned— Th' earldom of Hereford and the movables Which you promisèd I shall possess.	shakespearean
You think he’s special, since you’ve only ever seen him and Caliban.	modern
Doesn’t that rising blush suggest that she is virtuous and innocent?	modern
What victory does he bring home?	modern
Give me that boy and I’ll come with you.	modern
Heaven keep you safe!	modern
Prithee, listen well.	shakespearean
For when she saw— Which never shall be found—you did suspect She had disposed with Caesar, and that your rage Would not be purged, she sent you word she was dead.	shakespearean
Let’s listen to the moon.	modern
What’s the matter, think you?	shakespearean
But when they should endure the bloody spur, They fall their crests and, like deceitful jades, Sink in the trial.	shakespearean
If there be any impediment, I pray you discover it.	shakespearean
Do you not know me, Father?	shakespearean
These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.	shakespearean
He hath commission from thy wife and me To hang Cordelia in the prison and To lay the blame upon her own despair, That she fordid herself.	shakespearean
I don’t know why I should be afraid, since I haven’t done anything wrong.	modern
You’re less happy, being feared, than they are in fearing you.	modern
Yes, they are.	modern
Yes, I’ll wipe my mind clean of all trivial facts and memories and preserve only your commandment there.	modern
Didn’t you tell me that I’d be able to recognize the man by the Athenian clothes he was wearing?	modern
Mankind is so beautiful!	modern
You go ahead, and I will follow you.	modern
How long will a man lie in his grave before he starts to rot?	modern
Now the time is right for us to speak, and we do so with imperial authority.	modern
Therefore no more but to the matter.	shakespearean
That’s what’s driving her crazy.	modern
Lucius!—Fast asleep?	shakespearean
Oh, my fortunes have Corrupted honest men!	shakespearean
Tis bootless to exclaim.	shakespearean
There are lots of ways to get on the general’s good side again.	modern
Even the fragile wren, the smallest of birds, will fight against the owl when it threatens her young ones in the nest.	modern
You can’t do that.	modern
He shall do this, or else I do recant The pardon that I late pronouncèd here.	shakespearean
Cupid is a knavish lad  Thus to make poor females mad.	shakespearean
We’ll away tonight, And be a day before our husbands home.	shakespearean
I am ashamed that women are so simple To offer war where they should kneel for peace; Or seek for rule, supremacy and sway When they are bound to serve, love, and obey.	shakespearean
them brothers, friends, and countrymen.	modern
Now, beshrew my father’s ambition!	shakespearean
Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest?	shakespearean
Your husband, being saddled with a shrew, projects his own suffering onto my husband.	modern
Who says he is?	modern
We’re to be married on Sunday.	modern
Have more than you show, Speak less than you know, Lend less than you owe.	modern
But come thy ways.	shakespearean
Come hither, herald.—Let the trumpet sound,— And read out this.	shakespearean
I found Orlando under a tree, like a dropped acorn.	modern
Oh, he’s been betrayed, and I’ve been ruined.	modern
But here are other matters to be dealt with.	modern
I’ll let you know right away how it’s going.	modern
You’re too forgiving.	modern
He’s gone?	modern
Your royal preparation Makes us hear something.	shakespearean
If either of you know any inward impediment why you should not be conjoined, charge you on your souls to utter it.	shakespearean
It’s a capital offense for anyone from Mantua to come to Padua.	modern
I’ll think it over.	modern
I wish the lightning had burned up all those logs that you’ve been ordered to stack!	modern
How is ’t with you?	shakespearean
I have to follow him and give him the letter.	modern
Do you remember her face?	modern
See, see, here comes the man we went to seek.	shakespearean
What have you two sisters done?	modern
I' th' air or th' earth?	shakespearean
Canst thou, when thou command’st the beggar’s knee, Command the health of it?	shakespearean
You have not called me so, nor have you cause.	shakespearean
What villains have done this?	shakespearean
His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper.	shakespearean
There’s nothing more.	modern
We have kissed away Kingdoms and provinces.	shakespearean
It was in place where I could not breed no contention with him, but I will be so bold as to wear it in my cap till I see him once again, and then I will tell him a little piece of my desires.	shakespearean
I know I ought to obey my husband, but not now.	modern
If ever thou come to me and say, after tomorrow, “This is my glove,” by this hand I will take thee a box on the ear.	shakespearean
What is your will, sir, that you send for me?	shakespearean
I' faith, i' faith, and both in a tune like two gypsies on a horse.	shakespearean
To lend me arms and aid when I required them, The which you both denied.	shakespearean
Friends am I with you all and love you all Upon this hope: that you shall give me reasons Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous.	shakespearean
O vengeance!	shakespearean
I did them for Edward’s sake—and look how he rewards me.—Oh God, if my prayers don’t satisfy you, and you have to avenge the wrongs I’ve done, at least punish me alone!	modern
His horse is killed, so he’s fighting on foot, risking his life to search out Richmond.	modern
Am not I your Rosalind?	shakespearean
Oh, you mean when Beatrice writes a letter and Hero sees that it has “Benedick” and “Beatrice” written all over it?	modern
Nay, I think it is scurvy, and begin to find myself fopped in it.	shakespearean
Tell us your name, sir, truthfully.	modern
Have your wife attend to her, and bring them along as soon as you can.	modern
Can you blame her then, being a maid yet rosed over with the virgin crimson of modesty, if she deny the appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing self?	shakespearean
I have no great devotion to the deed And yet he hath given me satisfying reasons.	shakespearean
For certain, sir, he is not.	shakespearean
But how long will “ever” last?	modern
Oh, he hath murdered his master!	shakespearean
You’d be a pitiful bird.	modern
Is she not apt?	shakespearean
No doubt, for you wear too many in the first place, and it might be more seemly to make do with fewer.	modern
Because, you know, Pyramus and Thisbe meet by moonlight.	modern
Leave him alone.	modern
I warrant you.	shakespearean
Let’s draw our weapons.	shakespearean
Good heavens, those are difficult directions.	modern
The prince has far outgrown me.	modern
Then you’ll be able to cheer  If he were dead, what would happen to me?	modern
And the queen too, and that presently.	shakespearean
No, vain illusion, so intricately bound up with a king’s rest.	modern
It has caused the downfall of many kings.	modern
If what he might he is not, I would to heaven he were!	shakespearean
This forest doesn’t seem deserted when you’re here, because you are all the world to me.	modern
I hope you get what you desire!	modern
Ah, thou spell!	shakespearean
Will you play this recorder?	modern
And he’s made the holiest vows to me, to back up what he says.	modern
Doesn’t the sun shine palely down on them, as though in contempt, killing their fruit with frowns?	modern
I look forward to getting to know you better, Mr. Mustardseed.	modern
Nor know I aught By me that’s said or done amiss this night, Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice, And to defend ourselves it be a sin When violence assails us.	shakespearean
If not, elsewhere they meet with charity.	shakespearean
Let him think about his own debt.	modern
Ay, my commander.	shakespearean
Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm!	shakespearean
Marry, that should you if I were your mistress, or I should think my honesty ranker than my wit.	shakespearean
I’m not in the mood.	modern
My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio, We two will leave you.	shakespearean
Could I repair what she will wear in me As I can change these poor accoutrements, 'Twere well for Kate and better for myself.	shakespearean
What sayest thou, Biondello?	shakespearean
The time to come.	shakespearean
Hear me, hear me what I say: he that strikes the first stroke, I’ll run him up to the hilts, as I am a soldier.	shakespearean
But Roderigo, if you’re as courageous and determined as I think you are, then wait just a bit longer.	modern
Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.	shakespearean
To ’t, luxury, pell-mell—for I lack soldiers.	shakespearean
Nay, ’tis no matter, sir, what he 'leges in Latin.	shakespearean
When it’s paid, bring your friend back.	modern
I’ll to England.	shakespearean
Let’s go.	modern
May God reward you for your kindness!	modern
Why, would not you?	shakespearean
That’s all one.	shakespearean
The Emperor is calling for Canidius.	modern
Don’t sleep so close to me.	modern
Now, were not I a little pot and soon hot, my very lips might freeze to my teeth, my tongue to the roof of my mouth, my heart in my belly, ere I should come by a fire to thaw me.	shakespearean
Where am I going?	modern
Go look and then do the talking yourselves.	modern
Meet me in a little while at the citadel.	modern
Why, you’re absolutely right, cousin.	modern
He looks like someone with a strange tale to tell.	modern
There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.	shakespearean
Oh, the world hath not a sweeter creature, she might lie by an emperor’s side and command him tasks.	shakespearean
Well, then, I hope he chokes on it!	modern
I must attend on Caesar.	shakespearean
Today he fought as though he were a god who hated mankind.	modern
Yes, bring me word, boy, if thy lord look well, For he went sickly forth.	shakespearean
Oh, but I’m worried.	modern
He has distinguished himself as a great soldier in his own right, deserving more than any honor your can bestow on him.	modern
While you were dazed by grief—which isn’t appropriate for a man like you—Cassio showed up here.	modern
Which of these is he?	shakespearean
Regarding the Dauphin, you can speak to me.	modern
Where hast thou been, sister?	shakespearean
If you can’t remember the stupidest little thing love made you do, you haven’t loved.	modern
Is he attacking the heartland of Poland or some frontier?	modern
Is that true, my lords of England?	modern
The general is talking to you!	modern
Is the single man lucky, then?	modern
O, teach me how you look and with what art You sway the motion of Demetrius' heart.	shakespearean
If your master wants a queen to beg from him, you should tell him that a queen will beg for no less than a kingdom.	modern
Do you find Your patience so predominant in your nature That you can let this go?	shakespearean
A beggar, brother?	shakespearean
Then Caesar and he will always be united.	modern
Signior Gremio, came you from the church?	shakespearean
That’s exactly what they said.	modern
Not so, my lord.	shakespearean
Here we.	shakespearean
Give my regards to Hastings, Catesby.	modern
And who is England’s king but an heir of the great York?	modern
Then I know My answer must be made.	shakespearean
Are you ill?	modern
Do not approach Till thou dost hear me call.	shakespearean
Very near, my master.	modern
There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats, For I am armed so strong in honesty That they pass by me as the idle wind, Which I respect not.	shakespearean
Let go of his arm.	modern
Will you abandon such gentle lambs, God, and throw them to the wolves?	modern
Have him come to me here, soldier.	modern
Right now I’m away from home and I can’t provide you with proper care.	modern
There is a poor old man who, purely out of love, has limped after me for miles.	modern
She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed.	shakespearean
As long as they didn’t do anything, it would only be a minor sin.	modern
He that is giddy thinks the world turns round”— I pray you, tell me what you meant by that.	shakespearean
It’s true, and he asked me to beg you both to attend.	modern
So hath my lord dared him to single fight.	shakespearean
I must needs report the truth.	shakespearean
Go and tell my daughter I want to speak with her.	modern
Poison never came from such a sweet place.	modern
Good my friends, consider You are my guests.	shakespearean
Thus hath he lost sixpence a day during his life.	shakespearean
All right then, legitimate brother Edgar, I have to have your lands.	modern
My lord, he’s afraid you mean him harm.	modern
Oh, control yourself, lady!	modern
The glowworm shows the matin to be near, And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire.	shakespearean
Ink and paper, Charmian.	shakespearean
I feel bad for scaring you like this, but it would be much worse for me to let you come to harm.	modern
I’ll make a sop o' th' moonshine of you.	shakespearean
Kill Brutus, and be honored in his death.	shakespearean
I am.	modern
Bind fast his corky arms.	shakespearean
Not till God make men of some other metal than earth.	shakespearean
We’re at your service, my lord.	modern
Hear the noble Antony.	shakespearean
You will answer, “The slaves are ours.” So do I answer you.	shakespearean
Good girl, give it to me.	modern
Then Desdemona and Othello will go back to Venice.	modern
Were it not better, Because that I am more than common tall, That I did suit me all points like a man?	shakespearean
My heart feels like it’s about to explode.	modern
And what they may incense him to, being apt To have his ear abused, wisdom bids fear.	shakespearean
I’m a foolish, senile old man, eighty-something years old, not an hour more or less.	modern
Nay, good, be patient.	shakespearean
It would be better to die that way than to die from being mocked, which is as bad as being killed by tickling.	modern
Nevertheless, it’s all one—the two rivers are as alike as my fingers are to my fingers, and there are salmon in both.	modern
I was not angry since I came to France Until this instant.	shakespearean
Sir, I will answer any thing.	shakespearean
Well, this is what happens when men let themselves be ruled by women.	modern
I’ve outshot you, and not for the first time.	modern
What says that fool of Hagar’s offspring, ha?	shakespearean
Did it stay a long time?	modern
With the permission of Brutus and the others—for Brutus is an honorable man; they are all honorable men—I have come here to speak at Caesar’s funeral.	modern
Let me ask you something in private.	modern
I thank thee for that jest.	shakespearean
I don’t want to be cured, boy.	modern
Well, I wish you liked me.	modern
For divers unknown reasons, I beseech you, Grant me this boon.	shakespearean
Best you safed the bringer Out of the host.	shakespearean
You pay him then.	shakespearean
What evil and deceitful mirror made me think I could rival Hermia’s starry eyes?	modern
You have a beautiful half-sister, Octavia.	modern
She knows the heat of a luxurious bed.	shakespearean
The most infectious pestilence upon thee!	shakespearean
Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?	shakespearean
Nay, their endeavor keeps in the wonted pace.	shakespearean
Yea, marry, dost thou hear, Balthasar?	shakespearean
You call me misbeliever, cutthroat dog, And spet upon my Jewish gaberdine— And all for use of that which is mine own.	shakespearean
Since Cleopatra died, I have lived in such dishonor that the gods despise my disgrace.	modern
Tom’s a-cold.	shakespearean
Yes, certainly, and out of doubt and out of question, too, and ambiguities.	shakespearean
That is hot ice and wondrous strange snow.	shakespearean
It’s just my bad luck.	modern
Oh, let the heavens Give him defense against the elements, For I have lost him on a dangerous sea.	shakespearean
We’ll look for new friends and keep the company of strangers.	modern
Of course.	modern
Get thee gone.	shakespearean
I think one of them is nearby and can’t get away.	modern
joy except my love for you, and I find that only your majesty’s love makes me happy.	modern
Come out.	modern
Who brought it?	shakespearean
You dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy.	shakespearean
Poor Tom, thy horn is dry.	shakespearean
Please say no more.	modern
And here my mistress.	shakespearean
A pox of drowning thyself!	shakespearean
Go to, then!	shakespearean
Then follow me and give me audience, friends.	shakespearean
I wish I could repay this happy news with good news of my own.	modern
If thou hadst feared to break an oath by Him, Th' imperial metal circling now thy head Had graced the tender temples of my child, And both the princes had been breathing here, Which now, two tender bedfellows for dust, Thy broken faith hath made the prey for worms.	shakespearean
I’ll fish for thee and get thee wood enough.	shakespearean
O day untowardly turned!	shakespearean
Yes, it’s just clothing.	modern
The fold stands empty in the drownèd field, And crows are fatted with the murrain flock.	shakespearean
Thou liest, thou shag-haired villain!	shakespearean
Are you kidding?	modern
The last was I that felt thy tyranny.	shakespearean
I can help you find a wife who’s rich, young, beautiful, and reared in a manner fit for a gentlewoman.	modern
I heard thee say even now thou lik’st not that When Cassio left my wife.	shakespearean
Throw physic to the dogs; I’ll none of it.	shakespearean
Even then this forkèd plague is fated to us When we do quicken.	shakespearean
I must not say no.	shakespearean
They pulled out the guts of the sacrificed animal and couldn’t find its heart.	modern
Good cheer, Antonio!	shakespearean
If he has a face like yours, a good scratching couldn’t make him look any worse.	modern
The prayers of saints and those that Richard wronged support us like high-walled fortresses.	modern
Yes, but he’d deny it all.	modern
Yes, and the best looking too.	modern
A good plan, warrior king.	modern
Madam wife, they say that I have dreamed And slept above some fifteen year or more.	shakespearean

Oh, good old man, you’re a great example of that old work ethic, where people worked because it was their duty, not just for the money.	modern
No, dear Queen, For we intend so to dispose you as Yourself shall give us counsel.	shakespearean
Are you going riding this afternoon?	modern
Alack, for mercy!	shakespearean
See” ’t shalt thou never.—Fellows, hold the chair.— Upon these eyes of thine I’ll set my foot.	shakespearean
To leave his wife, to leave his babes, His mansion and his titles in a place From whence himself does fly?	shakespearean
Let’s carry him to the barracks.	modern
Put on my crown.	shakespearean
I know you well.	modern
I hope your Majesty is pear me testimony and witness, and will avouchment that this is the glove of Alençon that your Majesty is give me, in your conscience now.	shakespearean
But I haven’t eaten anything yet.	modern
Who are you talking to?	modern
Katherina, you may stay.	modern
Why, this is an arrant counterfeit rascal.	shakespearean
My fears can’t actually make you evil.	modern
Ay, sir.	shakespearean
Why would you celebrate it?	modern
What can you swear by now?	modern
You all saw that on the Lupercal feast day I offered him a king’s crown three times, and he refused it three times.	modern
Good my complexion, dost thou think though I am caparisoned like a man, I have a doublet and hose in my disposition?	shakespearean
Watch her.	modern
Yes, good idea; that’s the	modern

Once, on a cold and windy day, when the river Tiber was crashing against its banks, Caesar said to me, “Cassius, I dare you to jump into this rough water with me and swim to that point there.” As soon as he spoke, though I was fully dressed, I plunged in and called for him to follow.	modern
Thou didst drink The stale of horses and the gilded puddle Which beasts would cough at.	shakespearean
What did I do wrong?	modern
Then no man has ever been honest.	modern
Cold, cold, my girl, Even like thy chastity.	shakespearean
Before the days of change, still is it so.	shakespearean
Look who’s here!	modern
Are you going to pay the eight shillings I won from you in a bet?	modern
I saw him not.	shakespearean
What’s she doing now?	modern
Ay, so please your Majesty.	shakespearean
Please don’t make fun of me.	modern
Brutus, what will we do?	modern
Don’t worry, Baptista, you’ll be perfectly satisfied.	modern
I am sick and sullen.	modern
Do you really think so?	modern
No, wench!	shakespearean
Thou worms' meat in respect of a good piece of flesh, indeed.	shakespearean
Why, that’s all one.	shakespearean
Here, noble lord.	modern
But I’ll punish them thoroughly.	modern
Do you hear what I say, lady?	modern
Take up my mistress' gown for his master’s use!	modern
What’s the news among the merchants?	modern
This morning, they’ve flown away and in their place are ravens, crows, and kites, flying over our heads and looking down on us, as though we were sickly prey.	modern
I’m telling you the truth.	modern
It is proved my Lady Hero hath been falsely accused, the Prince and Claudio mightily abused, and Don John is the author of all, who is fled and gone.	shakespearean
Look, sir.	modern
Never contradict him.	modern
Not yet, cousin.	modern
Good night, ladies, good night, sweet ladies, good night, good night.	modern
Alack, for pity!	shakespearean
Yonder comes my master, your brother.	shakespearean
An if you plead as well for them As I can say “nay” to thee for myself, No doubt we bring it to a happy issue.	shakespearean
Pinion him like a thief, bring him before us.	shakespearean
Tell him to surrender.	modern
Oh sir, I accept.	modern
I’ll show you how.	modern
Even if we said that this behavior suits him—though only a man with a perfect character could avoid being disgraced by such antics—there’s no excuse for the extra work we’ve had to take on while he’s been off amusing himself.	modern
I don’t like it.	modern
Or are you just teasing?	modern
She is persuaded I will marry her, out of her own love and flattery, not out of my promise.	shakespearean
Alack, alack!	shakespearean
And liegemen to the Dane.	shakespearean
I’ll make her come, I warrant you, presently.	shakespearean
Octavia is of a holy, cold, and still conversation.	shakespearean
In brief, Sorrow would be a rarity most beloved If all could so become it.	shakespearean
And just try to remember a few rules of life.	modern
As dumb as dirt!	modern
There’s more to this ring than its cash value.	modern
Are those my tents where I perceive the fire?	shakespearean
I do repent me that I put it to you.	shakespearean
Let me comply with you in this garb—lest my extent to the players, which, I tell you, must show fairly outwards, should more appear like entertainment than yours.	shakespearean
Please leave it to me to take care of the burial, as I have more reason to mourn than you do.	modern
O, thou well-skilled in curses, stay awhile, And teach me how to curse mine enemies.	shakespearean
Choose another tack.	modern
Serve you, sir.	shakespearean

But I will tarry.	shakespearean
Captain Macmorris, I think, look you, under your correction, there is not many of your nation—  Of my nation?	shakespearean
Do this immediately, and send him packing.	modern
If the future turns out as I hope it will, I’m all set for success.	modern

Speak’st thou in sober meanings?	shakespearean
I learned it in England, where they have a talent for drinking.	modern
I’ll commute your death sentence.	modern
I’ll venture so much of my hawk or hound, But twenty times so much upon my wife.	shakespearean
Even if marrying her meant I died.	modern
Tell him I’ll take the leek out of his hat on Saint Davy’s Day and slap his head with it.	modern
Long stayed he so.	shakespearean
Goneril with a white beard?	modern
My happiness and yours lie in her.	modern
Oh, that the slave had forty thousand lives!	shakespearean
Why are you so strong and good?	modern
Go, daughter.	modern
What, have you forgot me?	shakespearean
I’ve noticed it myself.	modern
Do not torment me, prithee.	shakespearean
I’m well, and probably will be for a while, as I hear that four feasts are being prepared.	modern
I won’t follow him around with useless pleas anymore.	modern
And died so?	shakespearean
Captain Macmorris, when we have more leisure, see, I will be so bold as to show you I know about the practice of warfare, and that’s that.	modern
You’ll heat my blood.	shakespearean
Fetch me the handkerchief—my mind misgives.	shakespearean
If he fail of that, He will have other means to cut you off.	shakespearean
Once again, what’s the news?	modern
Gentle lady, When I did first impart my love to you, I freely told you, all the wealth I had Ran in my veins.	shakespearean
I mean, the Lord Protector.	shakespearean
If you dare fight today, come to the field.	shakespearean
Pray heaven I be deceived in you.	shakespearean
If your Majesties recall it, the Welsh fought very valiantly in a garden where there were leeks growing, wearing leeks in their Monmouth caps which, your Majesty knows, is to this day a badge of honorable military service.	modern
It’s easy for a liar to pretend to feel sorrow when he actually feels none.	modern
Soldiers, watch carefully.	modern
I gave him the material.	modern
O Caesar, read mine first, for mine’s a suit That touches Caesar nearer.	shakespearean
Shall I tell Caesar what you request from him?	modern
I can only say this about her: if she looked different than she does, she would be ugly, and since she can’t be anything but herself, I don’t like her.	modern
Call to me All my sad captains.	shakespearean
Strato, you’ve slept this whole time.	modern
Then how will we see their own natural tears?	modern
I knew that would be your answer.	modern
Stand further away.	modern
If I may say so, your Majesty, as I see it he would be a coward and a villain not to.	modern
If he won’t stop when he’s told to, then he isn’t one of the Prince’s subjects.	modern
Is ’t come to this?	shakespearean
Hold, hold, my heart, And you, my sinews, grow not instant old, But bear me stiffly up.	shakespearean
Sure I can, father.	modern

Pyramus is coming up to the wall.	modern
Ay, ’twas he that told me on her first.	shakespearean
Kill the poys and the luggage!	shakespearean

Hurry, hurry, close the curtain quick.	modern
We’ll hear the will.	shakespearean
I’m right behind you.	modern
Are you trying to sleep with him?	modern
You have spoken truer than you purposed.	shakespearean
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand, Which must be acted ere they may be scanned.	shakespearean
Yea, even I alone.	shakespearean
Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?	shakespearean
Go as fast as you can.	modern
That’s what I conceive of him.	modern
I ask you, if you have a grudge against me, to kill me now, while your stained hands still reek of blood.	modern
Or I do forget myself?	shakespearean
This doesn’t look like a wedding.	modern
Yes, yes!	modern
Tis no matter how it be in tune, so it make noise enough.	shakespearean
I hope now thou art not drowned.	shakespearean

Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!	shakespearean
The Duke’s in a meeting?	modern
I have no choice.	modern
Why are you yelling at me so angrily?	modern
And, in conclusion, she shall watch all night, And if she chance to nod I’ll rail and brawl, And with the clamor keep her still awake.	shakespearean
Run, run, my lord.	modern
What would she have?	shakespearean
Oh Nerissa, my poor little body is tired of this great big world.	modern
Take  Beatrice, have you come because I called for you?	modern
Belike for want of rain, which I could well Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.	shakespearean
Make it eight and eight.	modern
Goodbye, goodbye.	modern
Drink, servant-monster, when I bid thee.	shakespearean

Lo you, here she comes.	shakespearean
As his body grows uglier with age, his mind rots away as well.	modern
Not her that chides, sir, at any hand, I pray.	shakespearean

If you can’t answer it— Go ahead!	modern
No, you shall not.	modern
Now must the world point at poor Katherine And say, “Lo, there is mad Petruchio’s wife, If it would please him come and marry her!”   Upon my life, Petruchio means but well, Whatever fortune stays him from his word: Though he be blunt, I know him passing wise; Though he be merry, yet withal he’s honest.	shakespearean
You lie up to the hearing of the gods.	shakespearean
I’ll tell the Queen the reason for our quick departure and get her permission to leave.	modern
Thinking, my lord?” My God, you keep repeating everything I say as if you were thinking something too horrible to say out loud.	modern
He says I won’t get into heaven because I’m a Jew’s daughter, and he says you’re irresponsible because by converting Jews to Christianity you’re raising the price of pork.	modern
Are you going to Scone?	modern
Lo, now, lo!	shakespearean
We’ll be your witnesses.	modern
He is, because he told Antonius to tell you he’d be there tomorrow.	modern
Yes, I really think so.	modern
Good running, Thisbe!	modern
But if you steal my reputation, you’re robbing me of something that doesn’t make you richer, but makes me much poorer.	modern
Or stuff what he says into their pockets.	modern
Your life is stretched to its limit.	modern
His letter there Will show you his estate.	shakespearean
When I send for you, come out wearing masks.	modern
O, I die, Horatio.	shakespearean
For when thou gavest them the rod, and put’st down thine own breeches,            Prithee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster that can teach thy fool to lie.	shakespearean
I could do more to help Antony, but to do so would insult him.	modern
We’ll do it.	modern
But wait a minute.	modern
I do beseech you.	shakespearean
You are Antonio, you are he.	modern
O true, good Catesby.	shakespearean
Bid them all fly, For when I am revenged upon my charm, I have done all.	shakespearean
Call the messenger.	shakespearean
But did I fall or not?	modern
At my lodging.	shakespearean
Regan gives good advice.	modern
What havoc have you wreaked in this part of the forest?	modern

Let us rather Hold fast the mortal sword and, like good men, Bestride our downfall'n birthdom.	shakespearean
Let’s proceed.	modern
Avoid, and leave him.	shakespearean
Why, that is nothing.	shakespearean
In fact, every imprisoned man holds in his own hand the tool to free himself.	modern
Let every soldier hew him down a bough And bear ’t before him.	shakespearean
I’ll do ’t, but it dislikes me.	shakespearean
Let’s stab ourselves.	shakespearean
Break an hour’s promise in love?	shakespearean
We’ll watch them starve to death first.	modern
So it should be, that none but Antony Should conquer Antony, but woe ’tis so!	shakespearean
It’s too much.	modern

If that man, who’s made up of conflicts, becomes musical, then there must be something wrong with the universe.	modern
Let your anger fall on me then, even if its sharpness pierces my heart.	modern
What is thy soul of adoration?	shakespearean
Will you give her o'er?	shakespearean

I did it myself.	modern
Would that fault were mine!	shakespearean
What, with my tongue in your tail?	shakespearean
Yet this I will not do, do how I can.	shakespearean
No farther than the Tower, and, as I guess, Upon the like devotion as yourselves, To gratulate the gentle princes there.	shakespearean
My good friends, I’ll see you tomorrow.	modern
You love me not.	shakespearean
What’s important is the urgency of this mission.	modern
Sure, it was the roar Of a whole herd of lions.	shakespearean
And I was just going to yours.	modern
As good cause as one would desire.	shakespearean
You know, you’re right.	modern
By 'r lady, I think it be so.	shakespearean
It is your music, madam, of the house.	shakespearean
My letters say only seventy senators were killed, one being Cicero.	modern
Think it no more.	shakespearean
Yes, just like this.	modern
It is the quality o' th' climate.	shakespearean
Get out, insolent eunuch!	modern
Let’s move again, my friends.	modern
Well, I won’t take it any longer.	modern
This mortal house I’ll ruin, Do Caesar what he can.	shakespearean
I’ll get some cloth and egg whites to bandage his bleeding face.	modern
Time, thou anticipat’st my dread exploits.	shakespearean
He thinks he’s still playing his instrument.	modern
Then say good-bye to me and tell me those tears were for my benefit.	modern
Go ahead, use your authority.	modern
Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow’s shadow.	shakespearean
But how, but how?	shakespearean
But oh, poor Gloucester— Lost he his other eye?	shakespearean
Are you making fun of me?	modern
That’s no lie.	modern
Wouldn’t it be better—since I’m unusually tall for a woman—to dress myself like a man?	modern
Say, how is that?	shakespearean
I’ll bandage up these wounds and swear I got them in the French wars.	modern
Let good Antonio look he keep his day, Or he shall pay for this.	shakespearean
The Jove of power make me most weak, most weak, Your reconciler!	shakespearean
Jove, Jove, this shepherd’s passion Is much upon my fashion.	shakespearean
He’s coming, madam.	shakespearean
Go ahead, swear to that, so you’ll be damned to hell for lying.	modern
It hath not appeared.	shakespearean
Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of this, dies instantly.	shakespearean
Lay out the gown.	modern
Go you and maintain talk with the duke, that my charity be not of him perceived.	shakespearean
Here comes another troop to seek for you.	shakespearean
Thou must be patient.	shakespearean
He could not have ’scaped sixpence a day.	shakespearean
But did you listen to all that poetry without even wondering about what your name is doing on all these trees?	modern
They’ll consider you and Jessica masters of this house in place of Lord Bassanio and myself.	modern
How now, Tubal?	shakespearean
Is she so hot a shrew as she’s reported?	shakespearean
The gown is made Just as my master had direction.	shakespearean
And let his knights have colder looks among you.	shakespearean
But fare you well.	shakespearean
What was it that you told me today—that your niece Beatrice was in love with Signior Benedick?	modern
I don’t care what he told you in Latin.	modern
He was furnished like a hunter.	shakespearean
I have news from Rome, my good lord.	modern
So you had time as you were dying to look around?	modern
My father instructed you in his will to give me a good education.	modern
O, then by day Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough To mask thy monstrous visage?	shakespearean
Three kings I had newly feasted, and did want Of what I was i’ th’ morning.	shakespearean
Here comes other reck'nings.	shakespearean
I’ll cure you of your insolence, and I’m not going to give you a thousand crowns, either!—Hey, Dennis!	modern
They’ll set their watches to whatever time we say.	modern
Not in my house, Lucentio, for you know Pitchers have ears, and I have many servants.	shakespearean
Good sir, this ring was given to me by my wife.	modern
I took him sleeping—that is finished too— And the Athenian woman by his side, That, when he waked, of force she must be eyed.	shakespearean
Your threats are no stronger than her whining.—Helena, I love you.	modern
Here is the head of that ignoble traitor, The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.	shakespearean
Soft, comes he not here?	shakespearean
Didn’t you know?	modern
What then?	shakespearean
And return to us immediately, bringing Messala with you.	modern
Heaven keep the monster from Othello’s mind!	shakespearean
You come to me and you say, “Shylock, we would have moneys.” You say so!— You, that did void your rheum upon my beard And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur Over your threshold!	shakespearean
Oh, I’m sick, sick!	modern
I pray you tell me your remedy.	shakespearean
The gods do this in shame of cowardice.	shakespearean
Should we go inside?	modern
I followed it here, or I should say it dragged me here.	modern
We’ll talk more about this later.—Egeus, I’m overriding your wishes.	modern
Disorder, that hath spoiled us, friend us now.	shakespearean
Therefore beware my censure, and keep your promise.	shakespearean
Our master and mistress are looking for you.	modern
I’ll write straight to my sister To hold my very course.	shakespearean
have lost, and the indignity we have endured, for which he is too insignificant to sufficiently pay us back.	modern
Madam, I’d rather sew my lips shut than tell a lie when my life depends upon it.	modern
You have heard much.	shakespearean
I knew a wench married in an afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to stuff a rabbit, and so may you, sir.	shakespearean
Ay, amen!	shakespearean
So, fare thee well.	shakespearean
What’s with you, my lord?	modern
You can’t blame anyone for it anyone, I say.	modern
Everything that belongs to them is yours.	modern
I’d rather be a squawking bird than an animal like you.	modern
But doth he know that I am in this forest and in man’s apparel?	shakespearean
Cry, “whoa!” to your tongue, please.	modern
What do you say, your Highness, about my just request?	modern
Wrong hath but wrong, and blame the due of blame.	shakespearean
Down, therefore, and beg mercy of the Duke.	shakespearean
There is none but he Whose being I do fear, and under him My genius is rebuked, as it is said Mark Antony’s was by Caesar.	shakespearean
Oh, liars can look so honest!	modern
A lean cheek, which you have not; a blue eye and sunken, which you have not; an unquestionable spirit, which you have not; a beard neglected, which you have not—but I pardon you for that, for simply your having in beard is a younger brother’s revenue.	shakespearean
I am now from home, and out of that provision Which shall be needful for your entertainment.	shakespearean
Oh Ratcliffe, I had a terrifying dream!	modern
If you have any pity, grace, or manners, You would not make me such an argument.	shakespearean
He knows that you didn’t embrace Antony because you loved him, but because you feared him.	modern
Things base and vile, holding no quantity, Love can transpose to form and dignity.	shakespearean
Where I have come, great clerks have purposèd To greet me with premeditated welcomes, Where I have seen them shiver and look pale, Make periods in the midst of sentences, Throttle their practiced accent in their fears, And in conclusion dumbly have broke off, Not paying me a welcome.	shakespearean
I know not, Menas, How lesser enmities may give way to greater.	shakespearean
Quick, quick.	modern
O dainty duck!	shakespearean
I won’t live long enough, and all my efforts will fail me.	modern
Sure it is hers.	shakespearean
I have a venturous fairy that shall seek The squirrel’s hoard and fetch thee new nuts.	shakespearean
Cut my corset laces, Charmian, so I can breathe.	modern
Yes, absolutely, no question or ambiguity about it.	modern
She trembled and shook because he stamped and swore and carried on as though the vicar were trying to put something over on him.	modern
Now the only person I love, and believe in, and want to look at, is Helena.	modern
I don’t know.	modern
When they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar, they will lay out ten to see a dead Indian.	shakespearean
You shall confess that you are both deceived.	shakespearean
They are coming to the play.	shakespearean
Stay close by when we wake him up, ma'am.	modern
Just tell me what you want me to do, and however hard it is, you’ll see that I’m eager to do it.	modern
Maybe, but you’re wrinkled all the same.	modern
I know him; he wears a lock of hair.	modern
Then but forbear your food a little while Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn And give it food.	shakespearean
No, a woman’s gentle brain could never have come up with such crude expressions and even harsher meanings.	modern
Would you like to hear some music, my sweet love?	modern
My lord, my lord— I will not hear you.	shakespearean
Sir, I can’t.	modern
Come, find the conspirators!	modern
I come to ask you out of charity to let us wander over this bloody field to record the numbers of our dead and bury them, separating our nobles from the common men, for many of our princes—alas!—lie drowned and soaked in the blood of mercenary soldiers.	modern
Relax, gentlemen.	modern
Hath there been such a time—I would fain know that— That I have positively said, “'Tis so,” When it proved otherwise?	shakespearean
Away, go!	shakespearean
I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.	shakespearean
Ay, he spoke Greek.	shakespearean
But now I was the lord Of this fair mansion, master of my servants, Queen o'er myself.	shakespearean
And, hark!	shakespearean
The ancient saying is no heresy.	shakespearean
What is thy name, young man?	shakespearean
For hear me, Hero, wooing, wedding, and repenting is as a Scotch jig, a measure, and a cinquepace.	shakespearean
I’ll wait for you in your cave, where you can tell me what you need from me.	modern
If not, I’ll challenge you to a duel.	modern
What did you do that for?	modern
Run away, I beg you!	modern
Oh, heaven help me!	modern
I know her father, though I know not her, And he knew my deceasèd father well.	shakespearean
Who else should it be?	modern
Why, she comes to borrow nothing of them.	shakespearean
Nay, come, again.	shakespearean
Octavius, lead your battle softly on, Upon the left hand of the even field.	shakespearean
Sometime I’d divide, And burn in many places.	shakespearean
Really, I’ll help.	modern
Say that thou overheardst us, And bid her steal into the pleachèd bower Where honeysuckles ripened by the sun Forbid the sun to enter, like favorites Made proud by princes, that advance their pride Against that power that bred it.	shakespearean
That’s the one.	modern
That shall you know hereafter.	shakespearean
Then if they’re negligent, we could control them.	modern
Here’s to your health.	modern
That’s how Claudio will respond.	modern
Oh, let me kiss his hand!	modern
Do it immediately, or all your previous services to me were accidental, without purpose.	modern
Hear me out, my lord.	modern
Tranio got you that time.	modern
Got it?	modern
Why, gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing.	shakespearean
Henry the Sixth, in infant bands crowned king Of France and England, did this king succeed, Whose state so many had the managing That they lost France and made his England bleed, Which oft our stage hath shown.	shakespearean
That’s merciful but a bit careless.	modern
Hence, and avoid my sight!— So be my grave my peace as here I give Her father’s heart from her.—Call France.	shakespearean
Who, me?	modern
Here’s mine.	modern
She doesn’t have anything going for her so far.	modern
Crazy” I’m calling it, since how can you say what craziness is except to say that it’s craziness?	modern
He’ll have to kill both of us, and indeed we’re both men.	modern
It did bass my trespass.	shakespearean
Some o’ their plants are ill-rooted already.	shakespearean
Monster, use your fingers.	modern
The hour of death is approaching.	modern
He does.	shakespearean
What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?	shakespearean
I’ve only done my duty.	modern
He rode that prologue like a wild horse.	modern
Out of my sight!	shakespearean
Love me or love me not, I like the cap, And it I will have, or I will have none.	shakespearean
You’ll just lie there like sleeping dogs and say nothing.	modern
Stand away from the body.	modern
We will not fail.	shakespearean
Have a seat.	modern
Yes, you have seen Cassio and she together.	shakespearean
Renown and grace is dead.	shakespearean
Oh, strange!	shakespearean
The Prince’s fool”!	modern
Therefore I say with noble Buckingham That it is meet so few should fetch the prince.	shakespearean
And should everyone who makes promises and breaks them be hanged?	modern
But our courage should only be the greater for that.	modern
Keep me balanced and sane.	modern
I don’t believe it.	modern
But there’s reason for me to look more closely at this schoolmaster.	modern
With his eyes full of anger.	shakespearean
That’s not what I wish.	modern
Then pack up your instruments and go away.	modern
I warrant you, madam.	shakespearean
You mustn’t hold my earlier outburst against me.	modern
Not here in presence.	shakespearean
As it dissolves, so shall my life.	modern
By Jeshu, I am your Majesty’s countryman, I care not who know it.	shakespearean
Goats and monkeys!	shakespearean
I take no pleasure In aught an eunuch has.	shakespearean
If our general had been his old self, we would have won.	modern
She stood trembling, then suddenly dropped dead.	modern
Where is Gloucester?	modern
Then say at once what is it thou requests.	shakespearean
We, ignorant of ourselves, Beg often our own harms, which the wise powers Deny us for our good, so find we profit By losing of our prayers.	shakespearean
There was, for a while, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question.	shakespearean
Only an hour ago it was nine, and in another hour it will be eleven.	modern
By God, it does look like a camel.	modern
Put color in thy cheek.	shakespearean
Don’t you realize the duke has also banished me, his daughter?	modern
Believe me for mine honor, and have respect to mine honor that you may believe.	shakespearean
No, by Saint Jamy, I’ll bet you a penny!	modern
And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker.	shakespearean
Nay, I’ll help too.	shakespearean
Has Fortune turned on me, like the whore she is?	modern
Now get on with your story.	modern
I appreciate your frankness and your brevity.	modern
Draw your sword, scoundrel, or I’ll slice your thighs like flank steak.	modern
Oh, most bloody sight!	modern
Well, my good lord, I’ll do ’t.	shakespearean
He was on his way here with your wife.	modern
What do you say, my fair  I do not know dat.	modern
Hello, sir.	modern
Take thee that too.	shakespearean
Let’s stay and hear the will.	shakespearean
Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie?	shakespearean
Come on, boy.	modern
Mass, and my elbow itched, I thought there would a scab follow.	shakespearean
Now I’ll stand up.	modern
I ask for him, and he comes.	modern
I prithee now, lead the way without any more talking.— Trinculo, the king and all our company else being drowned, we will inherit here.—Here, bear my bottle.—Fellow Trinculo, we’ll fill him by and by again.	shakespearean
He intends to do something bad to you.	modern
My life has run its circle.	modern
Kill him rather than let him leave this room.	modern
You can argue as much as you like when there’s nothing else to do.	modern
And he’s gone.	shakespearean
She’s an excellent sweet lady, and, out of all suspicion, she is virtuous.	shakespearean
No, I pray thee speak in sober judgment.	shakespearean
Lepidus is high-colored.	shakespearean
I will never be exhibited as lucky Caesar’s prize.	modern
Hello, Iago.	modern
What is it, my good friends?	shakespearean
Yearly will I do this rite.	shakespearean
I knew Temperance—she was a fine girl.	modern
But all the story of the night told over, And all their minds transfigured so together, More witnesseth than fancy’s images And grows to something of great constancy, But, howsoever, strange and admirable.	shakespearean
Lord Hastings, you and he are close.	modern
Are you joking?	modern
Nothing, good sir, except to help Sir Cobweb scratch my head.	modern
You should ask me what time of day it is, instead.	modern
And when you want to go to sleep, I’ll be up laughing like a hyena.	modern
Well, good luck!	modern
Is ’t possible you will away tonight?	shakespearean
Everyone thought it would pass then, and it probably would have had it not been for the great civil unrest and uncertainty of the time, which required the matter to be put off.	modern
I have some business.	shakespearean
The law’s on my side.	modern
And, gentle friends, Let’s kill him boldly but not wrathfully.	shakespearean
You have said now.	shakespearean
Art thou some god, some angel, or some devil That makest my blood cold and my hair to stare?	shakespearean
Let’s have no more of this, let’s to our affairs.—Forgive us our sins!—Gentlemen, let’s look to our business.	shakespearean
Come now, what masques, what dances shall we have To wear away this long age of three hours Between our after-supper and bedtime?	shakespearean
As for me, I’ll leave when I like.	modern
It was my turquoise.	shakespearean
I have done your bidding and fulfilled my promise.	modern
I swear on my life that I’m speaking the truth.	modern
I would fain learn to lie.	shakespearean
There was a pretty redness in his lip, A little riper and more lusty red Than that mixed in his cheek: ’twas just the difference Betwixt the constant red and mingled damask.	shakespearean
I shall grow jealous of you shortly, Launcelot, if you thus get my wife into corners.	shakespearean
When Biondello comes, he waits on thee, But I will charm him first to keep his tongue.	shakespearean
What, To kiss in private?	shakespearean
But prepare yourself for some unpleasantness.	modern
Then there’s still a chance.	modern
Why do you stay so long, my lords of France?	shakespearean
What did Northumberland say about Richmond?	modern
If it were, you would find me such an ordinary king that you would think I’d sold my farm to buy my crown.	modern
Tis much he dares, And to that dauntless temper of his mind He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valor To act in safety.	shakespearean
So long.	modern
To tell you the truth, they fought the new enemy with twice as much force as before; they were like cannons loaded with double ammunition.	modern
Well, old man, I’ll tell you news of your son.	modern
The queen is dead, my lord.	modern
If I can find any animal in this wild forest, I’ll either be food for it or bring it as food for you.	modern
When comes such another?	shakespearean
This’ll be a wonderful kingdom to live in, where they play music for free.	modern
Caesar and Lepidus declared war against Pompey.	modern
Is there division ’twixt my lord and Cassio?	shakespearean
Your castle is surprised, your wife and babes Savagely slaughtered.	shakespearean
Octavia weeps at the thought of leaving Rome.	modern
Our good old friend, Lay comforts to your bosom, and bestow Your needful counsel to our business, Which craves the instant use.	shakespearean
Lucillius and Titinius, order the commanders to have the men camp for the night.	modern
I’m full of joy.	modern
Now, my friendly knave, I thank thee.	shakespearean
Truly, madam, I don’t hear anything.	modern
Your mother was extremely virtuous, and she said you were my daughter.	modern
Madam wife, they say I’ve been dreaming or asleep for more than fifteen years.	modern
Would ’twere done.	shakespearean
I know I won’t please you.	modern
A friend of Antony’s.	shakespearean
Tis a pageant, To keep us in false gaze.	shakespearean
And while thou liv’st, dear Kate, take a fellow of plain and uncoined constancy, for he perforce must do thee right because he hath not the gift to woo in other places.	shakespearean
I have no more royal sons for you to murder.	modern
I was the other day talking on the sea-bank with certain Venetians, and thither comes the bauble and, by this hand, she falls me thus about my neck— Crying “O dear Cassio!” as it were.	shakespearean
Put a candle in my study, Lucius.	modern
What is “t o”clock?	shakespearean
Explain, boy.	modern
Call them.	modern
You interpret my words in a melancholy sense, my hearty friends.	modern
This is practice, Gloucester.	shakespearean
I think she’ll sooner prove a soldier.	shakespearean
What can it not?	shakespearean
I thought that all things had been savage here, And therefore put I on the countenance Of stern commandment.	shakespearean
Come on, my dear Greek philosopher.	modern
Tis time I should inform thee farther.	shakespearean
How goes the world, sir, now?	shakespearean
No drugs or sleeping pills will ever give you the restful sleep that you had last night.	modern
But who dare tell her so?	shakespearean
We achieve things with our intelligence, not by magic, and intelligent planning takes time.	modern
Such was the very armour he had on When he the ambitious Norway combated.	shakespearean
Poor lady, she’ll run mad When she shall lack it.	shakespearean
Cousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly.	shakespearean
As for me, I welcome my good luck with sadness.	modern
Two of both kinds makes four.	modern
Me too, but still, for the sake of good manners, I’ll say thanks for your company.	modern
This Iago is extremely honest and good, and he knows a lot about human behavior.	modern
Here come two noble beasts in, a man and a lion.	shakespearean
He’s definitely the most active gentleman of France.	modern
And come you now with “knocking at the gate”?	shakespearean
What is my nation?	modern
Calm down, Kate.	modern
Pardon not that.	shakespearean
Give my answer to them both.	modern
I’ve seen you bait and mock this man more than once.	modern
Go on, tell it.	modern
Go, then, mother, to your daughter.	modern
What now, Lucillius?	shakespearean
O perdurable shame!	shakespearean
Everyone who does so is a traitor and should be hanged.	modern
She can’t hurt you, Helena.	modern
Indeed, they say my uncle grew so fast that he could gnaw on a crust of bread when he was two hours old.	modern
Tis strange.	shakespearean
He longs not for the dawning as we do.	shakespearean
Take but good note, and you shall see in him The triple pillar of the world transformed Into a strumpet’s fool.	shakespearean
Then you do not love me?	shakespearean
Art thou the slave that with thy breath hast killed Mine innocent child?	shakespearean
I know they’re in Rome together, hoping for Antony to return.	modern
Good friends, go in and taste some wine with me.	shakespearean
You come not Like Caesar’s sister.	shakespearean
Come, we’ll to sleep.	shakespearean
I am not so well as I should be, but I’ll ne’er out.	shakespearean
Where are Lysander and beautiful Hermia?	modern
My God, what a great song!	modern
Mistake me not.	shakespearean
For Brutus’s sake, I am indebted to you.	modern
Why, horns, which such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for.	shakespearean
I know because I dreamed of money bags last night.	modern
Carry this mad knave to the jail.—Father Baptista, I charge you see that he be forthcoming.	shakespearean
Tomorrow We’ll hear ourselves again.	shakespearean
If you are human, don’t stand for it.	modern
Men may sleep, and they may have their throats about them at that time, and some say knives have edges.	shakespearean
No more, cousin.	shakespearean
Come with me tonight, and you’ll see a man enter her bedroom chamber—even tonight, the night before her wedding.	modern
O cruel!	shakespearean
I might ask you for your commission, but I do take thee, Orlando, for my husband.	shakespearean
Set on, and leave no ceremony out.	shakespearean
And she is mine, and all my right of her I do estate unto Demetrius.	shakespearean
I am a man again.	modern
I am ready for you.	modern
Knowing how much I loved my books, he gave me some books from my library that I value more than my dukedom.	modern

No, don’t hit him, lieutenant!	modern
If each grain of sand had a tongue to eulogize, my horse would be a topic for them all.	modern
You can’t see the future.	modern

Behold, there stand the caskets, noble Prince.	shakespearean
My father charged you in his will to give me good education.	shakespearean
Then tell her my loving story in simple terms.	modern
Oh, the poor man!	modern
You may do then in time.	shakespearean
I dare not confess that lest I should compare with him in excellence, but to know a man well were to know himself.	shakespearean
Stand away, Captain Gower.	shakespearean
My good lord.	shakespearean
If they make you not then the better answer, you may say they are not the men you took them for.	shakespearean
Why aren’t the leaves withering now that the sap is all dried up?	modern
Before she began shedding tears all over her lovely face, she was the fairest creature in the world—and even now she has no equal.	modern
Added to these, Of knights, esquires, and gallant gentlemen, Eight thousand and four hundred, of the which, Five hundred were but yesterday dubbed knights.	shakespearean

Give me my principal, and let me go.	shakespearean
I am famished in his service.	shakespearean
Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this: Brutus had rather be a villager Than to repute himself a son of Rome Under these hard conditions as this time Is like to lay upon us.	shakespearean
I’ll be right here, silent.	modern
Is ’t not enough, is ’t not enough, young man, That I did never, no, nor never can, Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius' eye, But you must flout my insufficiency?	shakespearean
My lord.	shakespearean
You have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting, With most admired disorder.	shakespearean
I pray that God ends his life before I die, so I can say, “The dog is dead!”	modern
Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions?	shakespearean
What can you see out on the ocean?	modern
To seek my uncle in the Forest of Arden.	shakespearean
You, constable, are to present the Prince’s own person.	shakespearean
Oh, eastern star!	modern
He did appoint so.	shakespearean
You might as well do the impossible rather than try to soften his Jewish heart.	modern
It’ll be worth your while.	modern
Remember’st thou any that have died on ’t?	shakespearean
Did not you speak?	shakespearean
All the perfumes of Arabia couldn’t make my little hand smell better.	modern
Who are you talking about?	modern
What’s going on here?	modern
If she do bid me pack, I’ll give her thanks, As though she bid me stay by her a week.	shakespearean
I’m going to find some shade and sigh until he returns.	modern
Why will you mew her up, Signior Baptista, for this fiend of hell And make her bear the penance of her tongue?	shakespearean
I almost die for food, and let me have it.	shakespearean
Gratiano talks more nonsense than any other man in Venice.	modern
Yes, in truth it is, sir.	shakespearean
And of the heat of the ginger.	shakespearean

Yes, your Majesty.	modern
Please, corporal, stop!	modern
I can’t talk about my happiness anymore.	modern

She mocks all her suitors so severely that they drop the suit.	modern
Labio and Flavio, push our armies onward.	modern
Arise, dissembler.	shakespearean
What said Northumberland as touching Richmond?	shakespearean
No, truly.	shakespearean
Yes, my lord.	modern
That’s true, my good boy.—Come on, take us to that hut.	modern

I have done.	shakespearean
If you will take a homely man’s advice, Be not found here.	shakespearean
Well, I have done.	shakespearean
Much castigation, exercise devout, For here’s a young and sweating devil here, That commonly rebels.	shakespearean
I think I can find him.	modern
How strange that they all got so sleepy!	modern
You look pale, and gaze, And put on fear, and cast yourself in wonder To see the strange impatience of the heavens.	shakespearean
My lord, he wonders why you have assembled such troops of citizens to speak with him, since he had no idea they were coming.	modern
Let me gather my wits and get serious here.	modern
Therefore speak no more.	shakespearean
Ay, by heaven, my lord.	shakespearean
In God’s name, I beg you not to wish for one more man.	modern
Go to him, petition him.	modern
My husband lost his life to get the crown, And often up and down my sons were tossed For me to joy, and weep, their gain and loss.	shakespearean
Does that mean he’s lazy?	modern
Take up my mistress' gown to his master’s use!	shakespearean
A good and virtuous nature may recoil In an imperial charge.	shakespearean
Look out, he’s coming!	modern
On me, though I am limping and deformed?	modern
My villainy they have upon record, which I had rather seal with my death than repeat over to my shame.	shakespearean
Give him my respects, and tell him I’ll definitely be there for dinner, since I know he has gone to great lengths for this meal.	modern
I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.	shakespearean
Ensign, what’s he doing in there?	modern
This is most certain that I shall deliver: Mark Antony is every hour in Rome Expected.	shakespearean
Big, round tears ran piteously down the animal’s innocent nose.	modern
Shake off your sleepiness.	modern
That’s how someone who’s been murdered should look, and that’s how I look.	modern
Their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage.	shakespearean
Lo, yonder, and Titinius mourning it.	shakespearean
For I’m sure that although you may know what temperance is, you’ve never experienced it firsthand.	modern
I can’t see ahead of me.	modern
I do beseech your Grace, Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me.	shakespearean
Are you going to start eating worms and flies?	modern
No more but so?	shakespearean
Don’t follow me.	modern
And there is a forerunner come from a fifth, the Prince of Morocco, who brings word the prince his master will be here tonight.	shakespearean
Quick, let’s hide, my lord.	modern
When shall we come to th' top of that same hill?	shakespearean
That’s a nice hat you’ve got there.	modern
Where is Antony?	shakespearean
Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!	shakespearean
Farewell, sir.	modern
Unkindness is powerful, and his unkindness may kill me, but it’ll never destroy my love.	modern
Your heart’s going to break.	modern
Bear him my head.	shakespearean
And as our vineyards, fallows, meads, and hedges, Defective in their natures, grow to wildness, Even so our houses and ourselves and children Have lost, or do not learn for want of time, The sciences that should become our country, But grow like savages, as soldiers will	shakespearean
So that means she’ll come.	modern
Why then, resolve me whether you will or no.	shakespearean
No, he comes to be married  Lady, do you come here to be married to this count?	modern
Thou shalt be pinched As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging Than bees that made 'em.	shakespearean
Or here, or at the Capitol.	shakespearean
This is unbelievable!	modern
I will lay trust upon thee, and thou shalt find a dearer father in my love.	shakespearean
What did you enact?	shakespearean
Cry “holla” to thy tongue, I prithee.	shakespearean
Or any of you?	modern
Oh Iago!	modern
You know, I saw the Duchess of Milan’s gown, the one that everyone praises so highly.	modern
Within this roof The enemy of all your graces lives.	shakespearean
What did he when thou saw’st him?	shakespearean
O, lady, lady, shame would have it hid.	shakespearean
If I can cure him from his fever and tame him, and get him back to Naples, he’d make a great present for any emperor.	modern
Den it sall also content me.	shakespearean
Goodbye, my lord.	modern
According to what I heard, they had no travel plans as of last night.	modern
Even if I had sworn never to marry, I wouldn’t trust myself to keep that promise if Hero would marry me.	modern
The ladies, her attendants of her chamber Saw her abed, and in the morning early They found the bed untreasured of their mistress.	shakespearean
Do tell.	modern
He hath fought today As if a god, in hate of mankind, had Destroyed in such a shape.	shakespearean
Ha, Portia?	shakespearean
Should I do it now?	modern
Is ’t possible?	shakespearean
I’ll hide in the arbor.	modern
What would you with me, honest neighbor?	shakespearean
Isn’t that him heading this way?	modern
Now any effort ruins what it attempts.	modern
Is there any news about my husband?	modern
Hey, Cassio!	modern
By my troth, I speak my thought.	shakespearean
She is never sad but when she sleeps, and not ever sad then, for I have heard my daughter say she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked herself with laughing.	shakespearean
Madam, you’ve given me life and given me a living too.	modern
Thank you very much.	modern
Well, what worst?	shakespearean
I know he would not be a wolf But that he sees the Romans are but sheep.	shakespearean
If I see anything tonight why I should not marry her, tomorrow in the congregation, where I should wed, there will I shame her.	shakespearean
Come, Antonio.	shakespearean
This shepherd boy reminds me quite vividly of my daughter.	modern
So I do.	shakespearean
Make us thy ministers of chastisement, That we may praise thee in the victory!	shakespearean
My men should call me “lord.” I am your goodman.	shakespearean
I hope not.	modern
Oh, this is treachery!	modern
Take each man’s censure but reserve thy judgment.	shakespearean
Has it been decided that Richard will be  It’s been decided, though not yet officially announced.	modern
What news do you bring?	modern
Signor Benedick!	shakespearean
He deserves it, even if it were covered with jewels like holy	modern
Your reason?	shakespearean
Is the king leaving here today?	modern
In the meantime, be patient.	modern
Well, I think it’s good to be serious and keep quiet.	modern
The meat was fine if you wanted to eat it.	modern
The skin is good for your broken coxcomb.	shakespearean
We were somewhere where I couldn’t pick a fight with him, but I’ve decided to wear it in my cap until I see him again, whereupon I’ll give him a little piece of my mind.	modern
I can see a church by daylight.	shakespearean
Count, take of me my daughter, and with her my fortunes.	shakespearean
Come now, keep thine oath.	shakespearean
And, Demetrius, The more you beat me, I will fawn on you.	shakespearean
My noble lord— What is it, Iago?	modern
Ever since you lost yours.	modern
In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words.	shakespearean
Brutus will lead, and we’ll follow him with the boldest and best hearts of Rome.	modern
If you choose the one that contains my picture, we’ll be married right away.	modern
The bounty and the benison of heaven To boot and boot.	shakespearean
Was a man ever beaten as much as me?	modern
Sir, I never loved you much, but I ha’ praised ye When you have well deserved ten times as much As I have said you did.	shakespearean
I wish it were day!	modern
Are you acting so boldly from hardship or because you despise good manners?	modern
And when she is peevish and perverse, sullen, sour, and disobedient to his honest wishes, what is she but a loathsome, warlike rebel and an ungrateful traitor to her loving lord?	modern
Poor Tom hath been scared out of his good wits.	shakespearean
But it is certain I am loved of all ladies, only you excepted.	shakespearean
I have slept, my lord, already.	shakespearean
This is what happened: he and Cleopatra sat on chairs of gold on a silver-covered stage in the marketplace.	modern
Oh, what a villain I am!	modern
Some good man bear him carefully from hence.	shakespearean
I’ve never seen him like this.	modern
Part them!	shakespearean
Absolutely not.	modern
I’ll bring you to him right away.	modern
This, Casca.	shakespearean
I fear no uncles dead.	shakespearean
But how long shall that title “ever” last?	shakespearean
Moreover, out of mercy, the Constable urges you to remind your men to make their peace with God and repent, so that their souls may depart sweetly and peacefully from these fields where, poor wretches, their bodies will likely fall and fester.	modern
He replied, “Thou unpossessing bastard!	shakespearean
A very nasty meaning.	modern
Say, have I thy consent that they shall die?	shakespearean
Then follow me and listen to my speech, friends.	modern
It wearies me; you say it wearies you.	shakespearean
No, you’ll have to excuse me.	modern
Saw you my lord?	shakespearean
Then die and be damned!	modern
I can confirm that all these shocking things are true.	modern
But if I give my wife a handkerchief— What then?	shakespearean
Was there ever a match put together so quickly?	modern
That’s why you sleep so soundly.	modern
As a child, he took such a long time to grow up that, according to his rule, he should have grown up into a gracious adult.	modern
You’re stripped of your power and your command, and Cassio will govern Cyprus.	modern
And the best of me is diligence.	shakespearean
You’re smart, though, and if you were sick, you’d take what you needed to get better.	modern
Go ahead, but I won’t listen.	modern
What are you?	shakespearean
Since the youth won’t be reasoned with, he’ll have to suffer for his stubbornness.	modern
And like I am for no woman.	modern
If our eyes were policemen, they might capture two thieves at once while we’re embracing.	modern
Go show your slaves how choleric you are And make your bondmen tremble.	shakespearean
Richard has set boundaries between my love and theirs?	modern
O sir, fly this place.	shakespearean
Fare you well.	shakespearean
Is he in his royal garments?	modern
This lantern represents the moon.	modern
For the heavens, he shows me where the bachelors sit, and there live we as merry as the day is long.	shakespearean
Will you go?	shakespearean
Heaven knows.	modern
Very foul.	shakespearean
Pray well, father.	modern
Not that we love words more than fighting, like you do.	modern
It’s nearly dinner time, and the night’s going to be wasted.	modern
Why, right, you are in the right.	shakespearean
But all of you, remember what you’ve said and prove yourselves true Romans.	modern
By th' clock ’tis day, And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp.	shakespearean
See, they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks.	shakespearean
Silvius, tell this youth what it means to be in love.	modern
I remember thine eyes well enough.	shakespearean
Think not I love him, though I ask for him.	shakespearean
If you hadn’t shown up on cue, my lord, Lord Hastings was going to take your part—I mean, he was going to speak for you—in the crowning of the king.	modern
I’ll show thee the best springs.	shakespearean
Lie they upon thy hand And be undone by ’em!	shakespearean
What, has his daughters brought him to this pass?— Couldst thou save nothing?	shakespearean
Everyone can see that, and even blind men can smell the stench of his misery now.	modern
Bring here The gentleman who advised you To give away your land.	modern
But if you conspired against my position while you were there, I might be interested in the reason for your stay in Egypt.	modern
You are all most welcome here; please make yourselves at home.	modern
They murder Caesar!”—Who’s within?	shakespearean
Who’s shouting?	modern
Show your slaves how mad you are, and make your servants tremble.	modern
Had it th' ability of life to thank you.	shakespearean
Dost thou lie still?	shakespearean
You’ll be sorry later, but it’ll be too late.	modern
There’s no bravery in an unfair fight.	modern
Wasn’t he born from a woman?	modern
As you are old and reverend, should be wise.	shakespearean
Iago’s a good man.	modern
An I had been a man of any occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word, I would I might go to hell among the rogues.	shakespearean
If she and I are happy, what’s it to you?	modern
It was a bit short, my lord.	modern
This hasn’t reached the level of an Egyptian feast yet.	modern
There attend my coming.	shakespearean
If he be, he knows how to turn his girdle.	shakespearean
We have not yet set the coronation day.	modern
Come, come, you froward and unable worms!	shakespearean
This is pure insanity.	modern
Greetings, good general!	modern
I don’t	modern
Meet me by and by at the citadel.	shakespearean
Looking just like the dead king.	modern
There must be some resolution.	modern
This wedding day Perhaps is but prolonged.	shakespearean
You have guessed exactly what I feared.	modern
Oh, my brave Emperor, this is what I call a fight!	modern
We have to be married properly.	modern
I won’t speak to her.	modern
Hence, saucy eunuch!	shakespearean
Let’s take leave of him.	shakespearean
That they were, I wish Myself were mudded in that oozy bed Where my son lies.—When did you lose your daughter?	shakespearean
You jig and amble, and you lisp, you nickname God’s creatures and make your wantonness your ignorance.	shakespearean
My lord, he’s going to his mother’s closet.	shakespearean
Sir, my brother is very fond of you.	modern
Good morning, neighbor Baptista.	modern
Now my spells are all broken, And the only power I have is my own, Which is very weak.	modern
I shouldn’t make you do more than you’re able.	modern
For eighty-one weeks he will waste away in agony.	modern
Noble Antony, even illness couldn’t keep me away.	modern
Too bad it’s spoiling our pleasure tonight.	modern
Name the day of marriage, and God give thee joy.	shakespearean
Here do I choose, and thrive I as I may!	shakespearean
No, no, forsooth, I dare not for my life.	shakespearean
So, good-bye.	modern
Know’st thou not any whom corrupting gold Will tempt unto a close exploit of death?	shakespearean
Come, in what key shall a man take you to go in the song?	shakespearean
Now, tell me—which of my bad qualities did you fall in love with first?	modern
Talk to the ambassadors who’ve just come back: ask them how majestically he responded to their message, how well supplied he was with good advisors, how restrained in expressing his displeasure, and, moreover, how terrifyingly firm he was in his resolve.	modern
The marshal of France, Monsieur la Far.	modern
I wish we had a signed legal contract.	modern
What news?	shakespearean
There’s nothing else.	modern
I am not drunk now.	shakespearean
Therefore, out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you withal, that either you might stay him from his intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into, in that it is a thing of his own search and altogether against my will.	shakespearean
I’ll do everything a younger man could do for you.	modern
Just remember who you’ve got on board with you, good man.	modern
Portia, what mean you?	shakespearean
I’ll signify so much unto him straight.	shakespearean
I’m speaking for the king, but I look like myself.	modern
So, tell us, did you see that thing again tonight?	modern
Our present business Is to general woe.	shakespearean
You can trust me.	modern
Their shadows are like a deadly canopy, under which our army lies, ready to die.	modern
Sure, ’tis not so.	shakespearean
O slanderous world!	shakespearean
Is there anything else I can do for you?	modern
Oh, I can buy twenty husbands at any market.	modern
Are you so gospeled To pray for this good man and for his issue, Whose heavy hand hath bowed you to the grave And beggared yours forever?	shakespearean
But as all is mortal in nature, so is all nature in love mortal in folly.	shakespearean
First, I must tell thee this: Desdemona is directly in love with him.	shakespearean
Thou troublest me; I am not in the vein.	shakespearean
You’ve said it well.	modern
You don’t think you can teach her?	modern
Come, brands, ho, firebrands.	shakespearean
This will put them out of fear.	shakespearean
I’ll have my bond, and therefore speak no more.	shakespearean
At least two hours past.	modern
Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my fortune, Why strew’st thou sugar on that bottled spider, Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?	shakespearean
None of these rogues and cowards But Ajax is their fool.	shakespearean
Believe me, then, that I have special powers.	modern
From the highest to the lowest of you, I bid you a hearty welcome.	modern
Swear your love.	shakespearean
Certainly not!	modern
In that case it’s your imagination that’s interesting, not the play.	modern
I swear, she’s a very good-natured lady.	modern
If I have killed the issue of your womb, To quicken your increase I will beget Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter.	shakespearean
Good morning, gentlemen.	modern
The Turks are heading for Cyprus with a powerful fleet.	modern
Did you go to bed so late, my friend, that you’re having a hard time getting up now?	modern
I pray thee, tell me then that he is well.	shakespearean
I put those wedding sheets on your bed, as you asked.	modern
You’d better bring the messenger safely through the lines so he can return.	modern
That you should here repent you, The actors are at hand, and by their show You shall know all that you are like to know.	shakespearean
It cannot be.	shakespearean
Don’t you know that I’m a woman?	modern
Ay, sir, it is too true, God help the while.	shakespearean
Away, then!	shakespearean
You always know he’s got some plan that pleases him when he says good morning with such gusto.	modern
One way I like this well.	shakespearean
But there where I have garnered up my heart, Where either I must live or bear no life, The fountain from the which my current runs Or else dries up—to be discarded thence!	shakespearean
The blow thou hadst Shall make thy peace for moving me to rage, And I will boot thee with what gift beside Thy modesty can beg.	shakespearean
Here is more of us.	shakespearean
My father and mother coupled when the demonic moon was descending, and I was born under the Big Dipper, so it’s inevitable that I’m rude and oversexed.	modern
I found you as a morsel cold upon Dead Caesar’s trencher.	shakespearean
Strangle her in her bed, even the bed she hath contaminated.	shakespearean
But if it overwhelms you to look at Caesar’s wounded cloak, how will you feel, kind men, now?	modern
To do thus I learned of thee.	shakespearean
That’s not the tune.	shakespearean
And as I say, retire with me to my lodging, from whence I will fitly bring you to hear my lord speak.	shakespearean
In his greatest need, even they will desert him.	modern
And for my means, I’ll husband them so well, They shall go far with little.	shakespearean
Who is ’t that hinders you?	shakespearean
It’s time for me to say goodbye to you.	modern
children have lost—or no longer have time to learn—skills that should be a credit to our country.	modern
Well, I conceive.	shakespearean
I know who you are.	modern
Watch me: stroke your chins and swear by your beards that I am a knave.	modern
I wonder at it.	shakespearean
Her eyes are fierce, but thine Do comfort and not burn.	shakespearean
Destiny chooses when you’ll die and who you’ll marry.	modern
They say there’s but five upon this isle.	shakespearean
Oh, that devious Egyptian spirit!	modern
First let’s go to dinner.	modern
No, uncle, but our crosses on the way Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy.	shakespearean
You’ll just have to be patient for a little while.	modern
No one’s listening to you.	modern
Please, sir, don’t trouble yourself.	modern
Stop fooling around.	modern
That they lack, for if their heads had any intellectual armor, they could never wear such heavy head-pieces.	shakespearean
Oh, please let me.	modern
Mistress, you have to go see your father.	modern
Oh, sir, pardon me!	modern
Stand close and list him.	shakespearean
And I.	shakespearean
Everybody may do as they please until seven o'clock tonight.	modern
A flatterer’s would not, though they do appear As huge as high Olympus.	shakespearean
Well, time will tell.	modern
If I’m a wasp, look out for my stinger.	modern
Michael Cassio, lieutenant of the Moor Othello, has arrived on shore.	modern
Six pence a day would’ve been forced on him.	modern
There’s no doubt his majesty Will soon recover his accustomed health.	shakespearean
Well, I know not What counts harsh Fortune casts upon my face, But in my bosom shall she never come To make my heart her vassal.	shakespearean
What do you want, fellow?	modern
Was that the Caius Cassius that I knew?	modern
How answer you for yourselves?	shakespearean
Not in love neither?	shakespearean
I’ll recognize him all right, I’m sure of it.	modern
The empire may be in danger if he’s not restrained before he reaches his full potential.	modern
I thank you; and be blessed for your good comfort.	shakespearean
You tell her, widow!	modern
Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen, And now I find report a very liar.	shakespearean
Miranda.—O my father, I have broke your hest to say so!	shakespearean
I serve the king, who sent me here.	modern
I' faith, I thank him.	shakespearean
Nothing that you want to hear, my lord, but nothing so bad that I can’t mention it.	modern
Goes the king hence today?	shakespearean
Kate like the hazel-twig Is straight and slender and as brown in hue As hazel nuts, and sweeter than the kernels.	shakespearean
No, who are you talking about?	modern
If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good a heart as I can bid the other four farewell, I should be glad of his approach.	shakespearean
She has light by her continually.	shakespearean
I’m serious, I can’t.	modern
If haply you my father do suspect An instrument of this your calling back, Lay not your blame on me.	shakespearean
Yes, my lord.	modern
Your servants are waiting.	modern
Don’t talk to me, Emilia.	modern
How comes it?	shakespearean
First, I ask thee what they have done; thirdly, I ask thee what’s their offense; sixth and lastly, why they are committed; and, to conclude, what you lay to their charge.	shakespearean
Why don’t you answer me, man?	modern
Then is courtesy a turncoat.	shakespearean
You’re acting like an ass, don’t you think?	modern
If he doesn’t like it, he can go live with my sister.	modern
But, let me see, by ten We shall have each a hundred Englishmen.	shakespearean
Come, I’ll go in with you.	shakespearean
Oh, heaven forgive us!	shakespearean
A man’s virtues will always show themselves, and that’s the end of that.	modern
Women, dress me like a queen.	modern
Now I realize your brother tried to kill your father not just because your brother is an evil man, but because your father deserved it by being wicked himself.	modern
Farewell, my lords.	shakespearean
I don’t trust you.	modern
I’m Trinculo—don’t be scared—your good friend Trinculo.	modern
With all my heart, Phoebe.	modern
The meat was well, if you were so contented.	shakespearean
You English princes all, I do salute you.	shakespearean
Well, when I cut the egg in half and eat the whites, the yolk will be in two parts like two golden crowns.	modern
I would sing my song without a burden.	shakespearean
Never king of England Had nobles richer, and more loyal subjects, Whose hearts have left their bodies here in England And lie pavilioned in the fields of France.	shakespearean
Tomorrow, as he purposes.	shakespearean
Aren’t these woods less perilous than the court, with all its jealousies and intrigues?	modern
I do remember in this shepherd boy Some lively touches of my daughter’s favor.	shakespearean
So, goodbye.	modern
And who are you, good sir?	modern
I hope with all my heart she will!	modern
You’re afraid of the boar but you go around without your spear?	modern
I swear on my honor that we saw and heard Hero talking to a brute at her window last night.	modern
I will deny thee nothing!	shakespearean
Indeed, the French may lay twenty French crowns to one they will beat us, for they bear them on their shoulders.	shakespearean
So well thy words become thee as thy wounds; They smack of honor both.	shakespearean
Some should go to the public platforms and cry out, “Liberty, freedom, and democracy!” People and senators, don’t be afraid.	modern
I have stayed for thee, God knows, in torment and in agony.	shakespearean
Is Caesar visiting the Capitol tomorrow?	modern
I am not married, Caesar.	shakespearean
They are then excused, my lord, when they see not what they do.	shakespearean
That’s the truth.	modern
And though his feelings may be pitched higher than ours, when they plummet, they plummet that much farther.	modern
This last course here is for closing up the stomach after great feasting.	modern
If he break the peace, he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling.	shakespearean
You gentle Romans—     Peace, ho!	shakespearean
Tis with cares.	shakespearean
Well, aren’t you a good man?	modern
Then God be blessed, it is the blessèd sun.	shakespearean
God be wi' you, princes all.	shakespearean
He recognizes me like a blind man recognizes a cuckoo—by its bad voice.	modern
Her eyes are vicious, but yours are comforting.	modern
Let our reciprocal vows be remembered.	shakespearean
I won’t be kind to you.	modern
I just saw your father the Lord Gloucester and notified him that the Duke of Cornwall and his wife Regan will stay with him here tonight.	modern
Oh, farewell!	shakespearean
If I could pray to move, prayers would move me.	shakespearean
Show me the caskets and let me try my luck.	modern
Tis heavy night, These may be counterfeits.	shakespearean
Well then, you have good reason to be sad.	modern
Oh, If you but knew how you the purpose cherish Whiles thus you mock it!	shakespearean
Yes, for new lovers time passes ten times faster than for couples who’ve been married forever.	modern
Did he treat you well when you saw him?	modern
What is it, Biondello?	modern
Almost afraid to know itself.	shakespearean
How are you and your master getting along?	modern
I’ll sleep here until morning.	modern
Twas a shame no less Than was his loss, to course your flying flags And leave his navy gazing.	shakespearean
I heard Octavius say that Brutus and Cassius have ridden like madmen through the gates of Rome.	modern
Please, my lord, call her back.	modern
What, is the fellow mad?	shakespearean
Give me your hands if we be friends,  And Robin shall restore amends.	shakespearean
And bring the ship’s captain to the castle.	modern
I can put him in the right mood, and I’ll bring him to the Capitol.	modern
Can a good thing hide itself?	modern
As I neglected practical matters, being totally dedicated to solitude and to improving my mind with subjects more valuable than most people imagine, I was so shut away from the world that I unwittingly stirred up evil wishes in my disloyal brother.	modern
If God will be revenged for this deed, he will do it publicly.	modern
You can refuse to make me your spouse, but I’ll be your servant whether you want me to or not.	modern
There is much to be learned from these converts.	modern
Look how politely it’s pointing you to a place that’s farther away.	modern
Since he went from Egypt ’tis A space for farther travel.	shakespearean
How if they will not?	shakespearean
Your crown’s awry.	shakespearean
Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better than I, where would you choose it?	shakespearean
If you like what you see of the land, the profit that’s possible, and this rustic life, I’ll be your faithful servant, and buy the place with your gold right away.	modern
Striving to better, oft we mar what’s well.	shakespearean
I’ll be getting my own figures together in the meantime.	modern
I saw Bassanio sail away, and Gratiano went with him.	modern
It is the greatest admiration in the universal world when the true and aunchient prerogatifes and laws of the wars is not kept.	shakespearean
But let me see, by ten we shall each have captured a hundred Englishmen.	modern
A pound of human flesh taken isn’t even as valuable as a pound of mutton or beef.	modern
Sir, is everyone in your family at home?	modern
How is ’t, my noble lord?	shakespearean
Do you know me?	modern
Heaven help her!—Get him out of here for now.	modern
O, no!	shakespearean
Join your witchcraft with your beauty, and let Antony’s lust combine with both.	modern
He’s not sick, my lord, but he’s very upset, and his problems are serious.	modern
What do you mean, your highness?	modern
We came crying hither.	shakespearean
Your name, I pray you, friend?	shakespearean
Thou shalt be lord of it and I’ll serve thee.	shakespearean
Before he leaves this part of the forest, you’ll change places: you’ll be the one running away, and he’ll be in love with you.	modern
I thought so then, I’ll kill myself for grief.	shakespearean
Tomorrow will it please you to be crowned?	shakespearean
I hereby grant your request, and hope you have a good time.	modern
Wasn’t that Cassio leaving my wife?	modern
Show me the place.	shakespearean
That will I.	shakespearean
Most monsterlike be shown For poor’st diminutives, for dolts, and let Patient Octavia plow thy visage up With her preparèd nails!	shakespearean
Oh, these fools!	modern
What a fearful night is this!	shakespearean
My lord, the mayor of London comes to greet you.	shakespearean
And then throw the seeds in the sea, to make more islands grow.	modern
Yes, a little too sweet.	modern
Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing?	shakespearean
Oh, this false soul of Egypt!	shakespearean
Leave him to my displeasure.—Edmund, keep you our sister company.	shakespearean
Methinks I should know you, and know this man.	shakespearean
I am that merry wanderer of the night.	shakespearean
Yes, I do, lady.	modern
He came too late.	shakespearean
There’s few or none will entertain it.	shakespearean
You shall not choose but drink before you go.	shakespearean
I bet it will.	modern
Tie up his withered old arms.	modern
Ugly, wrinkled witch, what are you doing here?	modern
Why is the Jew waiting?	modern
Would he deny his letter, said he?	shakespearean
I have heard Your grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify His rigorous course.	shakespearean
Do what he says, William.	modern
I remember him well, and my memory tells me that he deserves your praise.	modern
Even when you please, since you will have it so.	shakespearean
Winter garments must be lined, So must slender Rosalind.	shakespearean
How are you doing?	modern
There is no indication of the mighty army that surrounds them in his expression, nor has the long, sleepless night robbed his face of an ounce of color.	modern
Well then, don’t bother.	modern
Won’t King Richard let me speak with him?	modern
That’s right, except for the widow Dido.	modern
They fell together all, as by consent.	shakespearean
Run away, I pray you!	shakespearean
We are three of them.	shakespearean
Just as Antony loves.	modern
What is that bloody knife?	modern
We won’t hold back any of our wisdom.	modern
Madam, hurry as fast as you can get out of my court.	modern
Any minute.	modern
O Lord, my lord, if they were but a week married, they would talk themselves mad.	shakespearean
How do you know he loves her?	modern
Come on, let’s get to the banquet.	modern
Will money buy 'em?	shakespearean
Yet touch this sparingly, as ’twere far off, Because, my lord, you know my mother lives.	shakespearean
Speak, hands, for me!	shakespearean
But, on: six Barbary horses against six French swords, their assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages—that’s the French bet against the Danish.	shakespearean
I serve the king, On whose employment I was sent to you.	shakespearean
You and I have heard our fathers talk of another Brutus—your ancestor—who would’ve let the devil himself reign in his Roman Republic before he let a king rule.	modern
No, he was wicked and vile.	modern
How, my lord, I may be censured, that nature thus gives way to loyalty, something fears me to think of.	shakespearean
It’s nobler to leap in ourselves than dawdle until they push us.	modern
So I, being young, till now ripe not to reason.	shakespearean
But chiefly Him that you termed, sir, “the good old Lord Gonzalo,” His tears run down his beard like winter’s drops From eaves of reeds.	shakespearean
Their villainy nauseates me, and I must therefore vomit it up.	modern
Or shall I say her uncle?	shakespearean
So the life that died with shame Lives on with fame.	modern
You are nothing like Mark Antony!	modern
We’ll see you tomorrow.	modern
Some there be that shadows kiss.	shakespearean
Good day, Catesby.	modern
You know tomorrow is the wedding day.	shakespearean
I’m here, full of anger, to complain about my daughter Hermia.—Step forward, Demetrius.—My lord, this man, Demetrius, has my permission to marry her.—Step forward, Lysander.—But this other man, Lysander, has cast a magic spell over my child’s heart.—You, you, Lysander, you’ve given her poems, and exchanged tokens of love with my daughter.	modern
Speak thou now.	shakespearean
The armies were like two exhausted swimmers clinging to each other and struggling in the water, unable to move.	modern
Ha, ha, ha!	modern
More, please, more.	modern
Hence, Mardian, And bring me how he takes my death.	shakespearean
You’ve seen these illusions.	modern
No, I won’t give my medicine away to anyone but the sick.	modern
But no beautiful woman has an honest face.	modern
Had I your tongues and eyes, I’d use them so That heaven’s vault should crack.	shakespearean
A velvet dish!	shakespearean
I’ve already slept, my lord.	modern
This done, he took the bride about the neck And kissed her lips with such a clamorous smack That at the parting all the church did echo.	shakespearean
The best?	shakespearean
They clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrase Soil our addition.	shakespearean
Soldier, why are you wearing that glove in your cap?	modern
But this storm in my mind keeps me from feeling anything except what’s tormenting me—how ungrateful my children are!	modern
It’s certain.	modern
He sent me word if I said his beard was not cut well, he was in the mind it was.	shakespearean
One more thing, good gentlemen.	modern
It’s easy to err when left to our own devices, but criticism helps us to see our faults and correct them.	modern
Now, Iras, what do you think?	modern
I’d rather have lost my legs in battle than be a part of this!	modern
Though it pass your patience and mine to endure her loud alarums, why, man, there be good fellows in the world, an a man could light on them, would take her with all faults, and money enough.	shakespearean
Well then, tomorrow night, or Tuesday morning.	modern
Then there’s life in ’t.	shakespearean
My lady, with your permission, this note authorizes me to give myself to you with a kiss.	modern
And if he advances unopposed, my lord, let us abandon France.	modern
No, if they try to lead us to harm, I will leave the dance floor at the next song.	modern
Don’t hurt me.	modern
Enobarbus, Antony Hath after thee sent all thy treasure, with His bounty overplus.	shakespearean
He’s been captured or killed.	modern
I hope he’s grown a lot since I last saw him.	modern
Madam, with all my heart.	shakespearean
Nor hath Love’s mind of any judgment taste— Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste.	shakespearean
No one should have an honor he doesn’t deserve.	modern
I came here crying.	modern
How tall is she?	modern
Here’s the manner of ’t: I’ th’ marketplace, on a tribunal silvered, Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold Were publicly enthroned.	shakespearean
Follow his chariot, like the greatest disgrace to your whole gender.	modern
I am dying, Egypt, dying.	shakespearean
If I were your average fool, or if I made my feelings for you worthless by making the same promises of friendship to everybody, or if you’d seen me first flattering men, hugging them tightly, and later slandering them behind their backs, or if you hear that I drunkenly declare friendship at banquets with all the rabble, only then, of course, go ahead and assume I’m dangerous.	modern
I became his guide, I led him and begged for him, and kept him from suicide.	modern
Let’s take a little walk in the orchard before dinner.	modern
The queen your mother is upset, and sent me to see you.	modern
By this sword” is an oath, and oaths must be kept.	modern
Oh, if you only knew how close to success you are, even while you make fun of what I’m telling you!	modern
What, thou?	shakespearean
A thin face, which you don’t have; a sleepless, sunken eye, which you don’t have; an irritable temper, which you don’t have; a neglected beard, which you don’t have—but that might not be so telling, since you don’t have much beard anyway.	modern
The Queen shall then have courtesy, so she Will yield us up?	shakespearean
Sir, a whole history.	shakespearean
Here’s someone coming in his pajamas, with a candle and weapons.	modern
How awful!	modern
I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace, and it better fits my blood to be disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob love from any.	shakespearean
Who’s there?	shakespearean
Go, go, up to the leads.	shakespearean
Though their injunction be to bar my doors And let this tyrannous night take hold upon you, Yet have I ventured to come seek you out And bring you where both fire and food is ready.	shakespearean
It now draws toward night.	shakespearean
Now, tailor, let’s see what you’ve got.	modern
No more talk about my father; you’ll be whipped for slander one of these days.	modern
The warships have sent a dozen messages tonight, one after the other, and many of the senators have been awakened and are at the Duke’s already.	modern
When I have the juice of that flower, I’ll trickle some drops of it on Titania’s eyes while she’s sleeping.	modern
It’s true, my lords, he did.	modern
Approach and speak.	shakespearean
Too long a pause for that which you find there.	shakespearean
Are the others waiting?	modern
He was dressed so oddly too!	modern
It is a reeling world indeed, my lord, And I believe will never stand upright Till Richard wear the garland of the realm.	shakespearean
The more she	modern
Simple, plain Clarence, I do love thee so That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven, If heaven will take the present at our hands.	shakespearean
I hope you’ll be a good father to me now.	modern
Enough to buy everything you have declared.	modern
So be gone.	shakespearean
I’ll kill myself to save myself from slavery.	modern
What bloody man is that?	shakespearean
Now I’m alone.	modern
I’ll fume with them!” And with that word she struck me on the head, And through the instrument my pate made way,	shakespearean
At Crosby Place, there shall you find us both.	shakespearean
Who are you, slave?	modern
I will perform this ceremony every year.	modern
That’s what I intend to do too.	modern
What then, sick?	modern
I’m coming, I’m coming!	modern
I’ll never see my gold again.	modern
O monstrous world!	shakespearean
The brave experience death only once.	modern
I know the man a bit.	modern
This haunting business is even stranger than murder.	modern
I have a lot to do before noon.	modern
You shall be more beloving than beloved.	shakespearean
And what of all this?	modern
I frown at him, but he still loves me.	modern
Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem.	shakespearean
Come here, you.	modern
Someone who was always near you.	modern
No, you shall pardon me.	shakespearean
Some of them will fall tomorrow, I hope.	shakespearean
You told me they escaped into this forest.	modern
At your kind’st leisure.	shakespearean
The lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard.	shakespearean
When thou dost ask me blessing, I’ll kneel down And ask of thee forgiveness.	shakespearean
I know how they think, and I understand why they’re doing this.	modern
Yes, truly, for look you, the sins of the father are to be laid upon the children.	shakespearean
He should imprison the person who named you, instead.	modern
It’s a big prize for such a small sin.	modern
You’d better shut up!	modern
Chid I for that at frugal Nature’s frame?	shakespearean
Will you know them then?	shakespearean
Most heathenish and most gross!	shakespearean
If there be any good thing to be done That may to thee do ease and grace to me, Speak to me.	shakespearean
Excuse me, my lord?	modern
Let her be thine, for we Have no such daughter, nor shall ever see That face of hers again.	shakespearean
Caesar, I shall.	shakespearean
I have had four quarrels, and like to have fought one.	shakespearean
I attend them with all respect and duty.	shakespearean
Do you not hear him?	shakespearean
To have no man come over me!	shakespearean
Tis they have put him on the old man’s death, To have th' expense and spoil of his revenues.	shakespearean
He’s asking him to tell the story again.	modern
You shouldn’t have to see the punishment we inflict on your father.	modern
I do not see them bleed.	shakespearean
Your father got excellent husbands, if a maid could come by them.	shakespearean
I did.	modern
Only give me leave, Unworthy as I am, to follow you.	shakespearean
O, then be bold to say Bassanio’s dead!	shakespearean
And now that I have the boy, I’ll undo the spell that makes her vision so disgustingly wrong.	modern
Come, shall I make you two friends?	shakespearean
It’s cheap and nasty!	modern
Either let heaven send lightning to strike the murderer dead or let the earth open wide and devour him, as it does this good king’s blood.	modern
Welcome, Iago.	shakespearean
This is a man—old, wrinkled, faded, withered— And not a maiden, as thou say’st he is.	shakespearean
Give me leave.— I am a gentleman of Verona, sir, That hearing of her beauty and her wit, Her affability and bashful modesty, Her wondrous qualities and mild behavior, Am bold to show myself a forward guest Within your house, to make mine eye the witness Of that report which I so oft have heard.	shakespearean
Canidius, Our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land, And our twelve thousand horse.	shakespearean
Carry him gently to bed, and every man be ready at his post when he awakes.	modern
Who is ’t that cried?	shakespearean
There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee.	shakespearean
I’m not going to be bothered by you for long.	modern
I’ve told you.	modern
The sooner, sweet, for you.	shakespearean
I have a journey, sir, shortly to go.	shakespearean
I must go attend Caesar.	modern
And what wilt thou do—beg when that is spent?	shakespearean
The gods can hear you lying!	modern
Madam, here comes my lord.	shakespearean
Keep my cups full and treat me as you did when my empire was one of your fellow servants, obeying my commands.	modern
How does it feel to be Benedick the Married Man?	modern
Tell him to greet the king of England with our sharp defiance.	modern
Where is our usual manager of mirth?	shakespearean
If you won’t leave, then	modern
Stanley, look to your wife.	shakespearean
He will if he lives long enough to become a man.	modern
Yes, let’s go to sleep.	modern
He ran to his house, stunned.	modern
Fie, what a question’s that If thou wert near a lewd interpreter!	shakespearean
Do you believe his “offers,” as you call them?	modern
What business is it of yours?—Father, be quiet.	modern
What trade, boy?	modern
If you leave like that, you tell the world that it’s not worthy of a good-bye.	modern
And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not.	shakespearean
This is a majestic and harmonious vision.	modern
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail And you are stayed for.	shakespearean
Send him but hither and I’ll fashion him.	shakespearean
Speak, my fair, and fairly, I pray thee.	shakespearean
Those that have known the earth so full of faults.	shakespearean
I see a woman may be made a fool of if she doesn’t have nerve enough to stand up for herself.	modern
No, it’s just after twelve; I heard the clock strike.	modern
Fear not, Baptista, we will content you.	shakespearean
If not, your pardon and my return shall be the end of my business.	shakespearean
We’ll have supper in the morning.	modern
The fault’s your own.	shakespearean
Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears.	shakespearean
Shall not be long but I’ll be here again.	shakespearean
Ay, my good lord.	shakespearean
The transgression is in the stealer.	shakespearean
And those eyes were endowed with sight by Claudio, the Prince, and me.	modern
Let me, if not by birth, have lands by wit.	shakespearean
Your slander has broken her heart, and now she lies buried with her ancestors in a tomb—ancestors who had never been tainted by scandal until you caused one with your wickedness.	modern
And when she put it on, she made me vow That I should neither sell nor give nor lose it.	shakespearean
Tis paltry to be Caesar.	shakespearean
We need a calendar!	modern
The hour of death is expiate.	shakespearean
Lovers, make moan.	shakespearean
And must they all be hanged that swear and lie?	shakespearean
It’s nothing.	modern
Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful.	shakespearean
Then get to work, poison!	modern
O God, your only jig-maker.	shakespearean
Why, the hot-blooded France that dowerless took Our youngest born—I could as well be brought To knee his throne, and, squirelike, pension beg To keep base life afoot.	shakespearean
Have my brother-in-law’s troops been mobilized?	modern
Your husband knew about everything.	modern
I hope poisonous swampy fog covers her face and ruins her complexion!	modern
Ay, to me.	shakespearean
I’ll see them safely married first and then hurry back to my master’s.	modern
Who are the actors?	modern
At seventeen years, many their fortunes seek, But at fourscore, it is too late a week.	shakespearean
The senate has decided to give mighty Caesar a crown today.	modern
To what base uses we may return, Horatio.	shakespearean
And I’ll be eternally grateful to you.	modern
Statilius showed the torchlight but, my lord, He came not back.	shakespearean
He stole it from me.	modern
Tomorrow with your earliest Let me have speech with you.— Come, my dear love, The purchase made, the fruits are to ensue: That profit’s yet to come ’tween me and you.	shakespearean
If he stays in this country he’ll be found.	modern
As you on him, Demetrius dote on you!	shakespearean
As long as hell and Richard want it.	modern
Trinculo, run into no further danger.	shakespearean
And I see you survived your time in Egypt.	modern
My God, they’ve given me a lot to drink.	modern
Will you grant with me That Ferdinand is drowned?	shakespearean
Is it not like the king?	shakespearean
Did he live now,	shakespearean
And it’s too bad that the Moor chose a man with such a deep-rooted drinking problem as his second-in-command.	modern
If she offers him her love, it’s very possible that he’ll scorn it, since, as we all know, he tends to be contemptuous.	modern
For I can give his humor the true bent, And I will bring him to the Capitol.	shakespearean
How horrible!	modern
Yet hear me, countrymen.	shakespearean
But I do prophesy the election lights On Fortinbras.	shakespearean
Why, that’s my dainty Ariel.	shakespearean
Your shoes is not so good.	shakespearean
Please treat my babies well.	modern
I need not to be ashamed of your Majesty, praised be God, so long as your Majesty is an honest man.	shakespearean
What noise is this?—Not dead?	shakespearean
Tarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee, For in Baptista’s keep my treasure is.	shakespearean
I gave him the stuff.	shakespearean
I swear I will never break this promise of love.	modern
Thou art a fool.	shakespearean
Oh, that’s not true, my lord.	modern
Pardon us, dear father.	modern
And begged he pardon?	shakespearean
There’s hope in ’t yet.	shakespearean
And tonight, sir, I invite you have dinner with me.	modern
I will have none on ’t.	shakespearean
Check on your daughter, your house, your money!	modern
They mean this night in Sardis to be quartered.	shakespearean
We’ll probably witness many more outbursts from him, like banishing Kent.	modern
Not at all, Touchstone.	modern
They have not been commanded, mighty king.	shakespearean
Sir, you and I must part, but that’s not it.	shakespearean
I do, in fact.	modern
And that which spites me more than all these wants, He does it under name of perfect love, As who should say, if I should sleep or eat, 'Twere deadly sickness or else present death.	shakespearean
You have to read us the will, Caesar’s will.	modern
If you want to read it, as I haven’t heard it yet, though I’ve heard too much of Phoebe’s cruelty.	modern
With naught but truth.	shakespearean
Watch out, boy—remember I can whip you.	modern
Good madam, restrain yourself.	modern
But ships are but boards, sailors but men.	shakespearean
The one who chooses me will get what he deserves”!	modern
And therefore is Love said to be a child, Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.	shakespearean
You’ll have wine enough, my lord, soon.	modern
Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend, More hideous when thou show’st thee in a child Than the sea monster.	shakespearean
This one, and I will give her to you.	modern
May God’s blessing go with you and with all who turn bad into good, and enemies into friends!	modern
I’ve heard all about you women and your cosmetics too.	modern
Thou liest, malignant thing!	shakespearean
I thank God, I thank God!	shakespearean
Crowner’s quest law.	shakespearean
But as for now—before two weeks have gone by, I’m going to send some people packing.	modern
And when I told you he was involved the whole time I was trying to get Desdemona, you were like, “Oh, really?” And then you frowned and wrinkled up your forehead as if you were imagining something horrible.	modern
Let’s go.	modern
Let me see what he looks like, so when I see another man who resembles him, I’ll know to avoid him.	modern
Why seek’st thou me?	shakespearean
You bring me out.	shakespearean
Pray heaven it be State matters, as you think, and no conception Nor no jealous toy concerning you.	shakespearean
Military music and military rites will speak for his heroic qualities.	modern
In that case, I don’t much care for you either.	modern
Please don’t take my niece the wrong way, sir.	modern
Queen, you knew very well that my heart was tied to your ship and that you would pull me along with you.	modern
Shut up your doors.	shakespearean
No, you won’t die yourself, but only by proxy.	modern
Rather make My country’s high pyramides my gibbet And hang me up in chains!	shakespearean
So they are possibly Antony’s friends.	modern
No, nor mine now.	shakespearean
They’ll be here tomorrow or the next day.	modern
I won’t sleep until I see her, Hortensio.	modern
No, indeed, my lord.	shakespearean
Yes, as much as you look like yourself.	modern
Tis a fearful odds.	shakespearean
Can Fulvia die?	shakespearean
You can figure out the rest.	modern
No, but the barber’s man hath been seen with him, and the old ornament of his cheek hath already stuffed tennis balls.	shakespearean
He wants me dead.	modern
I will go on the slightest errand now to the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on.	shakespearean
I hope you’ll recognize me when we meet again.	modern
Will you let me?	modern
Please, try to act a little more serious, or the people in Belmont will get the wrong impression about me, and your wildness will make me blow my chance with Portia.	modern
Are you of good or evil?	shakespearean
Indeed, you have wronged me, you liar.	modern
But what trade art thou?	shakespearean
Best of comfort, And ever welcome to us.	shakespearean
Have you no modesty, no maiden shame, No touch of bashfulness?	shakespearean
What handkerchief?	modern
Come here, sir.	modern
Go softly on.	shakespearean
Look where she comes.	shakespearean
There she is.	modern
The Lord Mayor is knocking.	modern
I have said.	shakespearean
And you’re not to utter a syllable of Tranio’s name.	modern
Opportunity’s knocking for you, and in my imagination I see a crown dropping onto your head.	modern
And that’s how she died?	modern
Find out who did it!	modern
I commend my duty to your lordship.	shakespearean
I’ve wanted to see you for a long time now, but I sent for you so hastily because I need your help right away.	modern
You taught me language, and all I can do with it is curse.	modern
Let every eye nogetiate for itself And trust no agent, for beauty is a witch Against whose charms faith melteth into blood.	shakespearean
If only all struggles ended this well.	modern
Watch out, Ophelia.	modern
Oh, wouldn’t it be great if property, rank, official positions, and other honors were earned only by merit, not by corruption?	modern
What man is that?	shakespearean
Her length of sickness, with what else more serious Importeth thee to know, this bears.	shakespearean
For me, the gold of France did not seduce, Although I did admit it as a motive The sooner to effect what I intended; But God be thankèd for prevention, Which I in sufferance heartily will rejoice, Beseeching God and you to pardon me.	shakespearean
Tell him, so please him come unto this place, He shall be satisfied and, by my honor, Depart untouched.	shakespearean
Your father was ever virtuous, and holy men at their death have good inspirations.	shakespearean
Your wife and children were savagely slaughtered.	modern
I will praise any man that will praise me, though it cannot be denied what I have done by land.	shakespearean
I want all such offenders to be dealt with that way, and I give precise orders that in our progress through the country there shall be nothing seized from the villages, nothing taken that is not paid for, none of the French harassed or abused in disrespectful language.	modern
I hear someone knocking at the south entry.	modern
Are you hurt, lieutenant?	modern
So let’s see it.	modern
I wouldn’t have dared!	modern
But wherefore could not I pronounce “Amen”?	shakespearean
Your vote will be as strong as anyone’s in the reordering of the government.	modern
Let us be sacrificers but not butchers, Caius.	shakespearean
Isn’t it strange, Canidius, that he could cross the Ionian Sea so quickly from Tarentum and Brundusium and take Toryne?—Have you heard about this, sweet?	modern
O, she would laugh me Out of myself, press me to death with wit.	shakespearean
The guilty speak volumes even when they’re silent.	modern
Is he not light of brain?	shakespearean
Take me to the edge of it, and I’ll reward all your troubles with something valuable.	modern
Doth not the day break here?	shakespearean
Out of their saddles into the dirt, and thereby hangs a tale.	shakespearean
Who comes here?	shakespearean
And if it sort not well, you may conceal her, As best befits her wounded reputation, In some reclusive and religious life, Out of all eyes, tongues, minds, and injuries.	shakespearean
Oh, go, leave me.	modern
Listen to me, madam.	modern
I can hear the lark singing.	modern
And you deadly cannons that roar like thunderbolts thrown by the gods, goodbye!	modern
Signor Antonio, you’ve often insulted my money and my business practices in the Rialto.	modern
Though our lives—   We have decided, my lord.	modern
What is ’t, Ophelia, he hath said to you?	shakespearean
Madam, good night.	shakespearean
You’ll find I’ll give it to you very willingly.	modern
This disease is beyond my practice.	shakespearean
With bills on their necks: “Be it known unto all men by these presents.”  The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the duke’s wrestler, which Charles in a moment threw him and broke three of his ribs, that there is little hope of life in him.	shakespearean
Here comes another Jew.	modern
Folded the writ up in form of th' other, Subscribed it, gave ’t th' impression, placed it safely, The changeling never known.	shakespearean
It is so.	shakespearean
Are you blushing?	modern
Do you put tricks upon ’s with savages and men of Ind, ha?	shakespearean
I don’t know how to ask you for forgiveness, but I have to say something.	modern
Pray you now, forget and forgive.	shakespearean
The watery kingdom, whose ambitious head Spits in the face of heaven, is no bar To stop the foreign spirits, but they come As o'er a brook to see fair Portia.	shakespearean
Here, Signior Tranio, This bird you aimed at, though you hit her not.— Therefore a health to all that shot and missed.	shakespearean
Oh, in the duke of Gloucester’s wallet.	modern
But stay calm, and don’t get carried away by rage, or I’ll think you’re not a man.	modern
You said the enemy wouldn’t come down but keep to the hills and upper regions.	modern
You are a fool.—You, niece, prepare to leave.	modern
This is Cinna.	modern
This is the silliest thing I’ve ever seen.	modern
I prithee let me hear it.	shakespearean
Take up my mistress' gown for thy master’s use!	shakespearean
I will laugh like a hyena, and that when thou art inclined to sleep.	shakespearean
The best thing to do is crawl under his cloak.	modern
No, really, I’m not.	modern
But that’s not how you’re going to be.	modern
To be a well-favored man is the gift of fortune, but to write and read comes by nature.	shakespearean
There is an emergency I must take care of, but my whole heart will remain here with you.	modern
Is he right?	modern
Oh, how bitter it is that Edward—the real “true, noble prince”—should still be alive!	modern
Now from head to foot I am marble-constant.	shakespearean
Is your master coming?	modern
O momentary grace of mortal men, Which we more hunt for than the grace of God!	shakespearean
I was a reasonable man, then I became a fool, and finally a beast!	modern
Wake up, sir, wake up.	modern
Go seek him out, speak fair, and bring the body Into the chapel.	shakespearean
You seem like a good judge.	modern
I' faith, sir, you shall never need to fear.	shakespearean

I hope we’ve corrected that fault pretty well in our company, sir.	modern
She’s probably right.	modern
That she may long live here, God say amen.	shakespearean
Reproach and everlasting shame Sits mocking in our plumes.	shakespearean
You can give good news in many ways, but let bad news interpret itself as you tell it.	modern
What a silly monster, to think a poor drunk is wonderful.	modern
Look you, the worm is not to be trusted but in the keeping of wise people, for indeed there is no goodness in the worm.	shakespearean
Had I but died an hour before this chance, I had lived a blessèd time, for from this instant There’s nothing serious in mortality.	shakespearean
Let us quit all And give our vineyards to a barbarous people.	shakespearean
If much you note him, You shall offend him and extend his passion.	shakespearean
The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take their leave.	shakespearean
I hear it by the way; but I will send.	shakespearean
Well met, honest gentleman.	shakespearean
Tomorrow is the happy day, Audrey.	modern
But I could see that Cupid’s fiery arrow was put out by watery, virginal moonbeams, so the royal virgin continued her virginal thoughts without being interrupted by thoughts of love.	modern
It would seem strange unto him when he waked.	shakespearean
What think’st thou then of Stanley?	shakespearean
Did he beg my pardon?	modern
I partly guess, for I have loved ere now.	shakespearean
Ay, my lord.	shakespearean
What is ’t?	shakespearean
And what noise is this?	shakespearean
Cheer up and be at peace.	modern
Is all our company here?	shakespearean
Cicero is dead, And by that order of proscription.	shakespearean
Now, Antony, our prayers have been answered.	modern
Excellently, excellently.	modern
That’s enough.	modern
I know thee well enough.	shakespearean
No, he did not.	modern
Is it for him you do envy me so?	shakespearean
Is that what you’ve heard?	modern
Answer when I call your name.—Nick Bottom, the weaver?	modern
Dear Celia—I already look much happier than I feel, but you want me to look even happier?	modern
Lead the way.	modern
Oh, my reputation, Iago, my reputation!	modern
Th’ art an honest man.	shakespearean
Where are my slippers?	modern
He cried out, “Wait for me, dear cousin.	modern
Tis here.	shakespearean
You’re doing the right thing.	modern
Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing?— Come, sister, you shall be the priest and marry us.—Give me your hand, Orlando.—What do you say, sister?	shakespearean
He has already been named king and has left for Scone to be crowned.	modern
That’s what we’re trying to say, sir.	modern
Were you drunk when you seemed so hopeful before?	modern
But since he is better we have therefore odds.	shakespearean
All right, I’ll stop.	modern
I’m just worried that you’ve been cozying up to her, and gotten intimate with her.	modern
You must be crazy to say that!	modern
This will make our actions seem practical and not vengeful.	modern
I dare pawn down my life for him that he hath wrote this to feel my affection to your honor and to no other pretense of danger.	shakespearean
There’s but one down.	shakespearean
So it’s no surprise that Demetrius runs away from me as if I were a monster.	modern
They are his shards, and he	shakespearean
This is that time.	modern
I kiss his dirty shoe, and from the bottom of my heart I love the lovely boy.	modern
I need to be alone with my thoughts for a while and don’t want any company.	modern
Monster, I do smell all horse piss, at which my nose is in great indignation.	shakespearean
You can hear them all night long.	modern
Afraid that your anger would not subside, she sent you word she was dead.	modern
Could that be a lawyer’s skull?	modern
And maidens call it “love-in-idleness.” Fetch me that flower.	shakespearean
Now, Roderigo, where did you see her?—Oh, that miserable wretch!—You say you saw her with the Moor?—Oh, who would want to be a father?—How did you know it was her?—To think she tricked me so easily!—What did she say to you?—Get me more candles, and wake up all my relatives.	modern
Sir, he’s rash and very sudden in choler, and haply may strike at you.	shakespearean
Her name is Portia, nothing undervalued To Cato’s daughter, Brutus' Portia.	shakespearean
I am their aunt, and I love them like a mother.	modern
A good persuasion.	shakespearean
Let’s play.	modern
Think about it.	modern
What are you thinking?	modern
What I should deny— As this I would, ay, though thou didst produce My very character—I’d turn it all To thy suggestion, plot, and damnèd practice.	shakespearean
Tis noble spoken.	shakespearean
And who is England’s king but great York’s heir?	shakespearean
This means I’ve mistreated Edgar.	modern
I’ll write how, under his flag and with his well-paid troops, we have beaten the formerly unvanquished Parthia.	modern
Will it be in thunder, lightning, or rain?	modern
It’s true, this so-called “god”—he shook.	modern
Yes, we get the idea.	modern
My mistress showed me you in the moon and your dog and your bush.	modern
No, Cassio is not killed.	shakespearean
Why would Titania want to argue with her Oberon?	modern
As king of this country I like to reward wit when I hear it.	modern
Let me take my chances.	modern
Did my father strike my gentleman For chiding of his fool?	shakespearean
My creditors grow cruel.	shakespearean
Madman and beggar too.	shakespearean
Wait, don’t rush!	modern
I won’t say anything negative about what he might be.	modern
You are both sure, and will assist me?	shakespearean
Let go of me!	modern
I heard myself proclaimed, And by the happy hollow of a tree Escaped the hunt.	shakespearean
Ay, a tailor, sir.	shakespearean
What bastard doth not?	shakespearean
Less than a month after my father’s death, even before the tears on her cheeks had dried, she remarried.	modern
So Chrish save me, I will cut off your head.	shakespearean
At my house.	modern
This is her very guise; and, upon my life, fast asleep.	shakespearean
I will go straight to visit him.	modern
I had planned to celebrate it quietly, but since my lord is once more himself, I will be Cleopatra again.	modern
I can’t blame her.	modern
I think the sun where he was born Drew all such humors from him.	shakespearean
My God!	modern
I only need to show your sword to Caesar and tell him about your death to get into his good favor.	modern
How will you wreck this marriage?	modern
I must employ you in some business Against our nuptial and confer with you Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.	shakespearean
Some to Ligarius’s.	modern
I was sure that you hadn’t given it to me.	modern
So let high-sighted tyranny range on Till each man drop by lottery.	shakespearean
I feel I should recognize you and that man	modern
Get out of here quickly!	modern
Love, and be friends as two such men should be.	shakespearean
If this be so, why blame you me to love you?	shakespearean
I’ll not endure it.	shakespearean
Thou livest.	shakespearean
He should go up and offer his petition to Caesar now.	modern
and patches of righteousness.	modern
Oh, strange!	shakespearean
O thou dull Moor!	shakespearean
And one Deformed is one of them.	shakespearean
Upon her landing, Antony sent to her, Invited her to supper.	shakespearean
By eight o'clock.	modern
But tell me, how is your cousin?	modern
Why then, he is alive.	shakespearean
We will here part.	shakespearean
A commodity in question, I warrant you.—Come, we’ll obey you.	shakespearean
There, take it to you, trenchers, cups, and all!	shakespearean
But, God be thanked, there is no need of me, And much I need to help you, were there need.	shakespearean
Men tend to be at their most irresponsible when they’re away from home.	modern
But since I’ve gotten myself involved this far, because I’m so stupidly honest and because I like you so much, I’ll keep going.	modern
It’s coming toward me.	modern
So may you lose your arms.	shakespearean
Gouge out his eyes!	modern
Help, help, oh, help!	modern
Is her voice pitched high or low?	modern
Thou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes.	shakespearean
You wrong me every way.	shakespearean
Okay, just stay quiet.	modern
Yet here she is allowed her virgin crants, Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home Of bell and burial.	shakespearean
Places, everyone!	modern
And let me kill Cassio.	modern
But I’m overjoyed!	modern
Nay, but who is it?	shakespearean
Tis a worthy governor.	shakespearean
Lecherous Cleopatra, may all the charms of love soften those withered lips!	modern
If Echo were as fast, he would be worth a dozen like Belman.	modern
Good noble ladies, be brave.	modern
Ah, Desdemona, away, away, away!	shakespearean
Descend, for you must be my torchbearer.	shakespearean
Dost thou understand me, man?	shakespearean
How are you, Roderigo?	modern
Give him room.	modern
Doth not the gentleman Deserve as full as fortunate a bed As ever Beatrice shall couch upon?	shakespearean
I beg you, daughter, don’t make me crazy.	modern
Did you see the king today, Lord Derby?	modern
Heard you this, Gonzalo?	shakespearean
Why, you must not speak that yet.	shakespearean
You aren’t wood, you aren’t stones—you’re men.	modern
You’re a fool.	modern
Cut yourself?	modern
So, if all turns out fine, as you say, it’s more than we deserve or I expect.	modern
Fear it, Ophelia.	shakespearean
Yes, I do.	modern
It is impossible you should see this, Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys, As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross As ignorance made drunk.	shakespearean
There is a crab-apple here.	modern
Don’t let the heavens hear these chattery women abuse the Lord’s anointed king.	modern
Fair Katherine, and most fair, Will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms Such as will enter at a lady’s ear And plead his love suit to her gentle heart?	shakespearean
Get up from your beds as if you were rising out of your own graves, and walk like ghosts to come witness this horror.	modern
Run one before And let the Queen know of our gests.	shakespearean
I will chop her into messes!	shakespearean
No, listen to it, Antony.	modern
For Edward, for my brother, for his sake.	shakespearean
How could so many people, under two masters, get along under one roof?	modern
What’s the matter That you unlace your reputation thus And spend your rich opinion for the name Of a night-brawler?	shakespearean
Go, but sign the deed.	modern
Who was with them last?	modern
Fourscore ducats!	shakespearean
If what you say is true, you can do the same to me.	modern
No, sir, I say his horse comes, with him on his back.	shakespearean
There’s mine.	shakespearean
Be patient, for you shall remain with us.	shakespearean
At a word, I am not.	shakespearean
Let them set on at once, for I perceive But cold demeanor in Octavius' wing, And sudden push gives them the overthrow.	shakespearean
You know where she is.	modern
What thou wouldst do Is done unto thy hand.	shakespearean
Who knows he is?	shakespearean
Go get some water, And wash this filthy witness from your hand.	shakespearean
Well I know the man.	shakespearean
I believe it.	modern
Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath?	shakespearean
What make you from home?	shakespearean
Save means to live.	shakespearean
Excuse me.	modern
I’m the one who— I’ll get right on that.	modern
It’s midnight.	modern
The readiest way to make the wench amends Is to become her husband and her father; The which will I, not all so much for love As for another secret close intent By marrying her which I must reach unto.	shakespearean
We should rip off your man’s clothing and show the world the woman who has represented her own kind so badly.	modern
Let’s go to the temple first.	modern
O, what men dare do!	shakespearean
Let me at him.	modern
What good luck!	modern
If you be well pleased with this And hold your fortune for your bliss, Turn you where your lady is And claim her with a loving kiss.”	shakespearean
But how strange that Beatrice should seem to know who I was and yet not know at the same time.	modern
But yet, alas, stood I within his grace, I would prefer him to a better place.	shakespearean
I would eat his heart in the marketplace.	shakespearean
I have to stay with the servants, who are with our camp’s luggage.	modern
There must be a strange explanation for this—if it’s true.	modern
Don’t let him leave out the color of her hair.	modern
What tributaries follow him to Rome To grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels?	shakespearean
Lovers, moan and weep.	modern
Let him thank me, that holp to send him thither, For he was fitter for that place than earth.	shakespearean
Don’t you	modern
Your superiors.	modern
Oh, that’s a brave man.	shakespearean
Ay, my good lord.	shakespearean
Don’t you trust my sword and these wounds?	modern
By heaven, I will acquaint his majesty With those gross taunts that oft I have endured.	shakespearean
Come, Balthasar, we’ll hear that song again.	shakespearean
We look for you tomorrow.	shakespearean
From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.	shakespearean
It’s a bad time for such an injury.	modern
What kind of game is this?	modern
That methinks is strange.	shakespearean
To the seaside straightway!	shakespearean
Put on your nightgown.	shakespearean
The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them, But where, to say the truth, I do not know.	shakespearean
I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.	shakespearean
The red plague rid you For learning me your language!	shakespearean
Get out!	modern
I dare assure thee that no enemy Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus.	shakespearean
Now all my enemies are at my mercy.	modern
This falls out better than I could devise.	shakespearean
Go inside yourself.	modern
Look, your wife is with him.	modern
Nor I.	shakespearean
But I have none.	shakespearean
When the actors were talking about poison?	modern
We’ll have thee to a couch Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed On purpose trimmed up for Semiramis.	shakespearean
What’s your grace’s will?	shakespearean
That’s not your fault!	modern
Ghastly looks Are at my service, like enforcèd smiles, And both are ready in their offices, At any time to grace my stratagems.	shakespearean
I wouldn’t either, by daylight.	modern
You get my point, don’t you?	modern
That, sir, which I will not report after her.	shakespearean
You inhuman dog!	modern
If you wish.	modern
Don’t be shy—shake hands with me.	modern
You envy my advancement, and my friends'.	shakespearean
You wrong me, Signior Gremio.	shakespearean
Hello, Cassio!	modern
Is it new and old too?	shakespearean
Till noon?	shakespearean
Yes, he was born at Monmouth, Captain Gower.	modern
It is not the custom for the maids in France to kiss before they are married, is that what she says?	modern
I know when one is dead and when one lives.	shakespearean
Why, thou sayst well.	shakespearean
This green plot shall be our stage, this hawthorn-brake our tiring-house, and we will do it in action as we will do it before the duke.	shakespearean
Tis certain he hath passed the river Somme.	shakespearean
As long as heaven and nature extend it.	modern
If any legs here are Trinculo’s, these are.	modern
Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.	shakespearean
Lord, what fools these mortals are!	modern
A thing for me?	shakespearean
Presently away, For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure.— Come, lady, die to live.	shakespearean
Yet that is but a crushed necessity, Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves.	shakespearean
Nay, pray you throw none away.	shakespearean
I’m going now.	modern
The time has been That, when the brains were out, the man would die, And there an end.	shakespearean
We do, my lord.	shakespearean
But mock me gently, dear Kate, because I love you terribly.	modern
Come, come, away.	shakespearean
My hearty friends, You take me in too dolorous a sense, For I spake to you for your comfort, did desire you To burn this night with torches.	shakespearean
Where’s that mongrel?	shakespearean
But God forgive me for bragging.	modern
I may not leave it so.	shakespearean
Let’s go inside and we’ll answer all your questions truthfully.	modern
Oh, ceremony, only show me your value!	modern
Now Lord be thanked for my good amends!	shakespearean
Do you not hear me speak?	shakespearean
Don’t be scared.	modern
It shall be called “Bottom’s Dream” because it hath no bottom.	shakespearean
Make your boasts come true, and I’ll be thrilled.	modern
But for the handkerchief— By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.	shakespearean
She dies for ’t.—Eros, ho!	shakespearean
The next Caesarion smite, Till by degrees the memory of my womb, Together with my brave Egyptians all, By the discandying of this pelleted storm Lie graveless till the flies and gnats of Nile Have buried them for prey!	shakespearean
I should ev'n die with pity To see another thus.	shakespearean
Good-bye, noble Agrippa.	modern
Let us withdraw.	shakespearean
Please avoid doing that.	modern
King Edward was going to marry Lady Lucy—your mother can vouch for that—and then he was betrothed to Bona, the King of France’s sister-in-law.	modern
No, and I didn’t hear anything either, or suspect anything at all.	modern
We’ll have to think about it carefully.	modern
Are you coming monster?	modern
What should I say?	modern
A man with a wife like that might ask, “Hey, wandering wit, where are you off to?” Nah, better save the questions for when you find her in your neighbor’s bed.	modern
I put it in the pocket of my gown.	shakespearean
The taper burneth in your closet, sir.	shakespearean
The rest shall keep as they are.	shakespearean
People who are either too serious or too silly are awful.	modern
O coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me!	shakespearean
But tell me, Egeus.	modern
It is very true.	shakespearean
I’ll fight until they hack the flesh off my bones.	modern
Let’s stay and watch a while.	modern
Know’st thou not the duke Hath banished me, his daughter?	shakespearean
Isn’t their ingratitude like the mouth biting the hand that feeds it?	modern
Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it.	shakespearean
O Regan, she hath tied Sharp-toothed unkindness, like a vulture, here.	shakespearean
Then that’s the way it may turn out.	modern
What, you ignore my kind advice and try to please the devil I’m warning you about?	modern
Where is Montjoy the herald?	shakespearean
If you want to see your deceiver, then look at me.	modern
She’s dead as earth.	shakespearean
Do you know why the nose is in the middle of a person’s face?	modern
Yes, my lord, but I can spoil it.	modern
Where’s the jury, the judge, the lawful proceedings, the verdict?	modern
What’s here?	shakespearean
My Cordelia, even the gods admire how much you’ve sacrificed for me.	modern
Please, let’s not talk about it.	modern
If her breath were as terrible as her words, she would kill every living thing from here to the furthest star.	modern
God 'ild you for your last company.	shakespearean
They are pitiful.	shakespearean
Mean you to enjoy him then?	shakespearean
There is a litter ready.	shakespearean
Yes, madam, but he’ll be back tonight.	modern
So the fool follows after.	shakespearean
I heard nothing.	shakespearean
Hark, hark!	shakespearean
I doubt it not, sir, but you will curse your wooing.— Neighbor, this is a gift very grateful, I am sure of it.	shakespearean
Men’s faces are truthful, whatever their hands do.	modern
Oh weary reckoning!	shakespearean
That’s true, they are.	modern
What in the contrary?	shakespearean
When all’s done, You look but on a stool.	shakespearean
I’ll teach you to drink hard by the time you leave.	modern
Say that I did all this for love of her.	shakespearean
If I extinguish the candle, I can light it again if I regret it.	modern
So the sins of my mother should be visited upon me.	shakespearean
Where is this sight?	shakespearean
He has deserved it, were it carbuncled Like holy Phoebus’ car.	shakespearean
It doesn’t matter.	modern
No, I’m sure your Grace won’t be able to persuade him to try a second round, even though you couldn’t dissuade him from trying the first.	modern
I do not like the office.	shakespearean
Oh, God!	modern
He that has the two fair daughters—is ’t he you mean?	shakespearean
I can’t offer her more than all I have.	modern
I’ve heard that’s not the most nourishing food.	modern
Thanks, Guildenstern and worthy Rosencrantz.	modern
You’re like the poor cat in the old story.	modern
I think he thinks upon the savage bull.	shakespearean
He doth nothing but frown, as who should say, “An you will not have me, choose.” He hears merry tales and smiles not.	shakespearean
She already has a face.	modern
My lord, there needs no such apology.	shakespearean
Wherefore rejoice?	shakespearean
He married but his occasion here.	shakespearean
It’s all right, since they left their food behind, and we’re hungry.	modern
Would I were satisfied!	shakespearean
Imperious Caesar, dead and turned to clay, Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.	shakespearean
It’s about who I am, and how, why, and where this handkerchief was stained.	modern
What dost you mean by this?	shakespearean
However your wit and luck allow.	modern
All ports I’ll bar.	shakespearean
Yet fortune cannot recompense me better Than to die well, and not my master’s debtor.	shakespearean
Are you sick?	modern
Yes, if a woman grows up to be a man.	modern
Leave her to heaven And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge To prick and sting her.	shakespearean
And isn’t a sheep’s grease as wholesome as a man’s sweat?	modern
I’ll have my bond.	shakespearean
His present and your pains we thank you for.	shakespearean
These many, then, shall die.	shakespearean
Ask it something, Horatio.	modern
So let’s join forces and get revenge.	modern
Richard except, those whom we fight against Had rather have us win than him they follow.	shakespearean
Can you stay awake a bit longer and play a few tunes on your lute?	modern
The things that threatened me Ne'er looked but on my back.	shakespearean
None in the world, nor do I know the man.	shakespearean
I’m your daughter.	modern
Show me, my women, like a queen.	shakespearean
Your  I mean my daughter is my flesh and blood.	modern
Curse my father’s ambition!	modern
What kind of beard should I wear for the part?	modern
How did this happen?	modern
Don’t bring me any more reports.	modern
And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?	shakespearean
Thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense, so forcible is thy wit.	shakespearean
Either Charles or some prettier thing has mastered you.	modern
So why aren’t our eyelids heavy?	modern
The Emperor calls Canidius.	shakespearean
I’m making a kind offer—zero percent financing.	modern
I’m sure he had more hair on his tail than I have on my face when I last saw him.	modern
There are women like that out there, no question.	modern
Do not go forth today.	shakespearean
Young man, when you wake up, if she’s nearby, beg her to cure your lovesickness.	modern
But I will tell you at some meeter season.	shakespearean
More wonderful, when angels are so angry.	shakespearean
Yes, with the sign underneath him that says: “Here lives Benedick the married man”?	modern
Upon this hint I spake.	shakespearean
This is just another one of the hallucinations you always get when you’re afraid.	modern
And look how he’s repaid poor Clarence for his loyalty—penned him up like a pig being fattened for slaughter.	modern
Or if thou follow me, do not believe But I shall do thee mischief in the wood.	shakespearean
And you, fair sister.	shakespearean
I will make fast the doors and gild myself With some more ducats, and be with you straight.	shakespearean
For what favor?	modern
The generals want to speak with us.	modern
If I see anything tonight that convinces me not to marry her, I’ll shame her tomorrow in the very congregation where I would have married her.	modern
I am no child, no babe.	shakespearean
You’re perfect, without a rival in the world, made up of the best qualities of every creature.	modern
Just let me say one prayer!	modern
Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh, Till I be brought to such a silly pass!	shakespearean
Why, this is a more exquisite song than the other.	shakespearean
Oh righteous God, how can I thank you enough that this meat-eating mutt preys on his mother’s children and forces her to join others in their grief!	modern
I have forsworn his bed and company.	shakespearean
Besides, there is no king, be his cause never so spotless, if it come to the arbitrament of swords, can try it out with all unspotted soldiers.	shakespearean
Are you all good and honest men?	modern
If he wakes up before we kill him, he’ll never stop punishing us.	modern
So I welcome this wind freely.	modern
Bring me a father that so loved his child, Whose joy of her is overwhelmed like mine, And bid him speak of patience.	shakespearean
At Pembroke, or at Ha'rfordwest in Wales.	shakespearean
I wish I were in an alehouse in London!	modern
I want to learn how to lie.	modern
I asked you again, and you scratched your head and stamped your foot impatiently.	modern
Thus must I from the smoke into the smother, From tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother.	shakespearean
Herein I see thou lov’st me not with the full weight that I love thee.	shakespearean
Oh, there’s the problem.	modern
I think he be angry indeed.	shakespearean
Dream on, dream on, of bloody deeds and death.	shakespearean
You’re standing.	modern
Thou art a boil, A plague-sore or embossèd carbuncle In my corrupted blood.	shakespearean
You have weapons?	modern
How can I help you?	modern
We know each other’s faces; for our hearts, He knows no more of mine than I of yours, Or I of his, my lord, than you of mine.— Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love.	shakespearean
Have I, my lord?	shakespearean
Tomorrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit, and he that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well.	shakespearean
It were too gross To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.	shakespearean
Put off your maiden blushes, avouch the thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress, take me by the hand, and say “Harry of England, I am thine,” which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine ear withal, but I will tell	shakespearean
Okay, I will—on Fridays and Saturdays, and the rest.	modern
Then I guess the whole world is one.	modern
Let him that loves me strike me dead.	shakespearean
Why, fare thee well.	shakespearean
Good friend,” quoth he, “Say the firm Roman to great Egypt sends This treasure of an oyster, at whose foot, To mend the petty present, I will piece Her opulent throne with kingdoms.	shakespearean
Are you not well?	shakespearean
Thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords In our own proper entrails.	shakespearean
I think that our father will leave here tonight.	modern
Give me audience, good madam.	shakespearean
You’d give the moon a shove if it got stuck five weeks in its orbit.	modern
Well, get out of here then!	modern
Let me have surgeons.	shakespearean
I hourly learn A doctrine of obedience, and would gladly Look him i’ th’ face.	shakespearean
Please don’t, sir.	modern
Your servants ever Have theirs, themselves, and what is theirs in compt, To make their audit at your highness' pleasure, Still to return your own.	shakespearean
His words were, “Farewell, mistress.” Nothing else.	shakespearean
He’s given me a second life, and marrying her makes him a second father to me.	modern
Are you headed to the Tower?	modern
No, it doesn’t mean anything.	modern
I often came where I did hear of her, but cannot find her.	shakespearean
Anyway, even if he had the money now, the Jew probably wouldn’t take it.	modern
A little water clears us of this deed.	shakespearean
What’s the matter here, gentlemen?—Honest Iago, you look upset.	modern
A sweet woman!	modern
I will be faithful.	shakespearean
Well, I wouldn’t want to undo the naughtiness, since the boy turned out so well.	modern
Now, by the world—      'Tis full of thy foul wrongs.	shakespearean
Why then, the beef, and let the mustard rest.	shakespearean
You swear never to mention what you’ve seen.	modern

What’s wrong?	modern
Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you.	shakespearean
I would have been what I am even if the most virginal star in the heavens had twinkled at my conception.	modern
You have to stop talking like this.	modern
Mark Antony shall say I am not well, And for thy humor I will stay at home.	shakespearean
Look, it’s waving me over again.	modern
Can you buy them with money?	modern
Not Caesar’s valor hath o’erthrown Antony, But Antony’s hath triumphed on itself.	shakespearean
Stanley dreamed the boar beheaded him, and I laughed and refused to flee with him.	modern
When I was with him I have heard him swear To Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen, That he would rather have Antonio’s flesh Than twenty times the value of the sum That he did owe him.	shakespearean
My good friends, hark!	shakespearean
What is it, my dear Bianca?	modern
Be witness to me, O thou blessèd moon, When men revolted shall upon record Bear hateful memory, poor Enobarbus did Before thy face repent.	shakespearean
I go to take my stand To see him pass on to the Capitol.	shakespearean
Look, they weep, And I, an ass, am onion-eyed.	shakespearean
Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.	shakespearean
Oh, how brave of you!	modern
I pitied you, worked hard to teach you to speak, and taught you some new thing practically every hour.	modern
Are these wind instruments?	modern
Whenever a king sighs, everyone groans.	modern
Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end!	shakespearean
For your part, To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony.	shakespearean
What prisoners of good sort are taken, uncle?	shakespearean
What ho, the Emperor’s guard!	shakespearean
I have done.	shakespearean
Give me thy hand.	shakespearean
They were traitors.	modern
Protect me, my friends.	modern
Forgive me, your grace.	modern
Do you work in this house?	modern
Tonight I received a letter from my sister telling me all about them—and warning me not be at home in case they come to stay at my house.	modern
Mine honor was not yielded, But conquered merely.	shakespearean
There’s no one else here.	modern
Hail, most dear Caesar!	shakespearean
Brought you Caesar home?	shakespearean
Well, come, my Kate.	shakespearean
That’s enough for me, then.	modern
Grieved I I had but one?	shakespearean
If you do love me you will find me out.— Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof.	shakespearean
Bring us the letters.	modern
Thy luster thickens When he shines by.	shakespearean
If you don’t mind, I’d like to speak with you.	modern
The queen is here on special business, and her army has moved on.	modern
Put on what weary negligence you please, You and your fellow servants.	shakespearean
Hey, Grumio!	modern
No, dear Queen.	modern
It was probably just a rumor.	modern
Shall we be sundered?	shakespearean
Well, masters, we hear our charge.	shakespearean
I’m afraid it will make you too hot, too.	modern
I often wander around in the woods like a forest ranger until the sun rises in the fiery red sky over the ocean, turning the salty green water to gold.	modern
Let him come forward.	modern
But let’s shake hands, Menas.	modern
Whatever pertains to myself I will deal with last.	modern
Enobarbus, Antony has sent you all your treasure, with generous gifts besides.	modern
From France there comes a power Into this scattered kingdom, who already, Wise in our negligence, have secret feet In some of our best ports and are at point To show their open banner.	shakespearean
Signior Hortensio, ’twixt such friends as we Few words suffice.	shakespearean
This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.	shakespearean
I’ll talk to you again tomorrow.	modern
Farewell, good Charles.	shakespearean
You were best to tell Antonio what you hear— Yet do not suddenly, for it may grieve him.	shakespearean
They follow the king’s pleasure.	shakespearean
I can’t believe it.” The tears fell from her eyes like holy water.	modern
He is descried.	shakespearean
Eight score eight hours?	shakespearean
Buck up, boy!	modern
While grace is saying, hood mine eyes Thus with my hat, and sigh and say, “Amen”— Use all the observance of civility Like one well studied in a sad ostent To please his grandam, never trust me more.	shakespearean
For Falstaff, he is dead, and we must earn therefore.	shakespearean
The worst thing imaginable has happened.	modern
A man no mightier than you or I in ability, yet grown as huge and frightening as tonight’s strange happenings.	modern
God give us leisure for these rites of love!	shakespearean
If it will not be, I’ll leave you.	shakespearean
From down here, I thought his eyes looked like full moons.	modern
He liked to call me a loan shark; let him think about his debt to me.	modern
If ever I live to see it, I will challenge it.	shakespearean
Who is that calls so coldly?	shakespearean
Go on.	modern
Tell me, you monster, where is my son Lucentio?	modern
Send something along to prove you’re withdrawing the orders.	modern
How are you?	modern
Swoons rather, for so bad a prayer as his Was never yet for sleep.	shakespearean
The three who share the known world are aboard your boat.	modern
Let him kill one first.	shakespearean
Let’s play billiards.	modern
Infirm of purpose!	shakespearean
If you tickle us, don’t we laugh?	modern
Well, I’ve begun my reign with a carefully thought-out plan, and I have every hope of succeeding.	modern
Tis something, nothing: 'Twas mine, ’tis his, and has been slave to thousands.	shakespearean
You’re not really my daughter, but I still have one daughter left.	modern
Good morrow, masters.	shakespearean
There’s more knocking.	modern
Ay, indeed!	shakespearean
Haply when I shall wed That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry Half my love with him, half my care and duty.	shakespearean
Yet I persuade myself to speak the truth Shall nothing wrong him.	shakespearean
I humbly take my leave.	shakespearean
I don’t know, madam.	modern
Marry, my uncle Clarence' angry ghost.	shakespearean
No more than my staying here in Rome might mean to you in Egypt.	modern
Yet I love thee too.	shakespearean
What is it, Octavia?	modern
And has my armor been put in my tent?	modern
Pray you, avoid it.	shakespearean
That you lift the death sentence on my servant, who killed a rowdy and belligerent former servant of the duke of Norfolk.	modern
Alack, my lord, what do you mean by that?	shakespearean
Fare you well.	shakespearean
Now, Catesby, what does your lord say to my request?	modern
I will be satisfied.	shakespearean
O mighty Caesar!	shakespearean
Okay, bring on the play.	modern
Be attentive.	shakespearean
But a handkerchief— God, I wish I could forget about the handkerchief!	modern
Why are you adored?	modern
I had rather break mine own.	shakespearean
And he deserves it, having been excellent before he had a reputation for it.	modern
Return to the gracious duke, good Catesby.	modern
He won’t see my face ever again.	modern
Well then, I know thee.	shakespearean
He’s now in Florence.	shakespearean
But there the Duke was given to understand That in a gondola were seen together Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica.	shakespearean
If you’re my friend, tell me what you’re thinking.	modern
Give me some light!	modern
Thou dost not wish more help from England, coz?	shakespearean
Thank God.” A good answer.	shakespearean
I should be wise, for honesty’s a fool And loses that it works for.	shakespearean
It has the mark of	modern
I must and will have Katherine to my wife.	shakespearean
All right, then.	modern
Just as high as my heart.	shakespearean
Now, by the holy mother of our Lord, The citizens are mum, say not a word.	shakespearean
Our severed navy too Have knit again, and fleet, threat’ning most sealike.	shakespearean
This is what Calphurnia’s dream means.	modern
What can I do for you, sir?	modern
Wait a minute.	modern
Tis noble Kent, your friend.	shakespearean
Why do you need even one?	modern
Let’s go, Menas.	modern
Tomorrow will we be married.	shakespearean
I am a soldier, I, Older in practice, abler than yourself To make conditions.	shakespearean
Let us prepare for our wedding.—On that day, I’ll take your oath of loyalty, my Lord of Burgundy and all my peers, to guarantee my treaty.	modern
The itch of his affection should not then Have nicked his captainship at such a point When half to half the world opposed, he being The merèd question.	shakespearean
Oh, villain!	shakespearean
I really want to sleep now.	modern
I know they are in Rome together Looking for Antony.	shakespearean
Here comes one.	shakespearean
Suppose th' Ambassador from the French comes back, Tells Harry that the king doth offer him	shakespearean
I have brought him a present.	shakespearean
Well shone, Moon!—Truly, the moon shines with a good grace.	shakespearean
Do you want to destroy our old friendship by joining these men to insult your poor friend?	modern
Tis brief, my lord.	shakespearean
But you’ve seen her and Cassio together.	modern
Besides, our hands are hard and calloused.	modern
My noble lords and relatives, good morning.	modern
Followed the old man forth.	shakespearean
And I in all unwillingness will go.	shakespearean
The even mead, that erst brought sweetly forth The freckled cowslip, burnet, and green clover, Wanting the scythe, withal uncorrected, rank, Conceives by idleness, and nothing teems But hateful docks, rough thistles, kecksies, burrs, Losing both beauty and utility.	shakespearean
Besides, our hands are hard.	shakespearean
Peace, sirrah!	shakespearean
She had put a wreath of fresh, fragrant flowers around his hairy forehead, and the drops of dew that lay in the center of the flowers made the flowers look like they were crying with shame to be decorating the head of that ugly jackass.	modern
Now to that name my courage prove my title!	shakespearean
He ran out that way, sir, when he couldn’t— Follow him, now!	modern
Five-and-twenty, sir.	shakespearean
Make these men work.	modern
Never mind.	modern
Very good.	shakespearean
What are the chances of his getting better, lords?	modern
My lord, your noble subjects are looking for you all over the camp.	modern
I have a pain upon my forehead, here.	shakespearean
I’ll make her come right away, I promise you.	modern
What’s up, mister?	modern
Fifteen years!	modern
There is means, madam.	shakespearean
It is worth the pains.	shakespearean
What is this spirit that looks like the son of a king and wears a crown on his young head?	modern
I’ll tell you, Cassius, you yourself have been called greedy and been accused of giving your positions to undeserving men in exchange for gold.	modern
Fathers who wear rags Make their children neglect them.	modern
I could make the same boast even if I had a pig as my mistress.	modern
I won’t pretend to be the devil’s porter anymore.	modern
That I won’t stand for.	modern
Why, that man is a total fraud and rascal.	modern
By God, I’m going to tell the duke how slack you’ve been.	modern
Your worship’s friend and Launcelot, sir.	shakespearean
Swear by your double self, And there’s an oath of credit!	shakespearean
Cassius, be constant.	shakespearean
Yet Edmund was beloved.	shakespearean
Would I were so too.	shakespearean
O hell-kite!	shakespearean
Wherefore weep you?	shakespearean
Her vine, the merry cheerer of the heart, Unprunèd, dies.	shakespearean
Here are the keys, and there is the duke, sleeping.	modern
I’m not much of a drinker.	modern
First, rehearse your song by rote, To each word a warbling note.	shakespearean
There, drink that for me.	shakespearean
What, art thou come?—On, gentlemen, away!	shakespearean
My news I might have told hereafter.	shakespearean
This sunken-eyed hag was brought here pregnant and left by the sailors.	modern
If so, my eyes are oftener washed than hers.	shakespearean
We beg you, for your own sake, to respect your safety and give up.	modern
Is it daytime?	modern
But now I see our lances are but straws, Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare, That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.	shakespearean
Three and three, We’ll hold a feast in great solemnity.	shakespearean
My darling, when I gave my love to you, I told you that all the wealth I had ran within my veins—that I have noble blood, but no money.	modern
Passion, I see, is catching, for mine eyes, Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine, Began to water.	shakespearean
Then be ’t so, my good lord.— How does the king?	shakespearean
So, what’s the news on the Rialto?	modern
Go forward.	modern
I’ve done no more to Caesar than you will do to me.	modern
I made no such report.	shakespearean
Do you hear, my friend?	modern
Tis hatched, and shall be so.	shakespearean
There, Leonato, take your daughter back.	modern
Exactly, madam, until I sleep with you.	modern
What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?	shakespearean
The court has sent for us.	modern
Go ahead—rage till your proud heart breaks.	modern
I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow student.	shakespearean
Good question, my girl.	modern
Prithee, go in thyself.	shakespearean
I wear it for a memorable honor, For I am Welsh, you know, good countryman.	shakespearean
Your death would prevent that.	modern
No, good mother.	shakespearean
This guy is exactly the kind of person your sister warned us about.—Come on, bring in the stocks, now!	modern
I am satisfied, as long as the maiden cities you talk of come with her.	modern
Oh, if I’ve got any influence over you at all, please patch things up with him.	modern
Would you like to be king of the entire world?	modern
Look up a-height.	shakespearean
It’s as complete a work of villainy as any that could be thought up.	modern
No, not a chance.	modern
If your affection for me doesn’t convince you to come, don’t let my letter do so.” Oh, my darling, make your arrangements and go!	modern
Is that the latest we can do it?	modern
Speak up and tell me!	modern
God have mercy, Grumio!	modern
If it takes all the wine in my bottle, I’ll cure him.	modern
I’ve often given money to people who were unable to pay back their loans to him.	modern
Say to me whose fortunes shall rise higher, Caesar’s or mine?	shakespearean
And the creature run from the cur?	shakespearean
Death of one person can be paid but once, And that she has discharged.	shakespearean
The rest will comfort, for thy counsel’s sound.	shakespearean
How poor are they that have not patience!	shakespearean
The Mayor and all his brethren in best sort, Like to the senators of th' antique Rome, With the plebeians swarming at their heels, Go forth and fetch their conquering Caesar in— As, by a lower but loving likelihood,	shakespearean
But if you had to say something nice about me, what would you say?	modern
Spout, rain!	shakespearean
Faint, fall down—if you don’t, then you’re lying about my eyes being murderers.	modern
O noble English, who could take on the entire French army with only half their forces, leaving the other half to stand by, idle and laughing.	modern
So please, old friend, give us some good advice.	modern
We are, my lord.	modern
Thou hast a lady far more beautiful Than any woman in this waning age.	shakespearean
Be silent and go in.	modern
They sit conferring by the parlor fire.	shakespearean
I charge you, in the name of God, be careful what you say.	modern
Yes, he said something in Greek.	modern
Othello, I’ve been seriously hurt.	modern
I hope your Majesty will, in all good conscience, bear me out and vouch for the fact that this is the glove of Alençon and that your Majesty gave it to me.	modern
Oh, thou art wise!	shakespearean
I am very glad of it.	shakespearean
Woe that too late repents!—   Is it your will?	shakespearean
Excuse me?	modern
What woman, then?	shakespearean
They only feel the shadow of joy.	modern
On me, though I am barely half the man that Edward was?	modern
Let him appear that’s come from Antony.	shakespearean
Now he denies it a bit, and tries to laugh it off.	modern
Their hands and faces were all covered with blood.	modern
Don’t let that lawyer ever come near my house!	modern
Skipper, stand back.	shakespearean
Come, gentlemen, Let us consult upon tomorrow’s business Into my tent.	shakespearean
But please, father—the question is still nagging at me—why did you conjure up this storm?	modern
Tear him apart, tear him up!	modern
How now, my love?	shakespearean
But either it was different in blood—	shakespearean
I don’t expect him to answer for me, and yet I’m determined to fight vigorously for him.	modern
Be thou my witness that against my will, As Pompey was, am I compelled to set Upon one battle all our liberties.	shakespearean
I doubt not of his temperance.	shakespearean
So give me your answer, and we’ll shake on it.	modern
To Brutus’s, to Cassius’s, let’s burn them all.	modern
Did you?	shakespearean
For I am Trinculo—be not afeard—thy good friend Trinculo.	shakespearean
Say, if th' hadst rather hear it from our mouths, Or from our masters'.	shakespearean
I’ll pull thee by the lesser legs.	shakespearean
Thou hast killed my child.	shakespearean
Farewell, good Launcelot.	shakespearean
So perhaps did yours.	shakespearean
Oh, that you bore The mind that I do, what a sleep were this For your advancement!	shakespearean
Oh, you lowlife!	modern
If we crown him, I have to admit we’d be giving him the power to do damage.	modern
Regan, I have good hope Thou didst not know on ’t.—Who comes here?	shakespearean
Father, this isn’t easy for me.	modern
Tell the clock there.	shakespearean
I haven’t done anything to you.	modern
Do you think I would be feeling as triumphant as I am if I didn’t know that our situation was secure?	modern
Sir, would she give you so much of her lips As of her tongue she oft bestows on me, You’ll have enough.	shakespearean
Messala, This is my birthday, as this very day Was Cassius born.	shakespearean
And yet, against all odds, I win her over!	modern
What do you want to do, Desdemona?	modern
Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome.	shakespearean
I wish my eyes were	modern
You’re welcome hither.	shakespearean
Without doubt I’ve heard that.	modern
But so what?	modern
Because that, like a jack, thou keep’st the stroke Betwixt thy begging and my meditation.	shakespearean
Dost thou hear, lady?	shakespearean
The sky shows countless stars.	modern
But, Lepidus, go you to Caesar’s house.	shakespearean
Fled this way, sir, when by no means he could— Pursue him, ho!	shakespearean
Oh, defend me!	shakespearean
It’s a wonder you didn’t lose your life and your mind all at once.—He’s waking up.	modern
Get out of here, before his bad luck infects you too.	modern
Stop advising me; your words pass through my ears like water through a sieve.	modern
Why is my lord enraged against his love?	modern
Let us swear That you are worth your breeding, which I doubt not,	shakespearean
Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass, That I may see my shadow as I pass.	shakespearean
My father’s spirit in arms.	shakespearean
Was never widow had so dear a loss.	shakespearean
How am I then a villain To counsel Cassio to this parallel course, Directly to his good?	shakespearean
But the enemy is loud.	modern
That must we also.	shakespearean
Would I were able to load him with his desert!	shakespearean
But what prevention?	shakespearean
But can I have some hope?	modern
I shook you and shouted at you, sir.	modern
Why, if two gods should play some heavenly match And on the wager lay two earthly women, And Portia one, there must be something else Pawned with the other, for the poor rude world Hath not her fellow.	shakespearean
The captain— Give it the captain.	shakespearean
If we cannot defend our country with three times such a power left at home, then we deserve to be harassed by an invader and lose our reputation as a powerful and politically savvy nation.	modern
He and Lepidus are at Caesar’s house.	modern
Bring him here dead or alive within the next year, or get out off my land.	modern
I know a lady in Venice who’d walk all the way to Palestine for a kiss from him.	modern
No, I will not cast away my physic but on those that are sick.	shakespearean
But ’tis gone.	shakespearean
Will you go, coz?	shakespearean
If my eyes don’t deceive me, you are my Rosalind.	modern
What says Polonius?	shakespearean
But he’s young, and as long as he’s too young to become king, Richard, the duke of Gloucester, has power over him.	modern
Is thy union here?	shakespearean
Why, that were covetousness.	shakespearean
Lady, you come hither to be married to this count?	shakespearean
He had no patience.	modern
Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service Did worthily perform, and I must use you In such another trick.	shakespearean
The old man’s daughter told us all.	shakespearean
The king comes here tonight.	shakespearean
Thy Clarence he is dead that stabbed my Edward, And the beholders of this frantic play, Th' adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey, Untimely smothered in their dusky graves.	shakespearean
What do I see here?	modern
Cicero too?	modern
I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the whole body.	shakespearean
A crown was offered to him, and he pushed it away with the back of his hand, like this—and then the people started shouting.	modern
Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep.	shakespearean
I feel better already, and I know there’s more good advice where that came from.	modern
That with a series of legal writs, Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus have put a hundred senators to death.	modern
If they suffer our departure, death’s the word.	shakespearean
But we are spirits of another sort.	shakespearean
So fare you well.	shakespearean
I know no touch of it, my lord.	shakespearean
I won’t hurt him.	modern
We will do the same.	modern
We’ll know all our fortunes.	shakespearean
All but mariners Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel, Then all afire with me.	shakespearean
My lord, I have news to tell you.	shakespearean
So, adieu.	shakespearean
Well, Oswald?	modern
Everyone join hands.	modern
Even their clothes are unstained, and look fresher than before the storm.	modern
The clock hasn’t struck yet.	modern
And you shall be satisfied.	shakespearean
How came he mad?	shakespearean
It waves me still.	shakespearean
I see a voice!	modern
Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato?	shakespearean
I hear it now above me.	shakespearean
Your eyes are lodestars, and your tongue’s sweet air More tunable than lark to shepherd’s ear When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.	shakespearean
For mine own good, All causes shall give way.	shakespearean
Thy dukedom I resign and do entreat Thou pardon me my wrongs.	shakespearean
I’ll change that name for you.	modern
Three-time traitor and whore!	modern
I’ll get you for that.	modern
That’s it?	modern
I’ll tell them that we won’t hurt anyone with our swords, and that Pyramus isn’t really dead.	modern
No, absolutely not.	modern
What’s the message from the English king?	modern
I have promised to make all this matter even.	shakespearean
Speak to her, Hamlet.	shakespearean
Farewell, therefore, Hero.	shakespearean
Just remember to grab his books first, since without them he’s just a poor fool like me, and can’t command a single spirit.	modern
You had a Clarence, too, and Richard killed him.	modern
Who would choose to grunt and sweat through an exhausting life, unless they were afraid of something dreadful after death, the undiscovered country from which no visitor returns, which we wonder about without getting any answers from and which makes us stick to the evils we know rather than rush off to seek the ones we don’t?	modern
Hear me for my cause, and be silent that you may hear.	shakespearean
I’ve been invited to supper, Jessica.	modern
Amen to that!	modern
But who comes here?	shakespearean
Gentlemen, gentlemen—   Gentlemen, don’t speak.	modern
By Hercules, I think I am i’ th’ right.	shakespearean
And false.	shakespearean
They’re all welcome.	modern
Please, sir, I beg you.	modern
Alas, he faints!	shakespearean
Good morrow, masters.	shakespearean
Oh, I followed something I’m ashamed to look at now!	modern
Faith, e'en with losing his wits.	shakespearean
No disgrace Shall fall you for refusing him at sea, Being prepared for land.	shakespearean
And for the more better assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am not Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver.	shakespearean
I’ll cross it though it blast me.—Stay, illusion!	shakespearean
At land indeed Thou dost o’ercount me of my father’s house, But since the cuckoo builds not for himself, Remain in ’t as thou mayst.	shakespearean
Oh, shut up.	modern
Therefore it’s certain that he wasn’t ambitious.	modern
Look how he laughs already!	shakespearean
And the poor old man just wept, mixing his tears with the rain.	modern
Thou hast, Ventidius, that Without the which a soldier and his sword Grants scarce distinction.	shakespearean
But you can make it up to me.	modern
You don’t need a ghost returning from the grave to tell you that, sir.	modern
Not even trivial things were left out.	modern
I kiss his dirty shoe, and from heartstring I love the lovely bully.	shakespearean
She would hang on to him, and the more she was with him the more she wanted to be with him; she couldn’t get enough of him.	modern
Well, it’s a fault I wouldn’t trade for your best virtue.	modern
That which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose.	shakespearean
These are tricks.	modern
Here they’ll be, man.	shakespearean
There are only friends here.	modern
No, I swear I’m not.	modern
May one be pardoned and retain th' offense?	shakespearean
Would you ever do such a thing for all the world?	modern
You are the lord of duty.	shakespearean
Good morning, my friends.	modern
Not I but my affairs have made you wait.	shakespearean
But, as they say, to hear music the general does not greatly care.	shakespearean
Keep your cabins.	shakespearean
Be quiet, Signior Gremio.	modern
Will not King Richard let me speak with him?	shakespearean
The duke of Exeter has very gallantly maintained the pridge.	shakespearean
No problem, madam.	modern
Swallows have built nests in Cleopatra’s sails.	modern
How now, lady?	shakespearean
Even he, madam.	shakespearean
All right, have it your way.	modern
I can’t wait to hear him call the drunkard “husband,” and to watch my men smother their laughter as they pay their respects to this simple peasant.	modern
Good morrow, old Sir Thomas Erpingham.	shakespearean
List a brief tale, And when ’tis told, oh, that my heart would burst!	shakespearean
The king, his brother, and your brother are all waiting there in a crazed state of mind, and the rest are grieving over them, sad and astonished.	modern
The more my wrong, the more his spite appears.	shakespearean
Come on, men!	modern
And aroint thee, witch, aroint thee!	shakespearean
Soldier, why wear’st thou that glove in thy cap?	shakespearean
What would you like me to do?	modern
Where are those bastards?	modern
Hear Antony.	shakespearean
They would like me to be as familiar with men’s pockets as their gloves and handkerchiefs, which goes against my manhood, because to take something from another’s pocket and put it into my own is plain stealing.	modern
Come, brother; away!	shakespearean
I grow old, and all dignity has been thrashed out of me.	modern
That’s not how I do business.	modern
In return, I must clear the sea of pirates and send tributes of wheat to Rome.	modern
How goes the world with thee?	shakespearean
Then, tell me, Who’s the next heir of Naples?	shakespearean
Why, she challenges me like a Muslim would challenge a Christian.	modern
Show it!	modern
Peace, ho!	shakespearean
The count is neither sad nor sick nor cheerful nor well—he’s just civil, as Seville as an orange, with the same jealous-yellow complexion.	modern
That’s true.	modern
The cowslips tall her pensioners be.	shakespearean
Come on.	modern
Let me try: If there’s a buck who needs a doe Tell him Rosalind will do.	modern
I will weep.	shakespearean
I’ll give the first one, Pompey.	modern
So foolish sorrows bids your stones farewell.	shakespearean
An there be any matter of weight chances, call up me.	shakespearean
Come here, Sir Seacole.	modern
The rate— Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?	shakespearean
But she loves it so much (since Othello told her she should always keep it with her) that she always keeps it near her to kiss it and talk to it.	modern
Tis even so.	shakespearean
I thank you, gentle uncle.	shakespearean
But not for long; Charles will take care of everything.	modern
But is there no sequel at the heels of this mother’s admiration?	shakespearean
Have all your conquests, glories, triumphs, achievements, come to so little?	modern

My king says this: “Tell Harry of England: though we appeared dead, we were only asleep.	modern
Oh no, not if you say it right.	modern
What, keep a week away?	shakespearean
What was he, sad or merry?	shakespearean
What need you five and twenty, ten, or five To follow in a house where twice so many Have a command to tend you?	shakespearean
I’ve always had great respect for your destiny.	modern
I believe you, and I ask you to forgive me.	modern
I’ll do it with all my heart.	modern
A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say “Wit, whither wilt?”  Nay, you might keep that check for it, till you met your wife’s wit going to your neighbor’s bed.	shakespearean
Hush, Grumio.	modern
I don’t know, except they are busy with some phony guarantee.	modern
By day and night he wrongs me.	shakespearean
If I know nothing about pity, that must mean I’m not an animal.	modern
Now, let it work.	modern
It’s amazing, if I may say so, that she let herself be tamed.	modern
Go up there and second his petition.	modern
And her sister’s dead too, poisoned by your wife.	modern
He wants to be crowned.	modern
She speaks.	shakespearean
This is how God forces wicked men to turn their swords against themselves.	modern
But I don’t think it’ll hurt him to tell the truth.	modern
Dear gods, bless this couple, since you’re the ones who have shown us the path that led us here.	modern
But for a fine, quaint, graceful, and excellent fashion, yours is worth ten on ’t.	shakespearean
Oh, be quiet.	modern
Lysander I want to stop, but Hermia stops my heart from beating.	modern
Was he not companion with the riotous knights That tend upon my father?	shakespearean
Now heaven help him!	shakespearean
He taught me how to know a man in love, in which cage of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.	shakespearean
Come, father, I’ll leave you at a friend’s house.	modern
I wish I had a fault like that!	modern
O Jupiter, how weary are my spirits!	shakespearean
Fare you well.	shakespearean
And in good time, Here comes Sir Richard Ratcliffe and the duke.	shakespearean
Your words are idiotic.	modern
You know that I used to believe in Epicurus and his disregard for omens.	modern
When you sued staying, Then was the time for words.	shakespearean
Is he not here?	shakespearean
I wish your loyalty were as foolish.	modern
Then we’ll see that tomorrow night.	modern
Nay, but, Ophelia— Pray you, mark.	shakespearean
Stop—if you can’t be kind, at least have some shame.	modern
Here’s a change indeed!	shakespearean
And then came Pyramus.	shakespearean
Stillness and nighttime are perfect for beautiful music.	modern
And now they’re both gone.	modern
How much better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping!	shakespearean
Would you praise Caesar, say “Caesar.” Go no further.	shakespearean
As proper men as ever trod upon neat’s leather have gone upon my handiwork.	shakespearean
Alas, sir, it is worse for me than so, For I have bills for money by exchange From Florence, and must here deliver them.	shakespearean
Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil.	shakespearean
I cannot go to, man, nor ’tis not very well.	shakespearean
God forbid he wants to challenge me!	modern
I talked with no man at that hour, my lord.	shakespearean
I’m reluctant to tell you what I wish you knew.	modern
We must incline to the king.	shakespearean
Also, he’s left you all his walkways—in his private gardens and newly planted orchards—on this side of the Tiber River.	modern
Are you our daughter?	shakespearean
He can sniff his way to Dover.	modern
Why, for that too.	shakespearean
We have to give up and let him go.	modern
Hey, if I lay down my “ Welcome, Lorenzo and Salerio.	modern
Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill With sorrowful water?	shakespearean
But look, Cassius, Caesar looks angry and everyone else looks as if they’ve been scolded.	modern
Neighbors and friends, though bride and bridegroom wants For to supply the places at the table, You know there wants no junkets at the feast.	shakespearean
When I presented Ceres, I thought to have told thee of it, but I feared Lest I might anger thee.	shakespearean
You’ve said it, friend, and farewell to you.	modern
If it pleases your Majesty, it is the token of a man I must fight with, if he’s still alive.	modern
This contract doesn’t give you any blood at all.	modern
Fare you well, sir.	shakespearean
I’m watching the play.	modern
Yes, Casca.	modern
Oh, on my soul, my cousin has been slandered falsely!	modern
So, if they die unprepared, the king is no more guilty of their damnation than he was guilty of the earlier crimes they’re finally being punished for.	modern
I could drown the world.	modern
When should the royal day be?	modern
He just said that they’re no good at acting.	modern
My brother whom—aside from you—I loved more than anyone else in the world, I trusted to run my state, which at that time was the strongest in the land, and Prospero the number one duke, famous for my dignity and my education.	modern
Well, go thy way.	shakespearean
They’re murdering Caesar!” Who’s there?	modern
It doesn’t excuse your cruel behavior.	modern
Yes, on his front.	modern
But fare you well.	shakespearean
I know no answer.	shakespearean
What is the name of the castle that stands over there?	modern
My God, I’m the highest-ranking person who speaks this language—if only we were back where it’s spoken.	modern
Goodbye, sir.	modern
An unauthorized kiss!	shakespearean
Not so, neither.	shakespearean
A governor shines as brightly as a king until a king is near by, and the governor suddenly looks like a nobody.	modern
So, where’s my wife?	modern
Here is my bed.	shakespearean
Hush, Hortensio.	modern
It were a tedious difficulty, I think, To bring them to that prospect.	shakespearean
No, not until we see a hot January.	modern
For do but stand upon the foaming shore, The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds, The wind-shaked surge, with high and monstrous mane, Seems to cast water on the burning bear, And quench the guards of th' ever-fixèd pole.	shakespearean
I have but with a cursitory eye O'erglanced the articles.	shakespearean
You’re bleeding a lot.	modern
What stature is she of?	shakespearean
Yes, if it doesn’t stand still.	modern
Did you find my daughter?	modern
At a word, I am not.	shakespearean
Are my deserts no better?	shakespearean
And Cassio killed!	shakespearean
For this relief much thanks.	shakespearean
Speak, Count, ’tis your cue.	shakespearean
If you shall cleave to my consent, when ’tis, It shall make honor for you.	shakespearean
They drink Danes under the table, and it takes them no effort at all to out-drink Germans.	modern
Quiet there!	modern
Stop it, Marcellus.	shakespearean
Whenever he talks about her he can’t stop laughing.	modern
An he should, it were an alms to hang him.	shakespearean
Oh, come on.—Come here, sir.	modern
God has given you one face and you make yourselves another.	shakespearean
Shall we get to work?	modern
I never saw an action of such shame.	shakespearean
Thank you, my noble lord.	modern
For charitable prayers Shards, flints and pebbles should be thrown on her.	shakespearean
If she refuses my proposal, I’ll tell her how much I’m looking forward to the announcement and the wedding.	modern
And you by land.	shakespearean
And these does she apply for warnings and portents And evils imminent, and on her knee Hath begged that I will stay at home today.	shakespearean
As a favor to  Nope.	modern
No, it is struck.	shakespearean
Oh, why rebuke you him that loves you so?	shakespearean
That’s right.	modern
The pale companion is not for our pomp.	shakespearean
Is he arrayed?	shakespearean
We’re off, Biondello.	modern
What I deserve is that you treat me like a queen, and what you deserve is to act like my subjects.	modern
My lord, upon the platform where we watch.	shakespearean
Lend me a looking-glass.	shakespearean
Come, mistress Kate, I’ll join you.	modern
Dear Duff, I prithee, contradict thyself, And say it is not so.	shakespearean
My servants might overhear, and old Gremio is still hanging around, so we might be interrupted.	modern
I’ll do whatever the king wants.	modern
I warrant something from Venice.	shakespearean
That is the way to make her scorn you still.	shakespearean
Now he’ll outstare the lightning.	shakespearean
His horse is better than the Neapolitan’s and he frowns more than the Count Palatine.	modern
You might just as well say, “That’s a valiant flea that dares to eat its breakfast on the lip of a lion.” Yes, exactly.	modern
They are louder than the weather or our office.	shakespearean
When I do name him, let it be thy part To praise him more than ever man did merit.	shakespearean
What a storm!	modern
Therefore know I have earned of Don John a thousand ducats.	shakespearean
Why, get you gone!	shakespearean
She thanked me and told me that if a friend of mine had a story like mine to tell, she’d fall in love with him.	modern
This is a small house.	modern
Great and increasing.	shakespearean
Yes, sir.	modern
Is she really that wonderful?	modern
O’er my spirit Thy full supremacy thou knew’st, and that Thy beck might from the bidding of the gods Command me.	shakespearean
The wildest hath not such a heart as you.	shakespearean
O me!	shakespearean
Thus we are agreed.	shakespearean
Just obey me a little bit longer.	modern
Draw thy sword and give me Sufficing strokes for death.	shakespearean
Cassio, how did you get my wife’s handkerchief?	modern
Say it, Othello.	shakespearean
He, of all the men that ever my foolish eyes looked upon, was the best deserving a fair lady.	shakespearean
I’ll about And drive away the vulgar from the streets.	shakespearean
Now go, set up for dinner.	modern
Let him alone, for I remember now How he’s employed.	shakespearean
He is worth no more than that.	modern
Who can blot that name With any just reproach?	shakespearean
We must remember the gravity of this sad day.	modern
Flat burglary as ever was committed.	shakespearean
O my Christian ducats!	shakespearean
Is he pursued?	shakespearean
Content with Hermia?	shakespearean
If you hadn’t been their father, your white hair would have inspired in them only compassion.	modern
In cash.	modern
Hark, Tranio!	shakespearean
We’ll meet you at sea.	modern
See how beastly she doth court him!	shakespearean
Indeed, before he fell down, when he realized the commoners were glad he refused the crown, he pulled open his robe and offered them his throat to cut.	modern
She picks it up quick, doesn’t she?	modern
This business is well ended.	shakespearean
But please don’t let any of your people wake me up.	modern
Shall we shog?	shakespearean
With no more ceremony than that?	modern
What do you think about him, Cassio?	modern
How now, my lord!	shakespearean
Who’s gone this morning?	shakespearean
You’ll never hear from the herald again.	modern
Give ear, sir, to my sister.	shakespearean
How much I had to do to calm his rage!	shakespearean
My fault, but not my body, pardon, sovereign.	shakespearean
She was too attached to her filthy marriage ever to do a thing like that!	modern
Tush, I may as well say the fool’s the fool.	shakespearean
You have to pretend to be your niece’s father, and give her away to Claudio.	modern
Do you see yonder cloud that’s almost in shape of a camel?	shakespearean
Your answer, sir, is enigmatical.	shakespearean
I have heard him read many lectures against it, and I thank God I am not a woman, to be touched with so many giddy offenses as he hath generally taxed their whole sex withal.	shakespearean
Whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself And you of her, the bloody book of law You shall yourself read in the bitter letter, After your own sense, yea, though our proper son Stood in your action.	shakespearean
Farewell till then.	shakespearean
How does my royal lord?	shakespearean
Would all were well—but that will never be.	shakespearean
Oh, that woman that cannot make her fault her husband’s occasion, let her never nurse her child herself, for she will breed it like a fool.	shakespearean
She hath the stones upon her, and the ducats.” Why, all the boys in Venice follow him, Crying, “His stones, his daughter, and his ducats!”	shakespearean
I’ll tell him right away, my lord.	modern
Then he is dead?	shakespearean
A soldier is just a tool, like his sword, unless he has your qualities, Ventidius.	modern
O, quicken them with thine!	shakespearean
This is for your master’s sake, not mine.	modern
The violet smells to him the same as it does to me.	modern
In Venice they do let God see the pranks They dare not show their husbands.	shakespearean
Where is gentle Rivers, Vaughan, Grey?	shakespearean
Where is that messenger?	modern
Don’t say that.	modern
Why, then, take no note of him, but let him go and presently call the rest of the watch together and thank God you are rid of a knave.	shakespearean
I’m going far enough that I’ll be riding from now until dinner.	modern
The evil that men do lives after them; The good is oft interrèd with their bones.	shakespearean
And another storm brewing, I hear it sing i' th' wind.	shakespearean
But this is most falliable, the worm’s an odd worm.	shakespearean
Catesby, o'erlook the walls.	shakespearean
Come on, Iago.	modern
The sun is high, and we outwear the day.	shakespearean
My God, do you think I’m easier to manipulate than a pipe?	modern
Ay, but their sense is shut.	shakespearean
As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed.	shakespearean
I wish I could keep killing him for nine years straight.	modern
As long as heaven and nature lengthens it.	shakespearean
You may tell every finger I have with my ribs.	shakespearean
It shall be done, my lord.	shakespearean
Oh, Corin, I wish you could understand how much I love her!	modern
Now she holds me not.	shakespearean
I’ll go back to sleep now.	modern
Y' have ungently, Brutus, Stole from my bed.	shakespearean
One woe doth tread upon another’s heel, So fast they follow.—Your sister’s drowned, Laertes.	shakespearean
Hurry up.	modern
But brother Anthony— Don’t, it’s no big deal.	modern
Notwithstanding, use your pleasure.	shakespearean
All this fighting is because of you.	modern
And you all know, security Is mortals' chiefest enemy.	shakespearean
Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?	shakespearean
But truly, if I were as	modern
He swore that he’d never get married, but now, despite his earlier protestations, he loves ungrudgingly.	modern
We need some oracle to tell us what’s going on.	modern
Yes, sir, he’s here at the door right now and asks to see you.	modern
A tailor made thee.	shakespearean
You lowlife son-of-a-bitch!	modern
His better doth not breathe upon the earth.	shakespearean
After a little time, I’ll beat him too.	shakespearean
But Caesar ignores offers that don’t give him an advantage, and so should you.	modern
You certainly made me believe you did, my lord.	modern
God-a-mercy, Grumio!	shakespearean
It were an honest action to say So to the Moor.	shakespearean
Go put on thy defenses.	shakespearean
What we do we have been commanded to do.	modern
I’m not Cinna the conspirator.	modern
If I told them about this back in Naples, would they believe me?	modern
Now, in good sadness, son Petruchio, I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all.	shakespearean
As I am an honest man, he looks pale.—Art thou sick, or angry?	shakespearean
Confusion now hath made his masterpiece.	shakespearean
The concavities of it is not sufficient, for, look you, th' athversary, you may discuss unto the duke, look you, is digt himself four yard under the countermines.	shakespearean
Where hast thou sent the king?	shakespearean
Fut, I should have been that I am, had the maidenliest star in the firmament twinkled on my bastardizing.	shakespearean
Prince Dauphin, you shall stay with us in Rouen.	shakespearean
Here, madam.	modern
You’re in a good mood tonight, my lord.	modern
This is not the time for dwelling on personal grievances.	modern
My charity is outrage, life my shame, And in that shame still live my sorrows' rage.	shakespearean
I give them with this ring, Which when you part from, lose, or give away, Let it presage the ruin of your love	shakespearean
Who’s here?	shakespearean
Come here, good Volumnius.	modern
Now, my lord, what shall we do, if we perceive Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots?	shakespearean
Know of your youth.	shakespearean
His youngest daughter, the beautiful Bianca, is the jewel of my life, and he keeps her hidden away from me and other rivals for her hand.	modern
It was some devil.	modern
I remember the story.	shakespearean
I’d be wasting my skills dealing with an idiot like that if I couldn’t get something useful out of him.	modern
Tranio, you jest.	shakespearean
As freely, son, as God gave her to me.	modern
And is not the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man?	shakespearean
I really think it was him.	modern
Gracious brother, I will go with them.	modern
Rebellious dead, rise never till the wood Of Birnam rise, and our high-placed Macbeth Shall live the lease of nature, pay his breath To time and mortal custom.	shakespearean
Since your woes are only a portion of mine, I have every reason to surpass your lamentations and drown out your cries with my own.	modern
Nor I.	shakespearean
What income, what profit does it bring in?	modern
We’ll wait upon your lordship.	shakespearean
I’m tired of it, and you say you’re tired of it too.	modern
Make the best use of this information you can.	modern
This, and Saint George to boot—What think’st thou, Norfolk?	shakespearean
I won’t answer that.	modern
Indeed, my lord, he is a perfectly wonderful horse.	modern
Tell her.	modern
Life’s better at	modern
When I have plucked thy rose I cannot give it vital growth again, It must needs wither.	shakespearean
I see the downfall of my family.	modern
I know you know something— Thanks for the compliment, I’m happy you know that.	modern
Not so, not so.	shakespearean
I may not, madam.	shakespearean
The trumpery in my house, go bring it hither For stale to catch these thieves.	shakespearean
Fear you not my part of the dialogue.	shakespearean
I say that I love you more than he does.	modern
We had much more monstrous matter of feast, which worthily deserved noting.	shakespearean
Shame, and eternal shame, nothing but shame!	shakespearean
So you may put a man in your belly.	shakespearean
Lieutenant, I think you know I’m your friend.	modern
What should I call you when you’re a man?	modern
And even though you know I’m very close to the Prince and Claudio, I swear I’ll keep your counsel and deal with this secretly and justly.	modern
You should know, my friends, that I have good hopes for tomorrow, and that I will lead you as if I expect victory rather than an honorable death.	modern
Yea, Richard, when I know, for I protest As yet I do not.	shakespearean
I have them ready.	shakespearean
Nay, then.	shakespearean
But please, tell me the worst thing that could happen to me if I refuse to marry Demetrius.	modern
Tedious it were to tell and harsh to hear.	shakespearean
I’m your advocate, and I’d rather die than give up on you.	modern
I wouldn’t want a heart like hers even if you made me queen.	modern
Give us a smile.	modern
And, you know, his means, If he improve them, may well stretch so far As to annoy us all; which to prevent, Let Antony and Caesar fall together.	shakespearean
Thence we looked toward England And cited up a thousand fearful times, During the wars of York and Lancaster That had befall'n us.	shakespearean
O my daughter, Fled with a Christian!	shakespearean
Who must hang them?	shakespearean
But I pray you, ergo, old man, ergo, I beseech you, talk you of young Master Launcelot?	shakespearean
Which way hast thou been?	shakespearean
Can I bear that with patience, And not my husband’s secrets?	shakespearean
I cry your worships' mercy, heartily.—I beseech your worship’s name.	shakespearean
Thank you for asking, uncle.	modern
I think ’twas Soto that your Honor means.	shakespearean
If there’s any reason we shouldn’t get married, I urge you to tell me.	modern
But first I’ll turn yon fellow in his grave And then return lamenting to my love.	shakespearean
Better late than never—and it’s never too late to change.	modern
He is of a very melancholy disposition.	shakespearean
Good afternoon, good gentleman.	modern
This ring, sir—oh no, it’s nothing.	modern
What, man, ’tis a night of revels!	shakespearean
Give her the right you should have given her cousin, And so dies my revenge.	shakespearean
I’d feel sorry for them, if I were human.	modern
Then you must take the truth I have to tell like a Roman.	modern
Struggling with the wind and rain.	modern
Where’s my fool?—Go call my fool and have him come here.	modern
What life is in that to be the death of this marriage?	shakespearean
Fool, do not flatter yourself.	modern
Listen to me patiently.	modern
I served Mark Antony, who was the commander most worthy of my services.	modern
What in the world do you call this, tailor!	modern
Then bring me to their sights.	shakespearean
I’m happy to say “amen” to that!	modern
That’ll happen soon enough.	modern
I saw her, but I didn’t notice her.	modern
Antony would easily outshine all imaginary beings.	modern
He is unqualitied with very shame.	shakespearean
I thank you for your pains and courtesy.	shakespearean
Sitting on a bank, Weeping again the king my father’s wrack, This music crept by me upon the waters, Allaying both their fury and my passion With its sweet air.	shakespearean
Let me go.	shakespearean
And yet she’ll kneel and pray, I have seen her do ’t.	shakespearean
Oh, there’s been a lot of quarreling.	modern
Who did it?	modern
I’ll tear her all to pieces!	shakespearean
Here’s the place.	shakespearean
Even this repays me.— We sent our schoolmaster.	shakespearean
The more I hate, the more he follows me.	shakespearean
Come, one for me.	shakespearean
He was like that time of year halfway between the extremes of hot and cold: he was neither sad nor happy.	modern
By any other house or person?	shakespearean
Where is he now?	shakespearean
I’ll go to the Antipodes for any little errand you can think of.	modern
He waxes desperate with imagination.	shakespearean
I held the sword and he did run on it.	shakespearean
Carry him away.	modern
Do you carry a pike?	modern
Go we to him.	shakespearean
Who’s winning?	modern
Yes, my lord.	modern
This is a devil, and no monster.	shakespearean
I’d be peering over maps to figure out the best ports, piers, and waterways.	modern
What are you?	shakespearean
But two men complimenting each other is like two baboons getting together.	modern
If you can prove that I’ll ever be so in love that I can’t be brought to my senses with a good round of beers, you can pluck out my eyes with a love-poet’s pen and hang me on a brothel’s door where the picture of blind Cupid usually goes.	modern
Only foul words, and thereupon I will kiss thee.	shakespearean
Come, sisters, let’s cheer him up and show him our talents.	modern
The devil take order now!	shakespearean
He has called for his horse, but I don’t know where he’s headed.	modern
You stopped me.	modern
But though I was born here and should consider that tradition part of my own heritage, I think it would be better to ignore it than practice it.	modern
Or else it stood upon the choice of friends— O hell, to choose love by another’s eyes!	shakespearean
Many former friends of ours have gathered to meet the fleet and aren’t willing to beat it back.	modern
It was carried to Colmekill to be placed in the tomb of his ancestors, where their bones are kept safe.	modern
He wouldn’t say that.	modern
And they thought Margaret was Hero?	modern
I explained how you were deceived, how you were thwarted, the things that were used against you, who was working against you, and a lot of other things that would convince even a half-wit or a crazy person to say, “Banquo did it!” You explained it all.	modern
He’s starving me to death.	modern
Did you say with Cassio?	shakespearean
He is an animal worthy of Perseus.	modern
Now civil wounds are stopped, peace lives again.	shakespearean
Well, as you guess?	shakespearean
Go sleep, and hear us.	shakespearean
We did a lot of drinking in Egypt.	modern
Here’s another More potent than the first.	shakespearean
But hollow men, like horses hot at hand, Make gallant show and promise of their mettle.	shakespearean
And a goose for his discretion.	shakespearean
If the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most prepost'rous conclusions.	shakespearean
Against all rules of nature, and must be driven To find out practices of cunning hell Why this should be.	shakespearean
What news do you bring?	modern
Truly, young gentlemen, though there was no great matter in the ditty, yet the note was very untunable.	shakespearean
It were pity to cast them away for nothing, though between them and a great cause they should be esteemed nothing.	shakespearean
He was the wretched’st thing when he was young, So long a-growing and so leisurely, That if this rule were true, he should be gracious.	shakespearean
Give a quick example.	modern
To business that we love we rise betimes And go to ’t with delight.	shakespearean
Whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend.	shakespearean
And sometime lurk I in a gossip’s bowl In very likeness of a roasted crab, And when she drinks, against her lips I bob And on her withered dewlap pour the ale.	shakespearean
I go.	shakespearean
No more of these thoughts.	modern
What hast thou to do?— Father, be quiet.	shakespearean
She says all the right things, but the dumbest brothel-keeper would tell the same story.	modern
I pray you, sir, take patience.	shakespearean
Trust me, I am glad on ’t.	shakespearean
I’m telling you to make a fist and pound.	modern
Oh, my handsome nephew, I must not say that.	modern
He’d better not speak badly of Brutus here.	modern
No, pray thee, good Meg, I’ll wear this.	shakespearean
That’s for sure.	modern
Is ’t possible?	shakespearean
Thank you kindly, sir.	modern
She had a prophesying fear Of what hath come to pass.	shakespearean
It may be I shall raise you by and by On business to my brother Cassius.	shakespearean
What needs more words?	shakespearean
Therein the patient Must minister to himself.	shakespearean
Ay, madam.	shakespearean
Go tell the hunters to blow their horns and wake them up.	modern
I will speak daggers to her but use none.	shakespearean
Now everyone be seated, as this is the part where we sit and chat as well as eat.	modern
Iras, I won’t see you again for a long time.	modern
You’ve done well at sea.	modern
I have a bad cold that’s bothering me.	modern
And when a wise man gives you better advice than I just did, give me my advice back again.	modern
I long to hear him call the drunkard “husband,” And how my men will stay themselves from laughter When they do homage to this simple peasant.	shakespearean
We looked not for Mark Antony here.	shakespearean
That Petruchio came?	shakespearean
The skies, the fountains, every region near Seemed all one mutual cry.	shakespearean
How I have thought of this and of these times I shall recount hereafter.	shakespearean
I’m going to make sure I stay on your good side, lady.	modern
What comfortable hour canst thou name, That ever graced me in thy company?	shakespearean
Hath put himself from rest, And must needs taste his folly.	shakespearean
A good swift simile, but something currish.	shakespearean
I had a wound here that was like a “T,” But now ’tis made an “H.”                                                        They do retire.	shakespearean
Ay, my lord.	shakespearean
Why he more than another?	shakespearean
Ha, ha, heard in Genoa.	shakespearean
He certainly is.	modern
Now, I’m very pleased with it being outdoors, but in its not being at the court, it is boring.	modern
He has his moods and his ways.	modern
So may it be indeed.	shakespearean
Bring out the stocks!	modern
I can keep honest counsel, ride, run, mar a curious tale in telling it, and deliver a plain message bluntly.	shakespearean
But I won’t sleep till I get back.	modern
He’s a good soldier too, lady.	modern
What looks like a horse is quick as thought disfigured by the wind, made as difficult to distinguish as water poured into water.	modern
Should you do so, my lord, My speech should fall into such vile success Which my thoughts aimed not at.	shakespearean
Let but the commons hear this testament— Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read— And they would go and kiss dead Caesar’s wounds And dip their napkins in his sacred blood, Yea, beg a hair of him for memory, And, dying, mention it within their wills, Bequeathing it as a rich legacy Unto their issue.	shakespearean
Our closest relatives are the ones most likely to murder us.	modern
That would hang us, every mother’s son.	shakespearean
You won’t enjoy it much, I can tell you, the odds are so against this young man.	modern
I will tell you why.	shakespearean
Please you, farther.	shakespearean
Well then, you must be in love.	modern
And here’s Regan, whose grotesque face betrays her twisted heart.	modern
Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard, Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey.	shakespearean
Lead, monster; we’ll follow.	shakespearean
When I tried desperately to question them further, they vanished into thin air.	modern
Be a careful mother, madam, and think about your son, the young prince.	modern
Whither are they vanished?	shakespearean
If such a one be fit to govern, speak.	shakespearean
What do you think about this change?	modern
You shall advise me in everything having to do with Cleopatra.	modern
I don’t think so.	modern
Go, one of you, find out the forester.	shakespearean
Heaven make thee free of it.	shakespearean
And I for no woman.	shakespearean
Why, do not your courtier’s hands sweat?	shakespearean
You just said all your lines at once, cues and all.—Pyramus, enter.	modern
Who’s there, aside from this foul weather?	modern
Now he begins the story.	shakespearean
For more important things, you’ll say no.	modern
Only in the world I fill up a place which may be better supplied when I have made it empty.	shakespearean
This is the penthouse under which Lorenzo Desired us to make stand.	shakespearean
Pardon me, but I’m just repeating what you yourself have said.	modern
Then you and I and all of us fell down, while bloody treason triumphed.	modern
Tell me, you villainous lowlife, where are my children?	modern
You go to seek the Lord Hamlet.	shakespearean
Nearest his heart.”—Those are the very words.	modern
Oh, shut up!	modern
I don’t care if you love me or not, I like the cap and I’ll have it or I won’t have any.	modern
Was a man ever as dirty as me?	modern
Right joyous are we to behold your face, Most worthy brother England.	shakespearean
What, would you have me beg for my food?	modern
So here’s the plan.	modern
Even as men wracked upon a sand, that look to be washed off the next tide.	shakespearean
He cannot be heard of.	shakespearean
I know you are no truant.	shakespearean
Villain, thou know’st not law of God nor man.	shakespearean
I’ve been practicing fencing constantly since he went off to France.	modern
If he do resist, Subdue him at his peril!	shakespearean
Why don’t you go away for a bit?	modern
Will you give thanks, sweet Kate, or else shall I?— What’s this?	shakespearean
I wish you well.	modern
Fine, thank you.	modern
Here, sir, as foolish as ever.	modern
I know you’ll offer nothing less than that.	modern
No, I’ll recite it for you right now: “de hand, de fangres, de nails—” “De nails,” madame.	modern
Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.	shakespearean
Why, so didst thou.	shakespearean
I’ve got something for you.	modern
Tell them to capture me, then sell my bones.	modern
I never gave him any.	shakespearean
Can you tell me whether Rosalind, Duke Senior’s daughter, has also been banished?	modern
Why are you so pale?	modern
Is it not past two o'clock?	shakespearean
He will keep that good name still.	shakespearean
Your name, sir, truly.	shakespearean
Three proper young men of excellent growth and presence.	shakespearean
Those cowardly, gigantic sides of beef have been responsible for many of your family members getting eaten as a condiment on beef.	modern
So is my horse, Octavius, and for that reason I give him all the hay he wants.	modern
This is too long.	shakespearean
I wonder what it bodes.	shakespearean
He is welcome hither.	shakespearean
I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man swear he loves me.	shakespearean
This is the day wherein I wished to fall By the false faith of him who most I trusted.	shakespearean
I don’t have to give you answers that you like.	modern
What do you want?	modern
Oh, my heart bleeds To think o' th' teen that I have turned you to, Which is from my remembrance!	shakespearean
What worries have kept you awake tonight?	modern
You can’t tell a story simply when it’s a lie.	modern
The reason why the seven stars are no more than seven is a pretty reason.	shakespearean
Come, let’s do so.	shakespearean
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio.	shakespearean
It is a tale Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing.	shakespearean
Heavenly powers, restore him!	shakespearean
I pray you, one of you question yond man, if he for gold will give us any food.	shakespearean
Don’t shed any blood, or cut less or more than exactly a pound of flesh.	modern
If you’re going to die, be quick about it so you can catch the king’s departing soul or follow him, like obedient subjects, to his new kingdom of endless night.	modern
Sir, I tell you that we are not.	modern
What’s going on between you two?	modern
I think the best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence, and discourse grow commendable in none only but parrots.	shakespearean
Octavius, I’m older than you are.	modern
Do, young sir.	shakespearean
Yes, making a big fuss.	modern
What, you?	modern
Pray you, no more of this.	shakespearean
You are a fishmonger.	shakespearean
He says they can do nothing in this kind.	shakespearean
Good night, good doctor.	shakespearean
Come, come, we know your meaning, brother Gloucester.	shakespearean
Cleopatra— Do you think there ever was, or could there ever be, a man such as the one I dreamed about?	modern
I am the very man— I’ll see that straight.	shakespearean
Fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as a Christian is?	shakespearean
What man dost thou dig it for?	shakespearean
Why not?	modern
Tis age that nourisheth.	shakespearean
What else?	modern
He has the wisdom to act bravely but also safely.	modern
What’s your gracious pleasure?	shakespearean
Read the will!	modern
I call them forth to credit her.	shakespearean
I swear— —each actor arrived on his ass.	modern
Ay, lord.	shakespearean
Grave sir, hail!	shakespearean
Vanish, or I shall give thee thy deserving, And blemish Caesar’s triumph.	shakespearean
If there are any, speak, for it is he whom I have offended.	modern
What’s he that wishes so?	shakespearean
What raiment will your Honor wear today?	shakespearean
Why, then, we kill all our women.	shakespearean
Yes, for three months.	modern
And they that are most gallèd with my folly, They most must laugh.	shakespearean
Bassanio, the best thing you can do is to keep living and write an epitaph for my gravestone.	modern
You may do whatever you want in the world.	modern
He had a kind of taste.—Well, my conscience says, “Launcelot, budge not.” “Budge!” says the fiend.	shakespearean
I will say as much to his face.	modern
I have an adventurous fairy who’ll go seek out the squirrel’s secret stash and get you some fresh nuts.	modern
Good morning, sweet Hero.	modern
My cousin means Signor Benedick of Padua.	shakespearean
On Fortune’s cap we are not the very button.	shakespearean
We hope your poison has worn off and this day shall transform all grievances and quarrels into friendship.	modern
Then I beat my drum, at which point they pricked up their ears and opened their eyes, looking around for the source of my music.	modern
When she takes a sip, I bob up against her lips and make her spill the drink all over her withered old neck.	modern
I’ll make you an example for the others to learn from.	modern
She said something she shouldn’t have said, I’m sure of that.	modern
Season your admiration for a while With an attent ear, till I may deliver, Upon the witness of these gentlemen, This marvel to you.	shakespearean
And so far blameless proves my enterprise, That I have 'nointed an Athenian’s eyes.	shakespearean
I see the business.	shakespearean
Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice.	shakespearean
Hear me, good madam.	shakespearean
Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires, Men so disordered, so debauched and bold That this our court, infected with their manners, Shows like a riotous inn.	shakespearean
That you did fear is done.	shakespearean
I remember when I was in love, I broke my sword on a stone, and told him to take that for coming at night to see Jane Smile.	modern
If you have me, you have me now at my worst; and if you have me, you’ll appreciate me better and better.	modern
There’s a great abatement of kindness appears as well in the general dependants as in the duke himself also, and your daughter.	shakespearean
Come on—kill me and brag about it!	modern
Dost thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion i' th' earth?	shakespearean
Which ring did you give away, my lord?	modern
And, my dear sister, as long as the winds are blowing and ships are sailing, let me hear from you—write.	modern
Don’t look so sour.	modern
Why, that’s my dainty Ariel singing now.	modern
You can have it then, your highness.	modern
You look angry.	modern
He had a thousand noses, Horns whelked and waved like the enragèd sea.	shakespearean
In the entire play, not one word is well-written, and not one of the actors is right for his part.	modern
We should profane the service of the dead To sing a requiem and such rest to her As to peace-parted souls.	shakespearean
You should say, “I sort of know him, but not well.	modern
I’ll halt after.	shakespearean
To tell the truth, though, I think the duke hasn’t lost a single man, except for one who will probably be executed for robbing a church, one Bardolph—I don’t know if your Majesty knows the man.	modern
Adieu, adieu, adieu.	shakespearean
And this our life, exempt from public haunt, Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks, Sermons in stones, and good in everything.	shakespearean
I will o'erlook thy paper.	shakespearean
I just want everything to be all right between you.	modern
Now be quiet.	modern
Ha, let me see.	shakespearean
But here’s the plan: our army will stay with us on the hills by the city.	modern
Good troth, you do me wrong, good sooth, you do, In such disdainful manner me to woo.	shakespearean
Fierce, fiery warriors fought in the clouds in the usual formations of war—ranks and squadrons—until the clouds drizzled blood onto the Capitol.	modern
Why do you ask?	modern
Come and get it!	modern
All that glisters is not gold— Often have you heard that told.	shakespearean
Who in the crowd is calling me?	modern
As woman’s love.	shakespearean
Strangle her in her bed, the same bed she’s contaminated.	modern
It shall go hard if “Cambio” go without her.	shakespearean
Don’t damn yourself.	modern
It’s a letter from my brother that I haven’t finished reading yet.	modern
Oh, ay.	shakespearean
O Fates, come, come, Cut thread and thrum.	shakespearean
He prays you to save his life.	shakespearean
How, how I pray you?	shakespearean
You are, and do not know ’t.	shakespearean
A touch, a touch, I do confess ’t.	shakespearean
Here Catesby comes again.	shakespearean
While we reason here, A royal battle might be won and lost.	shakespearean
What, my gracious lord?	shakespearean
That’s authority!	modern
And what art thou, thou idol ceremony?	shakespearean
What do you say?	modern
I’ll do it right away.	modern
Yes, return and tell me if your master looks well, because he was sick when he left.	modern
Every minute we expect more ships to arrive.	modern
Regret and everlasting shame sit on our helmets, mocking us.	modern
Remember your children as being sweeter than they actually were, and think of the man who killed them as worse than he is.	modern
We have, sir.	shakespearean
I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard, Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke, Fulfill your pleasure.	shakespearean
I will fetch up your goats, Audrey.	shakespearean
Oh, royal Caesar!	modern
The more fool you for betting on my loyalty.	modern
What should I say to you?	shakespearean
I know the hand.	shakespearean
Listen, Signor Bassanio, there’s nothing to worry about.	modern
There the grown serpent lies.	shakespearean
No, I’d rather be married to a skull with a bone in its mouth than to either of those men.	modern
I know not, madam.	shakespearean
And do you now strew flowers in his way That comes in triumph over Pompey’s blood?	shakespearean
I’m not staying here to argue anymore.	modern
His glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy, nor his offenses enforced for which he suffered death.	shakespearean
The nature of bad news infects the teller.	shakespearean
I am amazed and know not what to say.	shakespearean
strange that sheeps' guts should hale souls out of men’s bodies?	shakespearean
What do you say?	modern
See you soon.	modern
Your son is crazy.	modern
You shall be king.	shakespearean
I afeard of him!	shakespearean
Where’s thy drum?	shakespearean
This is as strange a maze as e'er men trod, And there is in this business more than nature Was ever conduct of.	shakespearean
Come on, do you think I can’t recognize you by your excellent wit?	modern
Is that you, Diomedes?	modern
Will we hear from you before bedtime, Catesby?	modern
But do not look for further recompense Than thine own gladness that thou art employed.	shakespearean
Music, hark.	shakespearean
Be aidant and remediate In the good man’s distress.	shakespearean
I shall do my friends no wrong, for I have none to lament me; the world no injury, for in it I have nothing.	shakespearean
We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.	shakespearean
Young budding virgin, fair and pure and sweet, where are you off to?	modern
And so am I revenged.—That would be scanned.	shakespearean
Not with salt tears.	shakespearean
Calm down, sir, please.	modern
You would have made me treat them like a tyrant.—I’m done, my lord.	modern
I’m off to visit my friends in Padua—particularly my best friend Hortensio.	modern
There’s no clock here in the forest.	modern
Don’t worry, I’ll be there.	modern
O ill-dispersing wind of misery!	shakespearean
Do you sing it, and I’ll dance it.	shakespearean
Give me up the truth.	shakespearean
They would else have been troubled with a pernicious suitor.	shakespearean
Mum, then, and no more.	shakespearean
Can you bring me to him?	modern
You shall do small respect, show too bold malice Against the grace and person of my master, Stocking his messenger.	shakespearean
For this time I will leave you.	shakespearean
The queen wants you to chat with Laertes—politely—before you begin your match.	modern
If you wish to speak of love, speak more softly.	modern
If this dream vision is typical of what this island conjures up, then I’ll lose my son twice.	modern
Against my will, I’ve been told to bring you in to dinner.	modern
I go, my lord.	shakespearean
He dies that strikes again.	shakespearean
But in spite of all this, the man is still wealthy enough.	modern
Nay, I have offered all, I have no more, And she can have no more than all I have.	shakespearean
Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?	shakespearean
I think it freely, and betimes in the morning I will beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me.	shakespearean
Their bloody sign of battle is hung out, And something to be done immediately.	shakespearean
Say something.	modern
That’s enough.	modern
And yet I still regret the anger that drove me to kill them.	modern
For the favor of sleeping in her bed.	modern
What, ho, Brabantio!	shakespearean
I say it’s the moon that shines so bright.	modern
Her name is Portia.	modern
There’s no art To find the mind’s construction in the face.	shakespearean
My comfort is that old age, that ill layer-up of beauty, can do no more spoil upon my face.	shakespearean
Why, what is that to you?	shakespearean
Though for myself alone I would not be ambitious in my wish To wish myself much better, yet for you I would be trebled twenty times myself— A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times more rich— That only to stand high in your account I might in virtue, beauties, livings, friends Exceed account.	shakespearean
Let this evil hour be marked forever in the calendar as cursed.	modern
Let me wipe it first.	shakespearean
Hope I may choose, sir.	shakespearean
How hath your lordship brooked imprisonment?	shakespearean
One of you run to the Queen with the news.	modern
Yes, my lord, I played the part of a gossip and brought him the news.	modern
We’ll hit him on the head with the handles of our swords, then throw him in the wine barrel in the next room.	modern
It’s a lot to ask of a maiden.	modern
Good morning, sir.	modern
Why should people like me be crawling around between earth and heaven?	modern
Count Claudio?	shakespearean
You have put him down, lady, you have put him down.	shakespearean
Nature took Helen’s  Cleopatra’s majesty, The best of Atalanta, And unhappy Lucretia’s modesty.	modern
A good matter, surely.	shakespearean
I know who you are.	modern
That’s true, lieutenant.	modern
You’re welcome, sir, and he for your good sake.	shakespearean
Be ’t as our gods will have ’t.	shakespearean
That’s a deal.	modern
I wrote to you When rioting in Alexandria.	shakespearean
What think’st thou?	shakespearean
Good-bye, son.	modern
His answer was, the people were not used To be spoke to but by the recorder.	shakespearean
Oh, you villain!	modern
Well, give me the worst news.	modern
Lepidus is red in the face.	modern
Thirty ships.	modern
You ought to be ashamed of yourself!	modern
Count the clock.	shakespearean
To hell with this idiot!	modern
Young man, have you challenged Charles the wrestler?	shakespearean
So I can sleep away the time while my Antony is gone.	modern
An honest tale speeds best being plainly told.	shakespearean
Before sunrise tomorrow, we’ll kill anyone who escaped today.	modern
And what irks me more than all these things put together is that he does it under the pretense of love—as though for me to eat or sleep would bring on fatal illness or sudden death.	modern
Then, by myself—      Thyself is self-misused.	shakespearean
I can’t promise that love won’t transform me, but I can promise you this: until I truly fall in love, a woman will never make me act like such a fool.	modern
The good years shall devour them, flesh and fell, Ere they shall make us weep.	shakespearean
Where do you live?	modern
But constant expression of wild grief will only make it tame, so I’m not going to say any more about my boys until I’ve gouged your eyes out with my bare hands.	modern
He’s busy, can’t you hear him giving orders?	modern
I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus, As well as I do know your outward favor.	shakespearean
It is with a good will.	shakespearean
And what art thou that dar’st Appear thus to us?	shakespearean
Yes, I do, sir.	modern
It won’t be long before I’m back.	modern
There is tears for his love, joy for his fortune, honor for his valor, and death for his ambition.	shakespearean
Oh, my bad luck has forced honest men to become traitors.	modern
Weapons, arms?	shakespearean
Who did strike out the light?	shakespearean
What serious contemplation are you in?	shakespearean
I assure you he can.	modern
Sing it.	shakespearean
Despair, and die!	shakespearean
Morton is fled to Richmond, And Buckingham, backed with the hardy Welshmen, Is in the field, and still his power increaseth.	shakespearean
Be quiet, you are Antonio.	modern
Doesn’t Benedick deserve as much luck with a mate as he would have with Beatrice?	modern
Tis hot, it smokes.	shakespearean
But soon I’ll see the gods punish you for your lack of respect to your father.	modern
Let him answer me.— Come, follow me, boy.	shakespearean
In bed with her?	modern
Observe how Antony becomes his flaw, And what thou think’st his very action speaks In every power that moves.	shakespearean
You knew that my sword, weakened by my love for you, would obey that love no matter what.	modern
No child but Hero; she’s his only heir.	shakespearean
How do you both plead?	modern
When are you married, madam?	shakespearean
Nay, come again, Good Kate.	shakespearean
Nay, that he did not.	shakespearean
You have simply misused our sex in your love-prate.	shakespearean
But his navy rules the sea.	modern
I know my nails are stronger than my eyes; I’ll scratch them out.	modern
Yes, by God!	modern
Seleucus’ ingratitude makes me wild.	modern
To serve me well, you all should do me duty: Teach me to be your queen, and you my subjects.	shakespearean
So call the field to rest, and let’s away To part the glories of this happy day.	shakespearean
Only this commendation I can afford her, that were she other than she is, she were unhandsome, and being no other but as she is, I do not like her.	shakespearean
Mark his condition and the event.	shakespearean
Therefore, hear me, Hermia.	shakespearean
Look, with a spot I damn him.	shakespearean
Why should he call her a whore?	modern
The alcohol that got the servants drunk has made me bold.	modern
I prithee, put them off.	shakespearean
Come talk to me about this.	modern
But stop, I say.	modern
What, shall one of us That struck the foremost man of all this world But for supporting robbers, shall we now Contaminate our fingers with base bribes, And sell the mighty space of our large honors For so much trash as may be graspèd thus?	shakespearean
You know why I think so?	modern
Come on, my lord.	modern
We had a little food and fresh water that a nobleman from Naples, Gonzalo, had given us out of the kindness of his heart.	modern
Why, how now, Adam?	shakespearean
The muffled queen”?	modern
And then he offered it the third time.	shakespearean
Shylock is my name.	shakespearean
If this isn’t what you’ve been hoping for, I have no more to say except that you ought to say goodbye to Bianca forever.	modern
He bids them good morning with a modest smile and calls	modern
And so adieu, sir.	shakespearean
Let’s pray that we never come into conflict like that again.	modern
Agree to swear.	modern
I had no reason, no reason.	modern
Yes, look, it’s true that children are punished for the sins of their fathers.	modern
Once there, make your thoughts work harder, and witness a siege.	modern
I your commission will forthwith dispatch, And he to England shall along with you.	shakespearean
I folded up the new document, signed it, sealed it, and put it safely back so that no one noticed any difference.	modern
He sent a messenger ahead of him who arrived here so out of breath that he could barely speak his message.	modern
That he was never trained as a soldier.	modern
Trail’st thou the puissant pike?	shakespearean
No, that’s not true.	modern
Not being the worst Stands in some rank of praise.	shakespearean
None but the fool, who labors to outjest His heart-struck injuries.	shakespearean
Hurry, go!	modern
Come, sire, no more.—What, Oswald, ho!	shakespearean
Bolstered by righteousness, I prepared to fight, and when he saw my excitement—or perhaps because my shouting scared him—he ran away suddenly.	modern
I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.	shakespearean
A man no mightier than thyself or me In personal action, yet prodigious grown, And fearful as these strange eruptions are.	shakespearean
I tell you, you’ve ruined her gown.	modern
Well, then, that’s the humor of ’t.	shakespearean
You shall not in your funeral speech blame us, But speak all good you can devise of Caesar, And say you do ’t by our permission.	shakespearean
You must translate.	shakespearean
Ready, my lord.	shakespearean
Don’t be cruel, Demetrius.	modern
The moon has set.	modern
When he comes back from hunting, I’m not going to speak to him.	modern
Oh, cut my bodice-staps so that my pent-up heart can have some room to breathe, or I’ll faint from this deadly news!	modern
To eat us hungerly, and when they are full, They belch us.	shakespearean
A rotten, foolish monster.	modern
If we happen to offend you, it’s because we want to.	modern
Most happy!	shakespearean
Sir, in Argier.	shakespearean
Adieu, Lest our old robes sit easier than our new!	shakespearean
Therefore this project	shakespearean
I’ll do it, but I don’t like it.	modern
Caesar speaks.	shakespearean
Do that, and I’ll set you free in two days.	modern
It looks better in a king than his own crown looks on him.	modern
Well, I’m nearly finished.	modern
To none but thee, no more but when to thee.	shakespearean
Do I look like a cudgel or a hovel-post, a staff or a prop?	shakespearean
You have no reason to say that.	modern
I’d rather overload my liver with wine than starve my heart by denying myself fun.	modern
My liege, your highness now may do me good.	shakespearean
Do so.	shakespearean
I’ll catch it before it falls to the ground.	modern
How is my noble lord?	modern
This repays me.	modern
Why hath thy queen Summoned me hither to this short-grassed green?	shakespearean
Your power and your command is taken off And Cassio rules in Cyprus.	shakespearean
Prithee, dispatch.	shakespearean
She’s the worse for all this.	shakespearean
The tunnels!	modern
I will not long be troubled with you.	shakespearean
I go.	shakespearean
What color is her hair?	modern
I’m tired of this moon.	modern
Sir, he may live.	shakespearean
The voice of Cassio.	shakespearean
No one’s heard from him.	modern
Your love’s name is Rosalind?	modern
In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker, but he!—why, he hath a horse better than the Neapolitan’s, a better bad habit of frowning than the Count Palatine.	shakespearean
Look at this man.	modern
Don’t talk to me.	modern
Well, I’ll be revenged as I may.	shakespearean
I know that my hour has come.	modern
Be patient, for the prize I’ll bring thee to Shall hoodwink this mischance.	shakespearean
It is not honesty in me to speak What I have seen and known.	shakespearean
Alexander, God knows and you know, in his rages and his furies and his wraths and his angers and his moods and his displeasures and his indignations, and also being a little the worse for drink, killed his best friend Cleitus in a drunken rage, see.	modern
Let go his arm.	shakespearean
Should we just get down to it?	modern
When your mind is at peace, your body is sensitive to the elements.	modern
For the heavens, rouse up a brave mind,” says the fiend, “and run.” Well, my conscience, hanging about the neck of my heart, says very wisely to me, “My honest friend Launcelot, being an honest man’s son”—or rather an honest woman’s son, for indeed my father did something smack, something grow to.	shakespearean
Why let it strike?	shakespearean
As long as hell and Richard likes of it.	shakespearean
The nine Muses mourning the death of learning and scholarship.” That’s some sharp, critical satire, and it’s not appropriate for a wedding.	modern
Pluck them asunder.	shakespearean
That I was disdainful and that I had my good wit out of The Hundred Merry Tales!	shakespearean
I hope that God restores you to health.	modern
It seemed she was a queen Over her passion, who, most rebel-like, Sought to be king o'er her.	shakespearean
Come on.	modern
Not the one I gave you, I hope.	modern
After midnight, for two nights running, these two guards, Marcellus and Barnardo, saw a figure that looked very much like your father, in full armor from head to toe.	modern
Convince him that he has been out of his mind—and when he says he’s out of his mind  My lord, I promise we will play our parts so skillfully that he will believe everything we tell him.	modern
Was he not here?	shakespearean
Listen a minute.	modern
Sir, that’s well said and well thought out.	modern
Do you speak in the sick tune?	shakespearean
Hang on, sir!	modern
But you have all the advantages from the harm done.	modern
Give me a goblet.—Hamlet, this pearl’s yours.	modern
It’s time we hit the road.	modern
I shall find time, Cassius, I shall find time.	shakespearean
Then there’s the Count Palatine.	modern
That’s what I said when I first conjured the tempest.	modern
Let me ask you a particular question.	modern
Leave me, Iago.	shakespearean
I will weep for thee, For this revolt of thine methinks is like Another fall of man.—Their faults are open.	shakespearean
Gentle Octavia, support the one that supports you.	modern
And a good soldier too, lady.	shakespearean
Some of this liquor’s still left in the goblet.	modern
I hear him mock The luck of Caesar, which the gods give men To excuse their after wrath.—Husband, I come!	shakespearean
Go with me and see What I can show in this.	shakespearean
Call Burgundy.—    Cornwall and Albany, With my two daughters' dowers digest this third.	shakespearean
You may really be honest, no matter what I think.	modern
I thought that thing you’re talking about was a man.	modern
If I say sooth, I must report they were As cannons overcharged with double cracks, So they doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe.	shakespearean
Hound or spaniel, bitch or dog, Whether your tail is short or curly— Tom will make you cry and wail.	modern
My wits begin to turn.—   Come on, my boy.	shakespearean
Where’s this so-called king?	modern
Tell him there’s a post come from my master with his horn full of good news.	shakespearean
There’s my cap.	shakespearean
Think like this all day, and you’ll learn how to curse.	modern
What’s going on, daughter?	modern
The night has been chaotic.	modern
I go over hills and valleys, through bushes and thorns, over parks and fenced-in spaces, through water and fire.	modern
Ay, mother, but I would not have it so.	shakespearean
Please, sir, restrain yourself.	modern
Go walk the path that you will never return from.	modern
But are they all safe, Ariel?	modern
But hush, no more.	shakespearean
Dear master, I can go no further.	shakespearean
Isn’t every living thing condemning her?	modern
Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.	shakespearean
It’s a long story—and tough to listen to.	modern
No, we can just announce the actor’s name, and let his face show through the lion costume, and have him say something himself.	modern
Yet if you there Did practice on my state, your being in Egypt Might be my question.	shakespearean
Good lieutenant, is your general married?	modern
If only to go warm were gorgeous, Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear’st, Which scarcely keeps thee warm.	shakespearean
I’m at your service, madam.	modern
And the ghost frowned just like the king did once when he attacked the Poles, traveling on the ice in sleds.	modern
Madam, bethink you, like a careful mother, Of the young prince your son.	shakespearean
You might as well try to stab the air with your sword.	modern
Because that’s what you are now.	modern
My purposes do draw me much about.	shakespearean
Now I’ll go inside and write out a secret order to keep Clarence’s brats out of sight and to forbid anyone whatsoever from seeing King Edward’s sons.	modern
If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.	shakespearean
Tell me.	modern
You said the enemy would not come down But keep the hills and upper regions.	shakespearean
In her consists my happiness and thine.	shakespearean
What a pretty thing man is when he goes in his doublet and hose and leaves off his wit!	shakespearean
So it’s nearly the time when the ghost likes to appear.	modern
Those that do teach young babes Do it with gentle means and easy tasks.	shakespearean
Yes, my good lord.	modern
Drown cats and blind puppies!	shakespearean
Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed, The air is delicate.	shakespearean
Your children were vexation to your youth, But mine shall be a comfort to your age.	shakespearean
And just for today, Oh, Lord, just today don’t think of the crime my father committed in seizing the crown!	modern
Love is such a violent emotion that it makes people self-destruct, as much as any strong emotion.	modern
Or, if you don’t mind, come to my home, and I’ll wait for you.	modern
Hang there on this tree, you lines of poetry, and bear witness to my love.	modern
He’s a devil, a born devil, who can never be trained.	modern
And does she have to die for this?	modern
Come out, beautiful sun—until I’ve bought a mirror to admire my reflection in, I’ll watch my shadow as I stroll along.	modern
It’s probably some noble gentleman stopping off in mid-journey, thinking to spend the night here.	modern
So will we all.	modern
He hath not touched you yet.	shakespearean
On what grounds?	modern
Let me still take away the harms I fear, Not fear still to be taken.	shakespearean
Get some light!	modern
Is that how the law sees it?	modern
If it had been painful, I would not have come.	shakespearean
So I to her and so she yields to me, For I am rough and woo not like a babe.	shakespearean
If I were king?	modern
Here he is.	modern
Where are you, keeper?	modern
No, don’t pause, because I	modern
Serve God, love me, and mend.	shakespearean
Here comes the man you mean.	shakespearean
Do you love me?	modern
Are these the wretches that we threw dice for?	modern
I have much to do But to go hang my head all at one side And sing it like poor Barbary.	shakespearean
Perchance till after Theseus' wedding day.	shakespearean
And whatsoever else shall hap tonight, Give it an understanding, but no tongue.	shakespearean
You’re not as close to death as you think you are.	modern
They let God see things they wouldn’t show their husbands.	modern
The sister of my wife, this lady here, is married to your son.	modern
The little dogs and all, Tray, Blanch, and Sweetheart—see, they bark at me.	shakespearean
Had you been as wise as bold, Young in limbs, in judgment old, Your answer had not been inscrolled.	shakespearean
Can it be possible that no one saw them leave?	modern
Help, angels.	shakespearean
After you harvest, you have to sheaf and bind So throw ripe Rosalind on the harvest cart.	modern
I don’t understand all dat.	modern
Hang on a second.	modern
No, I didn’t say that.	modern
I certainly did, and I never wanted to see you again.	modern
A better example—come on.	modern
This is what happens when you visit whores.	modern
Death of thy soul!	shakespearean
Oh, mischief has ruined our plans!	modern
They have dispatched with Pompey; he is gone.	shakespearean
Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear, The armed rhinoceros, or th' Hyrcan tiger; Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves Shall never tremble.	shakespearean
We must be patient, but I cannot choose but weep, to think they should lay him i' th' cold ground.	shakespearean
Here’s mine.	modern
Here comes the owner of one piece.	modern
So is the fame.	shakespearean
Your mind may change.	shakespearean
I had you figured for a piece of furniture.	modern
As you know, next Sunday my daughter Katherina is to be married.	modern
Though we have spent our harvest of this king, We are to reap the harvest of his son.	shakespearean
The king’s son, Ferdinand, with his hair standing straight up—it looked like reeds, not hair—was the first person to jump, shouting, “Hell is empty, and all the devils are here!” Good job!	modern
We wait upon your Grace.	shakespearean
Even for that our love of old, I prithee, Hold thou my sword hilts, whilst I run on it.	shakespearean
I hope heaven protects him from the weather, because I lost sight of him on the stormy sea.	modern
Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity In least speak most, to my capacity.	shakespearean
For with throwing thus my head,  Dogs leap the hatch, and all are fled.	shakespearean
And now, let’s turn to our business with the French.	modern
Are they married, think you?	shakespearean
Why, the he that will marry this woman.	modern
Since I was three years old, I’ve been in contact with a powerful but virtuous magician—no black magic here.	modern
Ariel, you’ve done your work exactly as I ordered.	modern
It’s almost four.	modern
I have so much care and pity for you that you could call me friend.	modern
I will be flesh and blood, For there was never yet philosopher That could endure the toothache patiently, However they have writ the style of gods And made a push at chance and sufferance.	shakespearean
He rejected my authority as much as yours.	modern
I got it from him.	modern
A truant disposition, good my lord.	shakespearean
Most heavy day!	shakespearean
As Edgar, I’m nothing at all.	modern
Come then and take the last warmth of my lips.	shakespearean
Oh ho, are you there with me?	shakespearean
And who is that?	modern
If you keep on the way you’ve been going, you’ll kill yourself.	modern
We’ll wait upon your lordship.	shakespearean
So white, and such a traitor?	shakespearean
Does it really make sense, once we divide the world into three parts, that he should be one of the three rulers?	modern
Yes, I was, but I don’t want an answer from you.	modern
Well sir, they’ve lied; moreover, they have said things that were not true; secondarily, they are slanderers; sixth and lastly, they have falsely accused a lady; thirdly, they have confirmed things that did not in fact happen; and, in conclusion, they are lying scoundrels.	modern
It’s true.	modern
I love him dearly, and I shall continue to favor him.	modern
Our preparation stands In expectation of them.	shakespearean
Nay, never lay thy hand upon thy sword.	shakespearean
I have it ready.	modern
Go to, mum, you are he.	shakespearean
What he will do with it Heaven knows, not I. I nothing but to please his fantasy.	shakespearean
He’s going senile.	modern
Behind the arras I’ll convey myself To hear the process.	shakespearean
So I am free.	shakespearean
That’s as good as proof that the sweet young man’s in love.	modern
Within these ten days if that thou beest found So near our public court as twenty miles, Thou diest for it.	shakespearean
He did ask for mercy.	modern
Good morrow, friends.	shakespearean
Now I say good night to your bones, Hero.	modern
Tell me, friend.	modern
I wish I’d been there.	modern
So take your last breath.	modern
I’ll write to my stepson Richmond on your behalf, so that he’ll meet you on the way.	modern
Trust me, I take him for the better dog.	shakespearean
We here attend you.	shakespearean
No, taking you away from your new marriage would be like showing a child a new coat and then not letting him wear it.	modern
Before I fall asleep, I entrust my soul to you.	modern
Have you the lion’s part written?	shakespearean
Can I have a word with you privately?	modern
The king falls from bias of nature—there’s father against child.	shakespearean
Tell us when you wish to get married, and may God give you joy.	modern
I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at my beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give them shape, or time to act them in.	shakespearean
Four nights will quickly dream away the time.	shakespearean
Oh yes—to smell  This is Signor Antonio.	modern
What villain touched his body, that did stab, And not for justice?	shakespearean
The leisure and the fearful time Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love And ample interchange of sweet discourse, Which so-long-sundered friends should dwell upon.	shakespearean
Kent’s been banished just like that?	modern
If you do, please give it to me, because I need to start learning the lines.	modern
Happily met, the happier for thy son.	shakespearean
Well, my good lord, I have informed them so.	shakespearean
But you don’t look as if you bring good news.	modern
Draw your sword, scoundrel.	modern
But, sir, be you ruled by me.	shakespearean
So all.	shakespearean
But Audrey, there’s a boy in the forest who claims you’re his girl.	modern
I hope you are pleased with the snake.	modern
How can they refuse to speak with me?	modern
I’m going to stand so I can see him pass on the way to the Capitol.	modern
He is a gentleman of a good family, and for his ransom, he will give you two hundred crowns.	modern
Hell and damnation!	modern
Ay, dread Queen.	shakespearean
Those of his chamber, as it seemed, had done ’t.	shakespearean
For standing up for this unpopular king.	modern
Well, explain—but do it fast so that your puny store of kindness isn’t used up by talking about it.	modern
Five hundred poor I have in yearly pay, Who twice a day their withered hands hold up Toward heaven to pardon blood.	shakespearean
When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me.	shakespearean
Oh, that’s disgusting!	modern
Yes, madam.	modern
And die in music.	shakespearean
Go to, away.	shakespearean
Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber.	shakespearean
She stood and spoke.	modern
If you like, Brakenbury, you can listen to anything we say.	modern
So far I’ve done exactly what I was supposed to do—I put the love potion on an Athenian’s eyes.	modern
No, you have to forget all that now.	modern
By Cheshu, he is an ass, as in the world.	shakespearean
Oh, he’s really gone.	modern
The king is coming here tonight.	modern
He knows that you embrace not Antony As you did love, but as you feared him.	shakespearean
I’m a carpenter, sir.	modern
Play some music while he chooses.	modern
He brushes his hat in the mornings.	modern
I’m sorry my noble brother is suspicious of me.	modern
I’ll be bitter toward him, and curt.	modern
Come on, tell me in broken music—for your voice is music and your English broken.	modern
Brutus” and “Caesar.” What’s so special about “Caesar”?	modern
I bet she’ll chew him out.	modern
You have enough holy feeling to advise me to “make peace with God,” but you’re willing to go to war with God by murdering me?	modern
The morning comes upon ’s.	shakespearean
For there was never yet fair woman but she made mouths    in a glass.	shakespearean
Soon we will toast around the table.	modern
Petruchio, stand by a while.	shakespearean
Should we now dirty our fingers with lowly bribes and sell the mighty offices that we hold for whatever money we can get our hands on?	modern
Ouch, what a comeback!	modern
That’s very strange.	modern
I’ve promised to make everything right.	modern
I am glad of it.	shakespearean
Oh, she tears that letter into a thousand small pieces and berates herself for being so forward as to write a letter to a man she knows would mock her.	modern
Let’s go, because it’s already after midnight, and we want him on our side before daylight.	modern
Epicurism and lust Make it more like a tavern or a brothel Than a graced palace.	shakespearean
Let’s have explicit contracts drawn up to ensure that both sides keep their promises.	modern
Under what title shall I woo for thee, That God, the law, my honor and her love Can make seem pleasing to her tender years?	shakespearean
Oh, sun, I will never see another one of your sunrises.	modern
What is the matter, my lord?	shakespearean
Honestly, she is too ill-tempered.	modern
He’s made me a Christian.	modern
Oh, my heart!	modern
You’re bothering me.	modern
I have undone three tailors.	shakespearean
Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?	shakespearean
It wants us to speak to it.	modern
Lysander, say something!	modern
What may she not?	shakespearean
Yes, and you dared Caesar to fight the battle at Pharsalia, where he fought against Pompey.	modern
I told you before, and I’ll tell you again and again: I hate the Moor.	modern
Touched you the bastardy of Edward’s children?	shakespearean
But let me place this wreath on your head.	modern
Shall I have the thought To think on this, and shall I lack the thought That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?	shakespearean
Perhaps  What, my love?	modern
There I have another bad match!—a bankrupt, a prodigal who dare scarce show his head on the Rialto, a beggar that was used to come so smug upon the mart.	shakespearean
I’ll sleep over here.	modern
My sovereign lord, I do beseech your Highness To take our brother Clarence to your grace.	shakespearean
Why, then, I care not for thee.	shakespearean
Realms and islands were As plates dropped from his pocket.	shakespearean
The foul fiend haunts Poor Tom in the voice of a nightingale.	shakespearean
Your head, my lord?	modern
Something he left imperfect in the state which, since his coming forth, is thought of; which imports to the kingdom so much fear and danger that his personal return was most required and necessary.	shakespearean
She’s the one who’s got to do it.	modern
Shame on you!	modern
Don’t leave me in the lurch.	modern
I know, prince.	modern
Get up, get up, and look at this image of doomsday!	modern
And I as I love Hastings with my heart.	shakespearean
Could my good brother suffer you to do it— A man, a prince by him so benefited?	shakespearean
I don’t like that.	modern
I thank thee for that gird, good Tranio.	shakespearean
My bones would rest, That have but labored to attain this hour.	shakespearean
Not if the minor ones come up first.	modern
What captain do you serve?	modern
I hope it doesn’t make me unchaste that I really want to be a married woman.	modern
If you will come to me— For now I spy a danger—I entreat you To bring but five and twenty.	shakespearean
Who’s calling me?	modern
I heard myself declared an outlaw and escaped capture by hiding in the trunk of a hollow tree.	modern
He shall taste of my bottle.	shakespearean
No, my lord, I saw nothing.	shakespearean
Yours, if you talk of tales.	shakespearean
The Egyptian flagship, the  Gods and goddesses—the whole congregation of them!	modern
I love her ten times more than e'er I did.	shakespearean
Hello, Tubal.	modern
I put it in the pocket of my nightgown.	modern
The king himself is rode to view their battle.	shakespearean
It’s easier to rule a third of the world than a wife like that.	modern
Whatever I say, or think, or do, you’re continually contradicting it.	modern
Darling Kate!	modern
I’ve got you now, pagan.	modern
No, I swear on my honor, I haven’t, madam.	modern
What, you look merrily.	shakespearean
sits.—I did never think that lady would have loved any man.	shakespearean
But such officers do the king best service in the end.	shakespearean
If true lovers are always thwarted, then it must be a rule of fate.	modern
Out of my sight!	shakespearean
If that’s true, it makes up for all the sorrows I’ve ever known.	modern
As for Michael Cassio, I think it would be safe for me to swear that he’s honest.	modern
All which we pine for now.	shakespearean
Come away.	shakespearean
Am I to be dictated to, like a child?	modern
I do not know.	shakespearean
I’ll challenge him.	modern
I’ll knock your teeth out, sir.	modern
Claudio, take my daughter, and, with her, take my fortunes.	modern
Cobble you, sir.	modern
So young, my lord, and honest.	modern
Still, did you notice how ready he was to hire good tutors for her?	modern
One word more Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee.	shakespearean
No, before!	modern
Why, ’tis good to be sad and say nothing.	shakespearean
When you avoid one trap, you fall into another.	modern
I know you not.	shakespearean
Come with me and let me advise you.	modern
By this scimitar That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince That won three fields of Sultan Solyman, I would o'erstare the sternest eyes that look, Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth, Pluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear, Yea, mock the lion when he roars for prey, To win the lady.	shakespearean
For love of God, forbear him.	shakespearean
Make no noise, make no noise.	shakespearean
What, my old worshipful old master?	shakespearean
He knows not the stop.	shakespearean
How now, my friend, why dost thou look so pale?	shakespearean
I have professed me thy friend, and I confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness.	shakespearean
I’ll read you a sermon.	modern
Which do not be entreated to, but weigh What it is worth embraced.	shakespearean
The other half comes to the general state, Which humbleness may drive unto a fine.	shakespearean
Today Pompey laughs away his fortune.	modern
I’m sorry to find you like this.	modern
O villain!	shakespearean
Who is most inward with the noble duke?	shakespearean
Excellent well.	shakespearean
Absolutely everything.	modern
O Sisters three, Come, come to me With hands as pale as milk.	shakespearean
But what a fool am I to chat with you, When I should bid good morrow to my bride And seal the title with a lovely kiss!	shakespearean
Why, he was met even now As mad as the vexed sea, singing aloud, Crowned with rank fumiter and furrow-weeds, With burdocks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo-flowers, Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow In our sustaining corn.—A century send forth.	shakespearean
Here, take away the dish.	modern
Sometimes the love my subjects bring me is inconvenient, but I still accept it as love.	modern
It is not nor it cannot come to good, But break, my heart, for I must hold my tongue.	shakespearean
You expect me to cry?	modern
If people take what he says, fine.	modern
No, uncle, I won’t be married.	modern
Is he gone?	shakespearean
That’s true, it’s your beauty’s fault.	modern
What you know, you know.	shakespearean
O, he is mad, Laertes.	shakespearean
In prison we’ll outlast hordes of rulers that will come and go as their fortunes change.	modern
He is a proper man’s picture, but alas, who can converse with a dumb show?	shakespearean
Good monster!	modern
And I remember the kissing of her batler, and the cow’s dugs that her pretty chopped hands had milked.	shakespearean
My lord, the enemy has already passed the marsh.	modern
Here, sir!	shakespearean
Call in the messengers and we’ll find out.	modern
You have a daughter named Elizabeth, who is virtuous and beautiful, aristocratic and full of grace.	modern
For whose sake did I that ill deed?	shakespearean
She is welcome to stay.	modern
I don’t have the proud melancholy of a courtier or the ambitious melancholy of a soldier or the calculated melancholy of a lawyer.	modern
Where souls do couch on flowers, we’ll hand in hand, And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze.	shakespearean
Isn’t it a pain that I can’t choose or refuse anyone, Nerissa?	modern
Never, my lord.	shakespearean
I’m here, here!	modern
Bring me a bigger one.	modern
He calls to horse, but will I know not whither.	shakespearean
If your highness is willing, take revenge on him for that—because I know you’re brave enough, I don’t dare to— That’s for sure.	modern
Well that’s good.	modern
Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the operation of your sun.	shakespearean
Sir, I shall study deserving.	shakespearean
Well, then, you don’t have the affection that would teach you that you and I are one.	modern
What, we have many goodly days to see!	shakespearean
Thou 'lt be afraid to hear it.	shakespearean
As love is, my lord, before it loves.	shakespearean
Yes, my lord.	modern
Have them come in.	modern
Truly, I would the gods had made thee poetical.	shakespearean
She cannot deny it.	shakespearean
Whither away?	shakespearean
No more.	shakespearean
Oh, gods, give me patience!	modern
I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.	shakespearean
But if I had wit enough to get out of this wood, I have enough to serve mine own turn.	shakespearean
Do not, Phoebe.	shakespearean
But have I not cause to weep?	shakespearean
What’s new, cousin Lodovico?	modern
But aren’t there some healthy men whom we have to make sick?	modern
Repent that e’er thy tongue Hath so betrayed thine act.	shakespearean
An annoying schoolboy, unworthy of such an honor, joined by a masquerader and a partier!	modern
It’s a good thing I’m like a little pot and warm up quickly, or else my lips themselves would freeze and stick to my teeth, my tongue to the roof of my mouth, and my heart would freeze in my belly, before I managed to get thawed out.	modern
Of what city, may I ask?	modern
A hornèd man’s a monster and a beast.	shakespearean
Hence, horrible villain, or I’ll spurn thine eyes Like balls before me!	shakespearean
I will none.	shakespearean
No, you’re just reminding me of something I’ve also noticed.	modern
So you’re admitting Clarence, my father, is dead.	modern
I am to pray you not to strain my speech To grosser issues nor to larger reach Than to suspicion.	shakespearean
Maybe he’s not feeling well.	modern
I have a daughter—have while she is mine— Who in her duty and obedience, mark, Hath given me this.	shakespearean
He will be fooled into thinking he is greater than fate, he will mock death, and he will think he is above wisdom, grace, and fear.	modern
Seek to know no more.	shakespearean
The crowner hath sat on her and finds it Christian burial.	shakespearean
A most high miracle!	shakespearean
And I beseech you instantly to visit My too much changèd son.	shakespearean
If you love her then, tomorrow wed her.	shakespearean
Bathe his filthy head with warm, scented water.	modern
Antony will go where his passion is.	modern
The queen, my lord, is dead.	shakespearean
Short but still tedious?	modern
We are very sorry for’t.	shakespearean
Lock the door.	modern
If they speak but truth of her, These hands shall tear her; if they wrong her honor, The proudest of them shall well hear of it.	shakespearean
Yes, what time is it?	modern
If but as well I other accents borrow, That can my speech diffuse, my good intent May carry through itself to that full issue For which I razed my likeness.	shakespearean
I don’t like it that you knew about this, Iago.	modern
O, remember, God, To hear her prayer for them, as now for us!	shakespearean
Make no delay.	shakespearean
Tis time to part.	shakespearean
If you and I don’t value her equally, it would be better for us to work out our differences without her.	modern
An evil soul using a holy story is like a criminal who smiles at you.	modern
That’s very true, my lord.	shakespearean
My bones want to rest after helping me up to this hour.	modern
Sir, you and I must part company—no, that’s not it.	modern
But now, Baptista, to your younger daughter.	shakespearean
Honestly, no.	modern
Fly, masters!	shakespearean
Look at me crying—what a fool I am to cry at what makes me happy.	modern
I hope your love for me remains this strong for your entire life!	modern
Lean forward.	modern
Good old lord Gonzalo,” as you call him, is saddest of all, with tears running down his beard.	modern
What’s going on here, you secret, evil, midnight hags?	modern
With that I kiss your hand and call you my queen.	modern
I want my bond.	modern
Whip him, fellows, until he screws up his face like a baby and cries aloud for mercy!	modern
That’s not so good now.	shakespearean
I urge you to deliver your verdict.	modern
Who knows not that?	shakespearean
But what if my answer’s no?	modern
Now, by this hand, I swear, I scorn the term, Nor shall my Nell keep lodgers.	shakespearean
No words.	shakespearean
Yes, yes, and let’s sing in unison, like two gypsies riding on a single horse.	modern
I wonder that you will still be talking, Signor Benedick.	shakespearean
I am bound to thee forever.	shakespearean
We’ll hear him what he says.	shakespearean
I’ll help you through this business.	modern
Here’s Lucentio, right son to the right Vincentio, That have by marriage made thy daughter mine While counterfeit supposes bleared thine eyne.	shakespearean
Your Highness bade me ask for it today.	shakespearean
What’s your message?	modern
I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts.	shakespearean
Don’t tug on my clothes.	modern
What a farce!	modern
But well and free, If thou so yield him, there is gold, and here My bluest veins to kiss—a hand that kings Have lipped, and trembled kissing.	shakespearean
Come away, away.	shakespearean
My brother’s love, the devil, and my own anger made me do it.	modern
I have great comfort from this fellow.	shakespearean
Tears seven times salt, Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!	shakespearean
As of a man faithful and honorable.	shakespearean
Hark further.	shakespearean
I desperately needed God’s blessing, but the word “Amen” stuck in my throat.	modern

Norfolk, we must have knocks, ha, must we not?	shakespearean
Yes, your Highness.	modern

None, Brutus, none.	shakespearean
Just tell me.	modern
If we offend, it is with our good will.	shakespearean
You can’t judge me based on what I do tonight.	modern
I would, if I had a mirror.	modern
Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man As e'er my conversation coped withal.	shakespearean
I’ve promised them I would, and they’re expecting it.	modern
But I think—I want to tell you the truth, and now that I think about it, I think this is true—I came here with Hermia.	modern

No, my lord, your polite words are not to the point.	modern
Come, bustle, bustle.	shakespearean
Then let the rain come down.	modern
My lord, you nod.	shakespearean
So, there’s the signal to ride.	modern
I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a lodging and say he lies here, or he lies there, were to lie in mine own throat.	shakespearean
Yet you are withered.	shakespearean
Please don’t tell me any more.	modern
I rest much bounden to you.	shakespearean
Oh, ay, Curtis, ay, and therefore fire, fire.	shakespearean
This means we’re having some mischievous fun.	modern
Think, when we talk of horses, that you see them Printing their proud hoofs i' th' receiving earth, For ’tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings, Carry them here and there, jumping o'er times,	shakespearean
The tiring journey seems to have made you gloomy.	modern
Yes, boy.	modern
What didn’t you like?	modern
Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person: Tell them when that my mother went with child Of that insatiate Edward, noble York My princely father then had wars in France, And, by true computation of the time, Found that the issue was not his begot, Which well appearèd in his lineaments, Being nothing like the noble duke my father.	shakespearean
False face must hide what the false heart doth know.	shakespearean
My dearest coz, I pray you school yourself.	shakespearean
You do the same.	modern
Let them curtsy with their left legs, and not presume to touch a hair of my master’s horse-tail till they kiss their hands.	shakespearean
Richard, the duke of Gloucester, is very dangerous, and the queen’s sons and brothers are haughty and proud—it would be better for this ailing country if they were subjects, not rulers.	modern
Believe none of us.	shakespearean
If you still love her after that, then marry her tomorrow.	modern
Shall I include hell as well?	modern
It was love that performed these miracles.	modern
Tis vile, unless it may be quaintly ordered, And better in my mind not undertook.	shakespearean
Oh, lovely.	modern
Thy evil spirit, Brutus.	shakespearean
Eighty ducats!	modern
What do you mean by “carriages”?	modern
Do but look up.	shakespearean
I have it not about me.	shakespearean

What did I keep for myself?	modern
The adult snake lies in the ditch.	modern
You are welcome here, sister.	modern
My dear Caius, I’ll explain the task at hand to you as we walk toward the man we must do it to.	modern
Nor what I have done by water.	shakespearean
Yet am I noble as the adversary I come to cope withal.	shakespearean
When the barrel’s empty, we’ll drink water.	modern

I would’ve been happy if the whole army had had sex with her, the lowest-ranking grunts and all, as long as I didn’t know anything about it.	modern
Just listen to him.	modern
My lord, could I have a word with you?	modern
Leave me.	modern
Good morning, noble sir.	modern
God give him joy!	shakespearean
His roguish madness Allows itself to any thing.	shakespearean

Now follow, if thou darest, to try whose right, Of thine or mine, is most in Helena.	shakespearean
While then, God be with you!	shakespearean
Good master, take it not unkindly, pray, That I have been thus pleasant with you both.	shakespearean
By the pricking of my thumbs, Something wicked this way comes.	shakespearean
Since she belongs to me, I can do what I want with her—as the law says: I can either make her marry Demetrius—or have her killed.	modern
O, she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence, railed at herself that she should be so immodest to write to one that she knew would flout her.	shakespearean
Which is the villain?	shakespearean
Enough of your magic spells, you hateful, withered hag.	modern
I’ll take all who served Brutus into my service.	modern
Tell me, good grandmother, is our father dead?	modern
An the duke had not given him sixpence a day for playing Pyramus, I’ll be hanged.	shakespearean
And sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring forth more islands.	shakespearean
Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars, It is the cause.	shakespearean
I myself.	shakespearean
Did he express any dissatisfaction with you, either in his words or his face?	modern
Who shall bar me from them?	shakespearean
Your words, like your wounds, bring you honor.	modern
When the mind’s free, The body’s delicate.	shakespearean
Then make a circle around Caesar’s corpse, and let me show you the man who made this will.	modern
He begins at curfew and walks till the first cock.	shakespearean
And when I rear my hand, do you the like, To fall it on Gonzalo.	shakespearean
Who can come in and say that I mean her, When such a one as she such is her neighbor?	shakespearean
She, dying, gave it me And bid me, when my fate would have me wived, To give it her.	shakespearean
No, let’s not swear an oath.	modern
Follow your spirit, and as you charge cry, “God for Harry, England, and Saint George!”	modern
I am not Cinna the conspirator.	shakespearean
Be patient with him, Brutus.	modern
The Fairyland buys not the child of me.	shakespearean
O, name him not.	shakespearean
Shut the doors after you.	modern
He’s in his chambers now, and he’s extremely upset.	modern
You will compel me, then, to read the will?	shakespearean
Fair enough.	modern
One of them showed me a ring that he had of your daughter for a monkey.	shakespearean
For I am almost ready to dissolve, Hearing of this.	shakespearean
But I beseech your Grace pardon me.	shakespearean
Who shall stay you?	shakespearean
I sincerely hope it does you good, mangy rascal.	modern
How do you mean, removing of him?	shakespearean
Oh, let me speak!	modern
That I have labored With all my wits, my pains, and strong endeavors, To bring your most imperial Majesties Unto this bar and royal interview, Your mightiness on both parts best can witness.	shakespearean
Noses, ears, and lips.	shakespearean
How can you top that?	modern
Ay, sweet Rosalind.	shakespearean
Indeed, sir, it is.	modern
She hangs around me all the time.	modern
Go to, you are too shrewd.	shakespearean
The morn is fair.	shakespearean
What malice was between you?	shakespearean
I’ll find him right away, sir, and carry out the business as well as I can.	modern
Of a strange nature is the suit you follow, Yet in such rule that the Venetian law Cannot impugn you as you do proceed.—   Ay, so he says.	shakespearean
Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.	shakespearean
If it weren’t for the fact that so many of our soldiers revolted and joined them, we could have met them out in front of the castle, man to man, and beaten them back to England.	modern
May I be bold To think these spirits?	shakespearean
Why, his cuckold’s horns, of course—the kind you men are always blaming on your wives.	modern
What do you have to say to me?	modern
The oats have eaten the horses.	shakespearean
Tender yourself more dearly, Or—not to crack the wind of the poor phrase, Running it thus—you’ll tender me a fool.	shakespearean
Just notice.	modern
You, my earthly moon, are now eclipsed, and that alone foretells my ruin.	modern
I can get the better of religion and a few flimsy vows between a misguided barbarian and a depraved Venetian girl.	modern
That with this little arm and this good sword I have made my way through more impediments Than twenty times your stop.	shakespearean
You swore to me when I gave it to you that you would wear it till you died, and that it would be buried with you.	modern
O thou good Kent, how shall I live and work To match thy goodness?	shakespearean
still fight you and embed your lies back in your hellish heart.—Trumpets, blow!	modern
Death is the best way to cover over her shame.	modern
To be brief—as the occasion requires—prepare to fight early in the morning, when your future will be decided.	modern
Truly, the more to blame he.	shakespearean
In that case, I think Cassio’s an honest man.	modern
Thou art too wild, too rude and bold of voice— Parts that become thee happily enough And in such eyes as ours appear not faults.	shakespearean
Bid her come hither.	shakespearean
Thank you, madam.	modern
They can’t have changed; there’s no way this could be true.	modern
Farewell to both of you, dear teachers.	modern
The reason is that it’s what I want.	modern
Well, it doesn’t matter anymore.	modern
Cheer up as much as you can.	modern
Fulvia thy wife is dead.	shakespearean
I’ll go for a short walk to calm down my feverish mind.	modern
No, you were one of Gneius Pompey’s leftovers—not to mention your other, more depraved affairs, which have somehow managed to avoid becoming the subject of vulgar gossip.	modern
It’s so simple!	modern
You’ve won the wager, and I will add twenty thousand crowns to what they owe you.	modern
I take it your own business calls on you And you embrace th' occasion to depart.	shakespearean
Didn’t you hear their shouts?	modern
Why are you calling him a jerk?	modern
By my faith, you have great reason to be sad.	shakespearean
What, are you afraid?	modern
Good old knight, gather them all together at my tent.	modern
The king mine uncle is to blame for it.	shakespearean
Not me.	modern
Or rather, do I not in plainest truth Tell you I do not, nor I cannot, love you?	shakespearean
Neither can my accomplishments at sea.	modern
Ah, for our father, for our dear lord Clarence!	shakespearean
What does the silver one say?	modern
The glowworm’s light is beginning to fade, so morning is near.	modern
Yes, but that makes me love you even more.	modern
We’re not getting any younger.	modern
That’s me.	modern
What makes you say that?	modern
Peace to you, my lord of Burgundy.	modern
I’ll tell thee more of this another time.	shakespearean
Who, I, my lord?	shakespearean
I was told that by one who knows him better than you.	modern
Let it go all.	shakespearean
At mine unworthiness, that dare not offer What I desire to give, and much less take What I shall die to want.	shakespearean
But since this has happened, you should fix it for your own good.	modern
He is a very proper man.	shakespearean
As good a gentleman as the emperor.	shakespearean
Confess and love” Had been the very sum of my confession.	shakespearean
I assure your majesty I’m only doing my duty both to my God and my good king.	modern
O ill-starred wench, Pale as thy smock!	shakespearean
My God, that’s my handkerchief!	modern
We’re still just beginners when it comes to crime.	modern
Look, love, see how devoted I am?	modern
Yes, exactly.	modern
Give me thy hand.	shakespearean
I could have blown up the town in an hour.	modern

You were kneeled to and importuned otherwise By all of us, and the fair soul herself Weighed between loathness and obedience, at Which end o' th' beam should bow.	shakespearean
I don’t understand—how should I answer that?	modern
I’ll remember.	modern
The king isn’t the one sending you to the Tower, Clarence.	modern
Hurry.—Oh, love, if you could only watch the battle today and see how expert I am at my craft.	modern
Let the world collapse around us.	modern
To race after your departing ships, leaving his navy to watch, was a shame as great as the resulting loss.	modern
But I didn’t want to be free like this.	modern
Young budding virgin, fair and fresh and sweet, Whither away, or where is thy abode?	shakespearean

If wolves had been howling outside your gate at the heart of that storm, you would’ve told your doorman to let them in, despite all the cruelties you inflict on the world.	modern
No, it begins again.	shakespearean
These cowards manage to make fools of brave men.	modern
I laugh at any weapon used by a man who was born from a woman.	modern
I didn’t think you would follow me.	modern
The last she spake Was “Antony, most noble Antony!” Then in the midst a tearing groan did break The name of Antony.	shakespearean
You promised to take a full year off my sentence.	modern
Tis dangerous to be spoken.	shakespearean
What, did Caesar swoon?	shakespearean
If I do die before thee, prithee, shroud me In one of these same sheets.	shakespearean
Meet presently at the palace.	shakespearean
Doesn’t a Jew eat the same food, get hurt with the same weapons, get sick with the same diseases, get healed by the same medicine, and warm up in summer and cool off in winter just like a Christian?	modern
I thumb my nose at superstitions.	modern
I will proclaim my name around the field.	modern
But what danger we’ll put ourselves in, two young, innocent women traveling so far!	modern

Only if the hearer is a fool or a coward.	modern
Yet hear me speak.	shakespearean
Civil wounds now can heal, and peace can live again.	modern
Indeed, he plied them both with excellent praises.	shakespearean
That’s the whore’s curse, to seduce many men, but to be seduced by one.	modern
Don’t stick your head out into the public street to stare at the Christian fools with painted faces.	modern
Would raise babies and clip coupons.	modern
Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world Like a Colossus, and we petty men Walk under his huge legs and peep about To find ourselves dishonorable graves.	shakespearean
How canst thou urge God’s dreadful law to us When thou hast broke it in such dear degree?	shakespearean
By Janus, I think no.	shakespearean
I think I hear Antony call me.	modern
A very gentle beast, of a good conscience.	shakespearean
I will.	modern
What did that gentile fool say to you, hmmm?	modern
Ay, and for that thou diest.	shakespearean
We’re wasting time here.	modern
I’ll be back soon, and if I haven’t brought you anything to eat, I will give you permission to die.	modern
Then to the wood will he tomorrow night Pursue her.	shakespearean
For what advancement may I hope from thee That no revenue hast but thy good spirits, To feed and clothe thee?	shakespearean
Thy case, dear friend, Shall be my precedent.	shakespearean
As wicked dew as e'er my mother brushed With raven’s feather from unwholesome fen Drop on you both!	shakespearean
I should sit in the corner and sing that song, “Heigh-Ho for a Husband!” Lady Beatrice, I’ll get you a husband.	modern
Fine apparition!	shakespearean
A woman who doesn’t know how to make her own indiscretions look like her husband’s fault is hardly a woman.	modern
Be not you ashamed to show, he’ll not shame to tell you what it means.	shakespearean
That’s true, my lord.	modern
Her only fault, and that is faults enough, Is that she is intolerable curst, And shrewd and froward, so beyond all measure That, were my state far worser than it is, I would not wed her for a mine of gold.	shakespearean
A messenger from the galleys.	shakespearean
I know thee, Roderigo.	shakespearean
Indeed, it’s a strange time.	modern
My services are at your command.	modern
They were nearly killing each other, as you saw when you pulled them apart.	modern
I say unto thee, I bid thy master cutout the gown, but I did not bid him cut it to pieces.	shakespearean
I don’t see any Thisbe.	modern
Locked in her tomb.	modern
I’m coming, my lord.	modern
For it is a figure in rhetoric that drink, being poured out of a cup into a glass, by filling the one doth empty the other.	shakespearean
We’ll take you there.	modern
Fair and noble hostess, We are your guest tonight.	shakespearean
The moon methinks looks with a watery eye.	shakespearean
Your friend,      Artemidorus.” I’ll stand here until Caesar passes by, and I’ll give him this as though it’s a petition.	modern
I’m not well.	modern
Well, good-bye, Portia.	modern
Oh, noble sir!	modern
He died As one that had been studied in his death To throw away the dearest thing he owed As ’twere a careless trifle.	shakespearean
Cheer yourself.	modern
They’re such oversexed gluttons that I feel like we’re living in a pub or a whorehouse rather than a respectable palace.	modern
If thou wert my fool, nuncle, I’d have thee beaten for being old before thy time.	shakespearean
He cannot be such a monster— Nor is not, sure.	shakespearean
We are blest that Rome is rid of him.	shakespearean
Pass on the command to halt!	modern
To die for adultery?	modern
See for the news.	shakespearean
I have seen you gleeking and galling at this gentleman twice or thrice.	shakespearean
The bearer of bad news is often blamed for it.	modern
You think so?	modern
What, for a counter, would I do but good?	shakespearean
I was the man i' the moon when time was.	shakespearean
Either we go after Pompey or he’ll come after us.	modern
Yes, that’s my husband’s name.	modern
O Cicero, I have seen tempests when the scolding winds Have rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen Th' ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam To be exalted with the threatening clouds, But never till tonight, never till now, Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.	shakespearean
Come, my lord, and in our flight Tell me how it came this night That I sleeping here was found With these mortals on the ground.	shakespearean
Beware of jealousy, my lord!	modern
And for I know she taketh most delight In music, instruments, and poetry, Schoolmasters will I keep within my house, Fit to instruct her youth.	shakespearean
How could he have even entertained these thoughts in his heart?	modern
I beg you, turn away and cry for her.	modern
On a night like this, young Lorenzo swore he loved her very much, stealing her heart with vows of love, but not one vow was true.	modern
It’s true I heard a humming sound, a strange one, which woke me up.	modern
Thou torturest me, Tubal.	shakespearean
O the blessed gods!	shakespearean
Since Macbeth went to war, I have seen her rise from her bed, put on her nightgown, unlock her closet, take out some paper, fold it, write on it, read it, seal it up, and then return to bed, remaining asleep the entire time.	modern
Thou shalt Go back, I warrant thee!	shakespearean
What noise is that?	shakespearean
The death of Antony Is not a single doom.	shakespearean
We’ll burn Brutus’s house.	modern
For us, you know Whose he is we are, and that is Caesar’s.	shakespearean
O, fear me not.	shakespearean
It is his hand, my lord, but I hope his heart is not in the contents.	shakespearean
Caesar’s sister is named Octavia.	modern
O, everlasting shame!	modern
Thou runaway, thou coward, art thou fled?	shakespearean
I don’t want to hear you sing.	modern
Good my lord, enter here.	shakespearean
O my lord, my lord, Forgive my fearful sails!	shakespearean
Yes, you’re absolutely right about how worthy Brutus is and how much we need him.	modern
Then see the evidence of their evil with your own eyes.	modern
My dear clever Ariel, listen carefully.	modern
Did ever Dian so become a grove As Kate this chamber with her princely gait?	shakespearean
You’re shaking with emotion.	modern
If he has my father’s love, then that’s enough honor for me.	modern
Are you sure we’re awake?	modern
Come over here, gentlemen, and put your hands on my sword again.	modern
It is not for your health thus to commit Your weak condition to the raw, cold morning.	shakespearean
And when I have stol'n upon these sons-in-law, Then, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!	shakespearean
Now, by my holidam, here comes Katherina!	shakespearean
Give him the goblet.	modern
There’s no crab-apple here, so don’t look sour.	modern
We’ll be married tomorrow.	modern
How are you, Hero?	modern
Well, we almost fought and then realized that we had reached the seventh cause.	modern
I won’t say a word.	modern
Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol?	shakespearean
So you shall.	shakespearean
Look where he comes.	shakespearean
Long live the king!	shakespearean
I lay with Cassio lately And, being troubled with a raging tooth, I could not sleep.	shakespearean
He’d begged me to steal it many times.	modern
I say you are not.	shakespearean
And last night at dinner, you got up abruptly and paced back and forth with your arms crossed, brooding and sighing, and when I asked you what was the matter, you gave me a dirty look.	modern
Pray, have you not a daughter Called Katherina, fair and virtuous?	shakespearean
Feel you your legs?	shakespearean
Now be quiet.	modern
Where are your leather apron and your ruler?	modern
The foul fiend follows me!	shakespearean
Sir, is it possible that a person could fall in love so suddenly?	modern
Yes, faith.	shakespearean
Dorset, embrace him.—Hastings, love Lord Marquess.	shakespearean
And be a happy mother by doing so.	modern
She provoked me with her lying mouth, accusing me of crimes I didn’t commit.	modern
How but well, sir?	shakespearean
Say you have wronged her, sir.	shakespearean
It may be so, my lord.	shakespearean
And I pray thee now tell me, for which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me?	shakespearean
I never did her any, to my knowledge.	shakespearean
Every one.	shakespearean
There is ten thousand— Geese, villain?	shakespearean
We are haunted.	shakespearean
I will follow.	shakespearean
I like her more than I can say.	modern
Yes, if that would be all right with your Lordship.	modern
Here was he merry, hearing of a song.	shakespearean
How shall we beguile The lazy time if not with some delight?	shakespearean
Now gods that we adore, whereof comes this?	shakespearean
All right.	modern
Cruel, cruel news!	modern
I’m not a traitor, unfair lady.	modern
Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes, I will be brief: your noble son is mad.	shakespearean
I have neither cleverness nor rhetorical skill nor the authority nor gesture nor eloquence nor the power of speech to stir men up.	modern
And that’s all there is to it.	modern
I do embrace your offer; and dispose For henceforth of poor Claudio.	shakespearean
Enjoy thy plainness.	shakespearean
The gods confound thee!	shakespearean
I’m wide awake.	modern
Otherwise I would have been perfect, as solid as a piece of marble, as firm as a rock, as free as the air itself.	modern
What’s up, Catesby, what does your master say?	modern
Damn you!	modern
Come on, Nerissa, I want to go see this man who’s come so courteously.	modern
Thou shouldst be honest.	shakespearean
I’m good at everything that ordinary men can do.	modern
I pray thee, hear me speak.	shakespearean
I beseech you, sir, pardon me.	shakespearean
I found it in my chamber, And he himself confessed but even now That there he dropped it for a special purpose Which wrought to his desire.	shakespearean
What sense had I in her stol'n hours of lust?	shakespearean
If you can’t do it, be grateful you’ve lived this long and go wait to die in your cabin, if it comes to that.—Harder, men!—Now get out of our way, I’m telling you.	modern
Sleep shall neither night nor day Hang upon his penthouse lid.	shakespearean
His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.	shakespearean
What’s the matter?	modern
But shhh!	modern
Whether you bite to kill, Mastiff, greyhound, or ugly mutt,	modern
Ever since Venus and her blind son plotted a way for the god of the underworld to steal my daughter away for half the year, I swore I’d never speak to them again.	modern
Graces will appear, and there’s an end.	shakespearean
And I have met a gentleman Hath promised me to help me to another, A fine musician to instruct our mistress.	shakespearean
Catch me if you can!	modern
The only reason you left India was to come here and see that butch Amazon Hippolyta.	modern
Will you not tell me who told you so?	shakespearean
So, perhaps, did yours.	modern
Is it a custom?	shakespearean
With his own lightning bolts; I’ve shaken up the sturdy cliffs and uprooted pines and cedars; I’ve opened up graves and awakened the corpses sleeping in them, letting them out with my powerful magic.	modern
I second that	modern
Nature in you stands on the very verge Of his confine.	shakespearean
Macbeth has come.	modern
Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance, Nor bite the lip as angry wenches will, Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk.	shakespearean
Go ahead—say “Amen.” No more talking.	modern
So don’t spend one night away from this house.	modern
Why, here is the note of the fashion to testify.	shakespearean
O dear father, It is thy business that I go about.	shakespearean
But no matter—I’ll get back at him soon enough.	modern
How now?	shakespearean
What will you do?	shakespearean
Have his daughters made him crazy like this?—Couldn’t you have kept something for yourself?	modern
Caesar is turned to hear.	shakespearean
Hold, my hand.	shakespearean
I was wrong to her— Do you know how an oyster makes its shell?	modern
If I do prove her haggard, Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings, I’d whistle her off and let her down the wind To prey at fortune.	shakespearean
I’m really a pitiful singer.	modern
Now tell me how long you intend to keep her.	modern
Stop that alarm from ringing, it’s scaring the islanders.	modern
Welcome, sir.	modern
Is ’t like that lead contains her?	shakespearean
My brains are injured.	modern
Yes, madam.	modern
I’ve made my choice.	modern
Is that enough of an answer?	modern
Not so.	shakespearean
You know that you are Brutus that speak this, Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.	shakespearean
Take your seat.	modern
That’s what I’m doing.	modern
Let’s go, Tom.	modern
What is your name?	modern
I’ll humor him when he learns how to behave.	modern
Don’t delay, Caesar.	modern
You know, you’re right.	modern
There’s money for your pains.	shakespearean
Wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king of this country.	shakespearean
Adieu, good Monsieur Melancholy.	shakespearean
You devil, you’ve put a spell on her!	modern
Don’t go near Casca.	modern
When we are born, we cry that we are come To this great stage of fools.	shakespearean
No, my good lord.	shakespearean
But on thy side I may not be too forward, Lest, being seen, thy brother, tender George, Be executed in his father’s sight.	shakespearean
If not, the Fates with traitors do contrive.	shakespearean
Master, go on, and I will follow thee To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty.	shakespearean
Those linen cheeks of thine Are counselors to fear.	shakespearean
I was born to speak cleverly, not seriously.	modern
Ay, madam.	shakespearean
If you interrupt this monster with one more word, I’ll beat you like a piece of salted fish.	modern
I here do give thee that with all my heart Which, but thou hast already, with all my heart I would keep from thee.	shakespearean
Oh, my mistress, a villain has made a mockery of your love!	modern
What am I, a cane?	modern
Oh, this is wonderful, wonderful—just wonderful wonderful!	modern
Farewell, farewell.	modern
One heart, one bed, two bosoms, and one troth.	shakespearean
Why, she would hang on him As if increase of appetite had grown By what it fed on, and yet, within a month— Let me not think on ’t.	shakespearean
Did you see Master Lorenzo?	shakespearean
My lord, I’ll tell you that self bill is urged Which in th' eleventh year of the last king’s reign Was like, and had indeed against us passed But that the scambling and unquiet time Did push it out of farther question.	shakespearean
I asked you for gold to pay my soldiers, and you wouldn’t give it to me.	modern
All those memories pain his mind so deeply that guilt and shame keep him away from Cordelia.	modern
Meanwhile, I’d be gratified if you’d live and eat your food.	modern
O God of battles, steel my soldiers' hearts.	shakespearean
Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.	shakespearean
Along the way, I’ll find an opportunity to separate him from the queen’s proud relatives, as step one in the plan we’ve discussed.	modern
There’s money for thee.	shakespearean
If you hang around me for two more years, you’ll forget the sound of your own voice.	modern
I am willing to fight you if I must.	modern
But other of your insolent retinue Do hourly carp and quarrel, breaking forth In rank and not-to-be-endurèd riots.	shakespearean
Please, Signior Gremio.	modern
When you have spoken your speech, enter into that brake.—And so everyone according to his cue.	shakespearean
That young man who was just here.	modern
Heaven preserve you!	shakespearean
What is thy news then?	shakespearean
And be assured you’ll find a difference, As we his subjects have in wonder found, Between the promise of his greener days And these he masters now.	shakespearean
Are you planning on showing me all your wit at once?	modern
It’s my daughter!	modern
Ay, madam.	shakespearean
Why, or for what, the nobles were committed Is all unknown to me, my gracious lord.	shakespearean
I’ll tell you what to do.	modern
God will take revenge.	modern
I will physic your rankness and yet give no thousand crowns neither.—Holla, Dennis!	shakespearean
Let’s withdraw, my lord.	shakespearean
Nay, if you strive— But half an hour!	shakespearean
Look—his noble blood is still on it.	modern
This is a guy who’s been praised for his honest bluntness, and who now insolently pretends to be plainspoken and twists the natural meanings of words.	modern
Yes, Petruchio.	modern
Nay, let me praise you while I have a stomach.	shakespearean
He’s standing ready outside the door.	modern
Welcome to Cyprus.	modern
Caesar has sent— Too slow a messenger.	modern
It was just an accident!	modern
May heaven save us from indecent thoughts!	modern
You horrid slave, you can’t be trained to be good, and you’re capable of anything evil!	modern
My eyesight has always been bad.	modern
My affections Are then most humble.	shakespearean
Just watch!	modern
I’ll bet we’re both thinking the same thing, master.	modern
She’s insistent.	modern
Are you drunk?	modern
Room, ho!	shakespearean
If you behave yourself and join us in our circle dance and moonlight celebrations, then you can come with us.	modern
I but believe it partly, For I am fresh of spirit and resolved To meet all perils very constantly.	shakespearean
If you swear, my lord, you shall not be forsworn.	shakespearean
She only appears honorable from the outside.	modern
Then shall we be news-crammed.	shakespearean
Your accent is something finer than you could purchase in so removed a dwelling.	shakespearean
I will challenge him.	shakespearean
Be angry whenever you like, it’s all right with me.	modern
This a good block.	shakespearean
It’s the same with men.	modern
Forever and forever farewell, Brutus.	shakespearean
If he could right himself with quarreling, Some of us would lie low.	shakespearean
Madam, oh, good Empress!	modern
No, please, speak seriously.	modern
There is the playhouse now, there must you sit, And thence to France shall we convey you safe And bring you back, charming the narrow seas To give you gentle pass; for, if we may, We’ll not offend one stomach with our play.	shakespearean
But now mine eyes, Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not.	shakespearean
This night methinks is but the daylight sick.	shakespearean
Hero is his only child, and his only heir.	modern
Didn’t you just say he was?	modern
We’ve been betrayed!	modern
The time will bring it out.	shakespearean
At our synagogue, Tubal.	shakespearean
Look, you’ve got his wrinkled hands.	modern
If ’twere not she, I cannot tell who told me.	shakespearean
We’ll beat ’em into bench-holes.	shakespearean
Tis certain there’s not a boy left alive, and the cowardly rascals that ran from the battle ha' done this slaughter.	shakespearean
It hath the primal eldest curse upon ’t, A brother’s murder.	shakespearean
When a wise man gives thee better counsel, give me mine again.	shakespearean
What says your Highness to my just request?	shakespearean
With him is Gratiano gone along.	shakespearean
I fear me you’ll be in till then.	shakespearean
Really, I had no intention of going for my sword.	modern
Do you not remember, lady, in your father’s time a Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came hither in company of the Marquess of Montferrat?	shakespearean
O, let me make the period to my curse!	shakespearean
Of it own color too.	shakespearean
I’ll pull on these smaller legs.	modern
What’s your profession?	modern
No, unpin me here.	shakespearean
For you to do it would be good service.	modern
Happy is your Grace, That can translate the stubbornness of fortune Into so quiet and so sweet a style.	shakespearean
Give me leave To speak my mind, and I will through and through Cleanse the foul body of th' infected world, If they will patiently receive my medicine.	shakespearean
Who’s there, in th' other devil’s name?	shakespearean
Call the messengers!	modern
With news the time’s with labor, and throws forth Each minute some.	shakespearean
Nobody come?	shakespearean
If she’d been faithful to me, I never would have given her up, not even if God himself offered me a jewel as big as a planet in exchange for her.	modern
Oh, finish what I’ve begun.	modern
He’s given his empire to a whore, and now they’re gathering kings to wage a war.	modern
There was a noise, that’s certainly true.	modern
For my part, the sea cannot drown me.	shakespearean
Anyway, he is what he is.	modern
If I live to see it, I will never trust his word after.	shakespearean
The noise they’re making will wake up Demetrius.	modern
We therefore have great cause of thankfulness And shall forget the office of our hand Sooner than quittance of desert and merit According to the weight and worthiness.	shakespearean
Now that’s done, I’m going to walk on the fortification walls.	modern
Would Katherine had never seen him, though!	shakespearean
Lead the way, sir.	modern
But there is, sir, an eyrie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapped for ’t.	shakespearean
Meantime God grants that we have need of you.	shakespearean
Thy mother was a piece of virtue and She said thou wast my daughter.	shakespearean
Anon, as patient as the female dove When that her golden couplets are disclosed, His silence will sit drooping.	shakespearean
And let him ply his music.	shakespearean
Highest queen of state, Great Juno, comes.	shakespearean
All for our vantage.	shakespearean
What are you going to do?	modern
Not much.	modern
That you should think we come not to offend, But with good will.	shakespearean
We don’t think so, my lord.	modern
He does well to commend it himself.	shakespearean
Love is merely a madness and, I tell you, deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do, and the reason why they are not so punished and cured is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love, too.	shakespearean
And yet for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that starve with nothing.	shakespearean
God bless you.	modern
He forbids it, Being free from vainness and self-glorious pride, Giving full trophy, signal, and ostent Quite from himself, to God.	shakespearean
If not, he’s got truth on his side!	modern
Come, driver!	modern
I’ve seen her claim to be dying twenty times before, and for far less reason.	modern
But how?	modern
We’ll outwit them all—that old geezer, Gremio; the suspicious father, Minola; the prim musician lover, Litio—all for the sake of my master, Lucentio.	modern
I was about to protest I loved you.	shakespearean
Home, you idle creatures get you home!	shakespearean
When thou wakest, if she be by, Beg of her for remedy.	shakespearean
Go carry them and smear The sleepy grooms with blood.	shakespearean
You can command a beggar to bow on bended knee, but can you take possession of his health?	modern
Young boys and girls are equal to men.	modern
Oh, Tranio, what a cruel father he is.	modern
In suicide, gods make the weak strong.	modern
Only when they’re dead can I start to count my gains.	modern
Trinculo, speak politely.	modern
They’re all ready to eat dinner.	modern
Octavia has a pious, chaste, meek disposition.	modern
With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my Rosalind.	shakespearean
O, ’tis a parlous boy, Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable.	shakespearean
He’ll grow up to be a proper man.	modern
Her love to both Would each to other and all loves to both Draw after her.	shakespearean
Go by, Saint Jeronimy.	shakespearean
Are those my tents on fire?	modern
Go ahead if you want, but remember that crying doesn’t suit a man.	modern
And if thy poor devoted servant may But beg one favor at thy gracious hand, Thou dost confirm his happiness forever.	shakespearean
There is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young plants with carving “Rosalind” on their barks, hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies on brambles, all, forsooth, deifying the name of Rosalind.	shakespearean
I came to Venice with a number of Antonio’s creditors who say he won’t be able to avoid going bankrupt.	modern
Foul, wrinkled witch, what mak’st thou in my sight?	shakespearean
Your sister’s the better soldier of the two.	modern
Give me my robe, because I’m going.	modern
It was my duty, sir.	shakespearean
Is ’t possible?	shakespearean
Iago, who started it?	modern
I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.	shakespearean
Antonio shall become bound, well.	shakespearean
Take from them now The sense of reck'ning ere th' opposèd numbers Pluck their hearts from them.	shakespearean
Say something again.	modern
Come, mistress Kate, I’ll bear you company.	shakespearean
You mean, to bear me, not to bear        My protector, Richard, insists on it.	modern
One unperfectness shows me another, to make me frankly despise myself.	shakespearean
But I’m running ahead of myself.	modern
What are you saying?	modern
By this hand, Claudio shall render me a dear account.	shakespearean
There’s little of the melancholy element in her, my lord.	shakespearean
Caesar, you’re not going to be killed by a traitor—unless you kill yourself..	modern
Sister, where thou?	shakespearean
It’s true!	modern
You will never fall victim to Benedick’s charms, my niece.	modern
Oh, for Pete’s sake!	modern
When will we get to the top of that cliff?	modern
What an excellent idea—he’ll soak up the wine!	modern
I have heard more since.	shakespearean
But I have cause to pry into this pedant.	shakespearean
If you were king, we would do the same.	modern
Please do.	modern
Only th’ adulterous Antony, most large In his abominations, turns you off And gives his potent regiment to a trull That noises it against us.	shakespearean
Signor Brabantio, hey!	modern
I told you, sir, they were totally drunk, so puffed up with courage that they were getting angry at the air for blowing in their faces, and beating the ground for touching their feet—yet even when drunk, they kept their plan firmly in mind.	modern
Tell your wife to watch her.	modern
But it is his handwriting?	modern
No, gentle madam.	modern
I can’t speak to her, even though she asked me to.	modern
The greater cantle of the world is lost With very ignorance.	shakespearean
Then be so kind as to show them in.	modern
I have been worth the whistle.	shakespearean
All right, now I’m starting to lose my cool.	modern
Ungodly and monstrous!	modern
Gracious Lord, blunt the swords of those traitors who mean to tear poor England apart again!	modern
Will he bring his power?	shakespearean
If he love Caesar, all that he can do Is to himself: take thought and die for Caesar.	shakespearean
Sweet now, silence.	shakespearean
Great God of heaven, say amen to all!	shakespearean
This by Calphurnia’s dream is signified.	shakespearean
But quiet, be quiet a minute.	modern
Have the excavators stopped work?	modern
This is a man’s invention, and his hand.	shakespearean
Run, run, O, run!	shakespearean
Aren’t the playwrights hurting them by making them upstage adult actors, which they are going to grow up and become?	modern
Oh, how stupid!	modern
Out, out, brief candle!	shakespearean
I’ll say you’re not feeling well.	modern
So go ahead and have your terrifying fun.	modern
Musicians, come in!	modern
Sir, I tell you we believe you’re both lying criminals.	modern
Good spirit!	modern
Who pronounced this death sentence before a court of law could even convict me?	modern
Your doctors have expressly forbidden me to sleep with you, as there’s a risk that you might have a relapse.	modern
Then run away.	modern
He’s nearby, and Pindarus has come to salute you on behalf of his master.	modern
And thence from Athens turn away our eyes To seek new friends and stranger companies.	shakespearean
And you can’t put your heads together and figure out why he’s acting so dazed and confused, ruining his peace and quiet with such dangerous displays of lunacy?	modern
Keep thy word.	shakespearean
Prithee, put up.	shakespearean
Can I have a word with you?	modern
The king has heard them, but as yet has made no answer.	modern
Do you think you’ve won?	modern
Come like shadows; so depart!	shakespearean
We are, my lord, and come to have the warrant That we may be admitted where he is.	shakespearean
Please tell me what you’re thinking—even your worst suspicions.	modern
It’s true I’m not married, Caesar.	modern
There’s other business for thee.	shakespearean
Verona, for a while I take my leave, To see my friends in Padua, but of all My best belovèd and approvèd friend, Hortensio.	shakespearean
You, niece.	modern
I’d be as right for the job as you are, and I’d do it more easily, since I’d have good will on my side.	modern
Let me go, gentlemen.	modern
But who comes here?	shakespearean
Why, how now, monsieur?	shakespearean
I tell you true.	shakespearean
We would not want to die in the company of a man who fears to die with us.	modern
But if you didn’t know about it, then you were wrong to get mad at us.	modern
What thou seest when thou dost wake, Do it for thy true love take.	shakespearean
There was more foolery yet, if I could remember it.	shakespearean
That counts for everything.	modern
Hold off your hands.	shakespearean
Nay, that’s certain.	shakespearean
You have to be patient, madam.	modern
I’ll leave you.	shakespearean
If it does pass, the Church will lose more than half of what it possesses, because the bill would strip us of enough real estate left to the church by wealthy, pious men in their wills to support fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights, six thousand two hundred squires, and a hundred well-supplied almshouses for the relief of lepers, old-age pensioners, the poor, and those too weak or sick to work.	modern
Show them in.	modern
Pardon the frankness of my mirth if I answer you for that.	shakespearean
Nay, good lieutenant!	shakespearean
I know him not.	shakespearean
Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know Wherefore they do it.	shakespearean
Think on Lord Hastings.	shakespearean
Having already thought about the fact that she would have to die sometime, I can endure her death now.	modern
Then if he loses, it’ll be his swan song, music before the end.	modern
If you aren’t immortal, watch those around you.	modern
Within our files there are, Of those that served Mark Antony but late, Enough to fetch him in.	shakespearean
Do you know the way to Dover?	modern
When Caesar says “do this,” it is done.	modern
He said “Goodbye, madam,” and nothing else.	modern
What is the success?	shakespearean
You are welcome.	shakespearean
Filth, thou liest!	shakespearean
Who’s that?	modern
And fixed his eyes upon you?	shakespearean
If we, with thrice such powers left at home, Cannot defend our own doors from the dog, Let us be worried, and our nation lose The name of hardiness and policy.	shakespearean
Buzz, buzz.	shakespearean
Now two things still need to be done.	modern
Look after my goods and possessions.	modern
Our fortune lies Upon this jump.	shakespearean
A dear happiness to women.	shakespearean
How can a tailor make a person?	modern
I am not of many words, but I thank you.	shakespearean
Who’s closest to him?	modern
Well then, your uncle and the Prince and Claudio have been deceived.	modern
What do you say, Signior Gremio?	modern
To the health of our general!	shakespearean
Caius Ligarius, I was never your enemy so much as the sickness that’s made you so thin.	modern
Antony Did tell me of you, bade me trust you, but I do not greatly care to be deceived, That have no use for trusting.	shakespearean
My mind and courage will never falter with doubt or shake with fear.	modern
Your overkindness doth wring tears from me.	shakespearean
Oh God, what a heinous sinner I am, being ashamed to be my father’s child!	modern
O sir, such a life with such a wife were strange!	shakespearean
Farewell, old man.	modern
Is Scotland the same as when I left it?	modern
So get ready to leave.	modern
The letters he spoke of may help me.	modern
I’ve been alive for twenty-eight years, and I’ve never met a man who knew what was good for him.	modern
That will kill our lovers.	modern
Nay, by 'r Lady, that I think he cannot.	shakespearean
A very mean meaning.	shakespearean
Plucking the entrails of an offering forth, They could not find a heart within the beast.	shakespearean
Let their beds be as soft as yours, and let them eat the same food as you”?	modern
He who chooses me must give and risk all he has.” You’d have to be more attractive for me to give or risk anything for you.	modern
Wait a minute, Jew.	modern
Her husband, knave.	shakespearean
Which, when I saw rehearsed, I must confess, Made mine eyes water—but more merry tears The passion of loud laughter never shed.	shakespearean
Please tell your brother what a convincing show I put on.	modern
I want you.	modern
No, if without more words you will get you hence.	shakespearean
You must leave this.	shakespearean
A thing of no importance.	modern
As far as I’m concerned, what’s past is done.	modern
Come, last of my friends, rest on this rock.	modern
I hear the minstrels play.	shakespearean
What do you say to a piece of beef with mustard?	modern
Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.	shakespearean
Is your master awake?	modern
We have not made good preparation.	shakespearean
Old lord, I cannot blame thee, Who am myself attached with weariness To th' dulling of my spirits.	shakespearean
I’m forty-eight.	modern
I pray you all, stand up.	shakespearean
Cassius, what night is this!	shakespearean
What committed?	shakespearean
I will not swear these are my hands.	shakespearean
Did he ask about me?	modern
I’m very glad I came to see you.	modern
Sir, I do know you, And dare upon the warrant of my note Commend a dear thing to you.	shakespearean
Dost fall?	shakespearean
Enter, sir, the castle.	shakespearean
Oh Lorenzo, if you keep your promise to me, I’ll end this agony by becoming a Christian and marrying you.	modern
I noted her not, but I looked on her.	shakespearean
I’ll be back quicker than you can think a thought.	modern
I would rip his heart out in public and eat it.	modern
Sweet friends, to bed.	shakespearean
Come on, i' God’s name, once more toward our father’s.	shakespearean
Fear you the boar, and go so unprovided?	shakespearean
What time is it?	modern
I will not trouble you As yet to question you about your fortunes.— Give us some music, and, good cousin, sing.	shakespearean
Why, Caesar straddles the narrow world like a giant, and we petty men walk under his huge legs and look forward only to dying dishonorably, as slaves.	modern
Quickly send— Be brief in it—to th' castle, for my writ Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia.	shakespearean
Who can be wise, amazed, temp'rate, and furious, Loyal and neutral, in a moment?	shakespearean
You’re forgetting yourself when you back me into a corner.	modern
Well then, sustain me.	shakespearean
Keep listening.	modern
You can do what you want, but he’s an experienced and honorable soldier.	modern
Why, she was dead before you were even born.	modern
Live, live!	modern
I am sure, sweet Kate, this kindness deserves thanks.	modern
A very pleasing night to honest men.	shakespearean
You are welcome here, as are all of you English princes.	modern
For three months.	modern
Come, prepare.	shakespearean
I don’t think it’s a good idea.	modern
And is “pig” not the same as “great,” may I ask?	modern
Officers, take them away.	modern
Who sued to me for him?	shakespearean
I will not come.	shakespearean
Tell the army to flee.	modern
Tis most convenient.	shakespearean
Look, where he comes.	shakespearean
Yes, he has.	modern
Yes, I am.	modern
And now who knows But you, Lorenzo, whether I am yours?	shakespearean
His nurse, grandmother.	modern
Fie, for shame!	shakespearean
Go, coward as thou art.	shakespearean
The gentleman who serves you only for profit And is only superficially loyal to you Will take off when it starts to rain And leave you alone in the storm.	modern
For certain she is dead, and by strange manner.	shakespearean
Lazy people end up at the bottom, and you deserve to be at the top.	modern
But by immortal providence, she’s mine.	shakespearean
Art thou my son?	shakespearean
No Thisbe do I see.	shakespearean
Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?	shakespearean
But don’t take all that pain on yourself.	modern
If you prick us, do we not bleed?	shakespearean
All ready.	shakespearean
Wasn’t Don John at dinner tonight?	modern
Marcus Luccicos, is not he in town?	shakespearean
I know he holds me dear, but I haven’t asked him about the coronation, and he hasn’t told me.	modern
Make assay.	shakespearean
You’re poisoning my eyes.	modern
Yes, just now, my lord.	modern
It was not brought me, my lord.	shakespearean
God forbid!	modern
Are you crazy?	modern
This island belongs to me because Sycorax, my mother, left it to me.	modern
Well, in and of itself, it is a good life, but given that it’s a shepherd’s life, it’s worthless.	modern
Tell me, Voltemand, what’s the news from the king of Norway?	modern
Therefore our everlasting farewell take.	shakespearean
Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.	shakespearean
I’m bleeding, but you didn’t kill me.	modern
Do you see this, O God?	shakespearean
I can suck sadness out of a song the way a weasel sucks eggs.	modern
Let me deal in this.	shakespearean
I can’t talk now.	modern
An if he be not fought withal, my lord, Let us not live in France.	shakespearean
If I can believe my eyes, this is a fine sight to see.	modern
Thou must not take my former sharpness ill.	shakespearean
Octavia weeps To part from Rome.	shakespearean
Sir, sir, that can’t be true.	modern
O thou pernicious caitiff!	shakespearean
March gently on to meet him.	shakespearean
Smile, then, on this beautiful union.	modern
The Duke and any of my fellow senators will take this wrong as seriously as if it were their own.	modern
We are men, my liege.	shakespearean
Swallows have built In Cleopatra’s sails their nests.	shakespearean
I admire your efforts, and all of you will share the rewards.	modern
Me too, Lord!	modern
Well, if you could have just an inch of better fortune than me, where would you like the improvement?	modern
Haply a woman’s voice may do some good, When articles too nicely urged be stood on.	shakespearean
And smelt so?	shakespearean
The old guy.	modern
Oh, lieutenant!	modern
I have drunk but one cup tonight, and that was craftily qualified too, and behold what innovation it makes here.	shakespearean
Be happy about it.	modern
And what did Surrey say to that?	modern
I was about to swear that I loved you.	modern
Mark Antony I served, who best was worthy Best to be served.	shakespearean
But, my good lord, the words of you and Lord Buckingham are as trustworthy to me as if I had seen and heard him speak myself.	modern
More, Domitius: My lord desires you presently.	shakespearean
He’s praying now.	modern
Come, I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber.	shakespearean
Well met, Corporal Nym.	shakespearean
That’s certain—if the devil may be her judge.	shakespearean
Yea, very force entangles Itself with strength.	shakespearean
Though he be as good a gentleman as the devil is, as Lucifer and Beelzebub himself, it is necessary, look your Grace, that he keep his vow and his oath.	shakespearean
He lays it on.	shakespearean
And what’s the point, sir?	modern
Well done!	modern
Say she be mute and will not speak a word; Then I’ll commend her volubility, And say she uttereth piercing eloquence.	shakespearean
That’s no way to pray.	modern
Through the sharp hawthorn blows the cold wind.	shakespearean
Ever since Cordelia left for France, sir, the fool has been depressed.	modern
Do not, my lord.	shakespearean
Why, as I told thee, ’tis a custom with him, I' th' afternoon to sleep.	shakespearean
So submit to my mercy or, like men who revel in their own destruction, challenge me to do my worst.	modern
In my imagination, Horatio.	modern
you will  And what if he won’t stop?	modern
It must appear in other ways than words, Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy.	shakespearean
And I am, I am.	modern
O plague right well prevented!	shakespearean
And I do not doubt but to hear them say, “It is a sweet comedy.” No more words.	shakespearean
Tis certain, every man that dies ill, the ill upon his own head.	shakespearean
How do you feel, Laertes?	modern
Here in these confines slyly have I lurked To watch the waning of mine enemies.	shakespearean
Assemble our squadrons on the other side of the hill, in sight of Caesar’s navy.	modern
Farewell, good Salisbury; and may good luck go with you.	modern
Who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves”!	shakespearean
Well, go to, I will.	shakespearean
Then think about how shameful it would be for you to give in to his seductive talk and surrender your treasure chest to his greedy hands.	modern
And his kinsman too.	shakespearean
An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.	shakespearean
My vision is dull.	modern
I wish she were in heaven so she could appeal to some power to make this dog Jew change his mind.	modern
I gave you all— And in good time you gave it.	shakespearean
Live a little, comfort a little, cheer thyself a little.	shakespearean
Go to him from me.	modern
He is made of treachery, and has run away to avoid his crimes.	modern
Has he, masters?	shakespearean
Nay, I dare not swear it.	shakespearean
O these deliberate fools!	shakespearean
Who is to blame for this: Antony or I?	modern
It would become me As well as it does you, and I should do it With much more ease, for my good will is to it And yours it is against.	shakespearean
My gracious sovereign.	shakespearean
O Scotland, Scotland!	shakespearean
Tell me for more certainty, Albeit I’ll swear that I do know your tongue.	shakespearean
Now, infidel, I have you on the hip.	shakespearean
Your vessels and your spells provide, Your charms and everything beside.	shakespearean
Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral; And there they hull, expecting but the aid Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore.	shakespearean
You must not, sir, mistake my niece.	shakespearean
This is what happens when you act rashly.	modern
Come sit on me.	modern
God bless you for doing this.	modern
But ’tis not so above.	shakespearean
And love doesn’t have good judgment either—Cupid, has wings and no eyes, so he’s bound to be reckless and hasty.	modern
An excellent motion.	modern
Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,	shakespearean
The court awards it, and the law doth give it.	shakespearean
No, wait.	modern
The worm that’s fled Hath nature that in time will venom breed; No teeth for th' present.	shakespearean
It is to be all made of sighs and tears, And so am I for Phoebe.	shakespearean
Who do you think?	modern
Poor prattler, how thou talk’st!	shakespearean
Is ’t come to this?	shakespearean
Risk everything for lead?	modern
I believe you are, Regan.	modern
And yet I do thee wrong to mind thee of it, For thou art framed of the firm truth of valor.	shakespearean
Me, ma'am?	modern
He’s coming, ma'am.	modern
When are you getting married, madam?	modern
What follows, then, my lord?	shakespearean
Don’t keep anything back, I insist.	modern
What’s this?	modern
Yes, dear madam.	modern
Now I change my mind, And partly credit things that do presage.	shakespearean
What else can I say?	modern
But men tend to interpret things however suits them and totally miss the actual meaning of the things themselves.	modern
Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home, And so am come abroad to see the world.	shakespearean
Oh, Regan, Goneril, your kind old father whose generous heart gave you everything—Oh, if I think about that I’ll go mad.	modern
But you would be more honorable if you changed your mind.	modern
Sweet Phoebe, have pity on me.	modern
Pardon me, lords and gentlemen who stayed awake.	modern
They’re entirely welcome.	modern
No, my lord.	modern
How dost thou, Guildenstern?	shakespearean
It’s always better to get rid of what you’re scared of than to be afraid.	modern
We first address towards you, who with this king Hath rivaled for our daughter.	shakespearean
In my mind’s eye, Horatio.	shakespearean
How are you?	modern
All dead.	shakespearean
Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.	shakespearean
But you’ll have to catch me!	modern
Well, we shall sift him.—Welcome, my good friends!	shakespearean
Where wilt thou lead me?	shakespearean
Through the house give glimmering light, By the dead and drowsy fire.	shakespearean
And when I have my meed, I will away, For this will out, and then I must not stay.	shakespearean
On what compulsion must I?	shakespearean
Then there were two cousins laid up, when the one should be lamed with reasons and the other mad without any.	shakespearean
Where left we last?	shakespearean
I don’t think there’s a man under the sun who’s worse at hiding his love or hate than Richard.	modern
What news?	shakespearean
Lysander, where are you going with all this?	modern
I met Venus as she was with her son on her way to her home on Paphos, in a carriage pulled by doves.	modern
But who comes here?	shakespearean
We will wait on you, your majesty.	modern
That high All-seer which I dallied with Hath turned my feignèd prayer on my head And given in earnest what I begged in jest.	shakespearean
Think upon Vaughan, and with guilty fear Let fall thy lance.	shakespearean
Will not he?	shakespearean
But do you really think the Prince would treat you that way?	modern
I’d do it myself, but I can’t leave my post.	modern
Tell the king what was happening in the battle when you left it.	modern
My fool usurps my body.	shakespearean
Then, masters, look to see a troublous world.	shakespearean
Pray you do not, sir.	shakespearean
Because I’m a Jew.	modern
My lord, I am for you, though it cost me ten nights' watchings.	shakespearean
Say this becomes him— As his composure must be rare indeed Whom these things cannot blemish—yet must Antony No way excuse his foils when we do bear So great weight in his lightness.	shakespearean
I will have when you hear the rest of what I have to say.	modern
Good duke, receive thy daughter.	shakespearean
Sleep thou, and I will wind thee in my arms.	shakespearean
Help me, ladies!	modern
I have not seen him this two days.	shakespearean
Who’s this?	modern
This is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man’s funeral.	shakespearean
Come, shall we go and kill us venison?	shakespearean
When she is like this, besides walking and performing various activities, have you heard her say anything?	modern
This is the very ecstasy of love, Whose violent property fordoes itself And leads the will to desperate undertakings As oft as any passion under heaven That does afflict our natures.	shakespearean
I see a voice.	shakespearean
Well, did you think about what I said?	modern
The son of Clarence have I pent up close, His daughter meanly have I matched in marriage, The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham’s bosom, And Anne my wife hath bid this world goodnight.	shakespearean
When saw you my father last?	shakespearean
All my pretty ones?	shakespearean
Are you talking, you villain?	modern
Can he even get angry?	modern
If so, when it’s day, where are you going to find a cave dark enough to hide your monstrous face?	modern
So, I won’t.	modern
Let’s say goodbye to him.	modern
Ho, now you strike like the blind man.	shakespearean
I’d heard about my brother’s plan and have been subtly trying to change his mind, but he’s determined.	modern
How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!	shakespearean
I’m going to England.	modern
You saw eternity in my lips and eyes, and happiness in the arch of my eyebrows.	modern
Go with me, Silvius.	shakespearean
Why, what did he do?	modern
And how did you get in here?	modern
I believe I have some choice in the matter, sir.	modern
All that is spoke is marred.	shakespearean
All disconsolate, With Pindarus his bondman on this hill.	shakespearean
Don’t let us talk you into anything, but consider carefully the value of our offers.	modern
Not a soul But felt a fever of the mad and played Some tricks of desperation.	shakespearean
Ay, marry, sir, now it begins to work.	shakespearean
I’ll to my charge.	shakespearean
Sooth, la, I’ll help.	shakespearean
I do entreat you, not a man depart, Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.	shakespearean
I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of Richard, Earl of Cambridge.	shakespearean
Here, I give you my blessing again.	modern
May good luck follow you!	modern
I haven’t seen him recently.	modern
Please, father, since you’re weak, act like it.	modern
It’s fair for him to treat me like this, very fair.	modern
You look like you have something more to say.	modern
I will not take her on gift of any man.	shakespearean
And so, my lord, adieu.	shakespearean
Where is thy husband now?	shakespearean
But till that time Come not thou near me.	shakespearean
I know it’s the moon.	modern
My brother has a daughter who looks exactly like Hero; this girl is heir to both our estates.	modern
I am sure, sweet Kate, this kindness merits thanks.	shakespearean
Come on, take control of your feelings.	modern
Is this true?	modern
You don’t know?	modern
I care not.	shakespearean
But small to greater matters must give way.	shakespearean
Oh, Caesar, this Charmian lived until a moment ago.	modern
But we have reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal stings, our unbitted lusts.	shakespearean
Do not you hear a cry?	shakespearean
How fine my master is!	shakespearean
I mean in singing.	shakespearean
I was forbid it.	shakespearean
Do you perceive in all this noble company Where most you owe obedience?	shakespearean
Sir boy, I’ll whip you from your foining fence, Nay, as I am a gentleman, I will.	shakespearean
Come talk to me tomorrow as early as you can.—Come with me, my dear love.	modern
Yes, kind sister.	modern
If he did that, it would be a charitable deed to hang him.	modern
Oh, these flaws and starts, Impostors to true fear, would well become A woman’s story at a winter’s fire, Authorized by her grandam.	shakespearean
Dost thou not see my baby at my breast, That sucks the nurse asleep?	shakespearean
Really, I’m only pretending to be him.	modern
I didn’t, my lord.	modern
A beast, no more.	shakespearean
Performing is activity, and he is always doing that.	modern
I will not.	shakespearean
You are too indulgent.	shakespearean
Look to your house, your daughter, and your bags!	shakespearean
Don’t think I blame you.	modern
There is a river in Macedon, and there is likewise a river in Monmouth.	modern
That death’s unnatural that kills for loving.	shakespearean
First kiss me, Kate, and we will.	shakespearean
Don’t trust rotten planks.	modern
Whichever hand literally stabbed their tender hearts, you’re the one who gave the order.	modern
I will not trouble thee, my child.	shakespearean
What says Lord Stanley?	shakespearean
If he becomes pale, I know what to do.	modern
Why, anything.	shakespearean
Music i’ th’ air.	shakespearean
Do you know why the King of France suddenly went back home?	modern
Go away, get out of here, and stop following me.	modern
Yes, here it is.	modern
But will my Rosalind do so?	shakespearean
Quiet, everyone!	modern
You haven’t heard of the war brewing between the Dukes of Cornwall and Albany?	modern
While he was yet in Rome His power went out in such distractions as Beguiled all spies.	shakespearean
What you were afraid of has happened.	modern
We’ll revenge his death.	modern
What else?	modern
If he doesn’t show up, the play is ruined.	modern
With half the world opposing the other half, it wasn’t the time for Antony, the pivotal player, to let love distract him.	modern
A simple countryman that brought her figs.	shakespearean
I’m no less noble than you are, Edmund.	modern
Fortune is merry, And in this mood will give us anything.	shakespearean
Should we see what he thinks?	modern
Say to the king I would attend his leisure For a few words.	shakespearean
Please go inside.	modern
The level meadow, where the freckled cowslip, burnet, and green clover once grew, has become useless: unmowed, it grows to seed, so that nothing springs up but weeds, rough thistles, barren plants, and burs.	modern
If the English had any sense, they would run away.	modern
Rosalind, I have to leave you for two hours.	modern
Yes, I do.	modern
Good Lord, how bright and goodly shines the moon!	shakespearean
Not if you want to keep your arms!	modern
A snake did do it, because no snake ever had a more forked, lying tongue than you have.	modern
You opposed my taking part in the war.	modern
Trust me, you could slide all the way from my shoulder to my heel taking no more of a running start than the distance between my head and my neck.	modern
Why, a horse.	shakespearean
And what said Surrey then?	shakespearean
The king has been informed of all their plans, but they have no idea.	modern
Beat him up.	modern
Seest not?	shakespearean
Out o' th' moon, I do assure thee.	shakespearean
Macbeth Is ripe for shaking, and the powers above Put on their instruments.	shakespearean
I shall, my lord.	shakespearean
Just as I did with the meat, I’ll make up some problem with the way the bed is made, and throw the pillow one way and the cushion the other, and the blanket over here and the sheets over there.	modern
Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold In him that did object the same to thee!	shakespearean
Caesar is sad, and Lepidus, Since Pompey’s feast, as Menas says, is troubled With the greensickness.	shakespearean
He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found The head and source of all your son’s distemper.	shakespearean
Just a minute ago I heard you say you didn’t like it when Cassio left my wife.	modern
Is ’t possible?	shakespearean
Yes, his chest!	modern
You should ask me what time o' day.	shakespearean
Sir, I know I’m not a flatterer.	modern
None, man.	shakespearean
Nay, the man hath no wit that cannot, from the rising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb, vary deserved praise on my palfrey.	shakespearean
Please, leave it here.	modern
I am for the air.	shakespearean
The obscure bird Clamored the livelong night.	shakespearean
Ay, go your ways, go your ways.	shakespearean
Remember it, my lord?	shakespearean
Men must not walk too late.	shakespearean
Let any man perish who isn’t ready now!	modern
Oh, kill me!	modern
Look at him.	modern
I passed, methought, the melancholy flood, With that sour ferryman which poets write of, Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.	shakespearean
Come, let’s away to prison.	shakespearean
I am glad of your departure.	shakespearean
The starry welkin cover thou anon With drooping fog as black as Acheron, And lead these testy rivals so astray As one come not within another’s way.	shakespearean
Yes, and I’ll give it to him for free.	modern
Hang our flags on the outer walls.	modern
I did not think he had been acquainted with her.	shakespearean
My more particular, And that which most with you should safe my going, Is Fulvia’s death.	shakespearean
Leonato, am I standing here?	modern
You must say “paragon.” A “paramour” is, God bless us, a thing of naught.	shakespearean
I dare not, dear, Dear my lord, pardon, I dare not, Lest I be taken.	shakespearean
Ay, sir.	shakespearean
Right away, Caesar.	modern
A wandering knight?	shakespearean
It’s meant in good will.	modern
Let us die.	shakespearean
O, come in, equivocator.	shakespearean
Tis thus: Who tells me true, though in his tale lie death, I hear him as he flattered.	shakespearean
Stands Scotland where it did?	shakespearean
I can see what’s in broad daylight.	modern
Oh, how I long to have some chat with her!	shakespearean
The street is narrow here.	modern
Were it good, think you?	shakespearean
Away, get out of here.	modern
It seems not.	modern
Let’s go to him.	modern
If it were now to die, 'Twere now to be most happy, for I fear My soul hath her content so absolute That not another comfort like to this Succeeds in unknown fate.	shakespearean
Let me but meet you ladies one hour hence, And I’ll salute your Grace of York as mother And reverend looker-on, of two fair queens.	shakespearean
Sir, this should be answered.	shakespearean
I’m not scared of you.	modern
We have no friend But resolution, and the briefest end.	shakespearean
Benedick’s heart is like a bell, with his tongue as the clapper: everything his heart thinks, his tongue speaks.	modern
In order to make your company even more enjoyable, I’m going to keep to myself until suppertime.	modern
Excellent, good.	modern
Come hither, sirrah.	shakespearean
No, I’ll slit the nose of the villain who would have sent me to jail.	modern
Well, not in deed, madam, since I can’t do anything unchaste.	modern
If it be mine, Keep it not from me.	shakespearean
That must mean a sword.	modern
But my daughter should know about this, so she can be prepared with an answer just in case.	modern
But why should honor outlive honesty?	shakespearean
Just now, my lord.	modern
Like gambling, sir?	modern
We’ll speak again tomorrow.	modern

Come on, what would you say about me?	modern
Take my hand, Hastings.	modern
My lord, I don’t know what’s going on, but it seems to me that your highness isn’t being treated as politely as before.	modern

Do, do.	shakespearean
And tell the Dauphin His jest will savor but of shallow wit When thousands weep more than did laugh at it.	shakespearean
I thank you most for him.	shakespearean
Dost thou hold there still?	shakespearean
Then see a good one for me.	modern
It shall be to your good, for my father’s house and all the revenue that was old Sir Rowland’s will I estate upon you, and here live and die a shepherd.	shakespearean

John Duke of Norfolk, Walter, Lord Ferrers, Sir Robert Brakenbury, and Sir William Brandon.	shakespearean
He has one ship bound for Tripoli, another heading for the Indies.	modern

So much for praising myself, who, I myself will bear witness, is praiseworthy.	shakespearean
He can’t possibly be such a monster— And I’m sure he isn’t.	modern
So the maid that stood in the way for my wish shall show me the way to my will.	shakespearean

It was he That made the overture of thy treasons to us, Who is too good to pity thee.	shakespearean
I’m going to cry.	modern
Or I have no observance.	shakespearean
Thou speak’st wiser than thou art ware of.	shakespearean
Damn it, show me what you’re going to do for her.	modern
If you had, the kings that have revolted and the soldier that deserted this morning would still be behind you.	modern
No, I won’t.	modern
I’ve got some business to take care of.	modern
While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.	shakespearean

Tis done by me, and ends in “Margaret.”   Thus have you breathed your curse against yourself.	shakespearean
Who alone suffers, suffers most i' th' mind, Leaving free things and happy shows behind.	shakespearean

Prove you are worthy of your birth, which I do not doubt for a moment.	modern
Go and say We purpose her no shame.	shakespearean
I don’t know what to say.	modern
But, uncle, you know how to bear with him.	modern
But we haven’t made any preparations.	modern

No one may be bolder than my Lord Hastings.	modern
When I left him, he was less than nine miles from here.	modern
Kings have trembled to kiss this hand.	modern
Tis sport to maul a runner.	shakespearean
We’ll to th’ river.	shakespearean
Leave me alone to woo him.	shakespearean
Now, fellows, you are welcome.	shakespearean
Come, sit, sit, and a song.	shakespearean
What does this say?	modern
Captain Macmorris, if you take my words in some way other than how they were meant, see, I’ll have to think you’re not treating me with the good will you ought to, see, since I am as good a man as yourself, both in the practice of war and in my country of origin and in other respects.	modern
I don’t love Hermia; I love Helena.	modern

Good-bye, my lord.	modern
Then thus: Baptista is safe, talking with the deceiving father of a deceitful son.	shakespearean
Is that a good idea, do you think?	modern
The less they deserve, the more your generosity is worth.	modern
After all, who would put up with all life’s humiliations—the abuse from superiors, the insults of arrogant men, the pangs of unrequited love, the inefficiency of the legal system, the rudeness of people in office, and the mistreatment good people have to take from bad—when you could simply take out your knife and call it quits?	modern
If that’s not enough, I’ll sign a contract to pay ten times that much, and I’ll give you my hands, my head, and my heart as security.	modern
Unfaithful, my lord?	modern
Your bedchamber.	shakespearean
Tell her that the king, who has the power to command people, asks her.	modern

Actually, I should.	modern
Nay, stay.	shakespearean
I will stop your mouth.	shakespearean

Let’s do that, Lysander.	modern
Go back to bed.	modern
Damn it all!	modern
Not in deed, madam, for I can do nothing But what indeed is honest to be done.	shakespearean

Goodbye, you dumb old spirit.	modern
Appear and pertly!— No tongue.	shakespearean
True, my good boy.—Come, bring us to this hovel.	shakespearean

My lord, your son has paid the soldier’s price: death.	modern
I was provokèd by her sland'rous tongue, That laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.	shakespearean
I protest I love thee.	shakespearean
Did he cry?	modern
If it be so, It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows That ever I have felt.	shakespearean

There thou mightst behold the great image of authority: a dog’s obeyed in office.	shakespearean
What’s that noise?	modern
The age is grown so picked that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he galls his kibe.—How long hast thou been a grave-maker?	shakespearean
Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damned, Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell, Be thy intents wicked or charitable, Thou comest in such a questionable shape That I will speak to thee.	shakespearean
Were he not warmed with ale, This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly.	shakespearean
You’ll pay me the eight shillings I won of you at betting?	shakespearean
But if he be at hand I shall be satisfied.	shakespearean
I’ll yield my legions and cavalry to Caesar.	modern
We’ll see our husbands Before they think of us.	shakespearean

Or he that slew her brothers and her uncles?	shakespearean
You have been hotly called for.	shakespearean
Was it you that was always plotting to kill him?	modern
That’s why your desires are wolfish, bloody, and ravenous.	modern
What committed?	shakespearean
Did you think I was talking about sex?	modern
Prepare yourself, please, for this trip.	modern
Good morning, my noble lord.	modern
She’s well.	modern
Be quiet!	modern
There is but one hope in it that can do you any good, and that is but a kind of bastard hope neither.	shakespearean
Tis true, my lords, he did.	shakespearean
They swore that you were well-nigh dead for me.	shakespearean
In the meantime, come home with me, and when the time is right I’ll take you to talk to him.	modern
I beseech you, sir, go.	shakespearean

Good roaring, Lion!	modern
But, in good sooth, are you he that hangs the verses on the trees wherein Rosalind is so admired?	shakespearean

Oh angels, protect us!	modern
Out, out, brief candle.	modern
Just do it carefully.—And to think that the noble and loyal Kent has been banished, for the crime of telling the truth!	modern
Am I not stayed for, Cinna?	shakespearean

Most mischievous foul sin in chiding sin, For thou thyself hast been a libertine, As sensual as the brutish sting itself, And all th' embossèd sores and headed evils That thou with license of free foot hast caught Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.	shakespearean
Thou hast braved many men; brave not me.	shakespearean
With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife.	shakespearean

How are things going now?	modern
A man may see how this world goes with no eyes.	shakespearean
How fares my lord?	shakespearean
He almost begs for the opportunity to help you.	modern
Bid him therefore consider of his ransom, which must proportion the losses we have borne, the subjects we have lost, the disgrace we have digested, which, in weight to reanswer, his pettiness would bow under.	shakespearean

As much unto my good Lord Chamberlain.	shakespearean
Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.	shakespearean
I take this offer then: pay the bond thrice And let the Christian go.	shakespearean
Not honestly, my lord, but so covertly that no dishonesty shall appear in me.	shakespearean
I confess it is my shame to be so fond, but it is not in my virtue to amend it.	shakespearean
Look like th' innocent flower, But be the serpent under ’t.	shakespearean
Please invite them in.	modern
He’s not wise enough to be brave.	modern
Wherein went he?	shakespearean
If that’s all, gentlemen, I see no problem.	modern
My husband lost his life to get the crown, and my sons' fortunes have been tossed up and down, leaving me to rejoice over their victories and weep over their losses.	modern
Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me?	shakespearean
Even good men have bad luck.	modern
I’ll not answer that But say it is my humour.	shakespearean
England would be lucky to have this virtuous prince as king.	modern
The general got rid of us early tonight so he could be with Desdemona.—I can’t blame him.	modern

Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.	shakespearean
For she his hairy temples then had rounded With a coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers, And that same dew, which sometime on the buds Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls, Stood now within the pretty flowerets' eyes Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.	shakespearean
Listen, Guildenstern, and you too, Rosencrantz—listen as close as you can!	modern
I am more proud to be Sir Rowland’s son, His youngest son, and would not change that calling To be adopted heir to Frederick.	shakespearean

No, I’ll not weep.	shakespearean
Good luck, fair gentleman.	modern
We cannot fight for love as men can.	modern
Swear by her foot, that she may tread out the oath.	shakespearean
I regret my crime more than my death, and I beg your Highness to forgive me, while punishing my body with death.	modern
Therefore, all lovers should speak for themselves.	modern
He might have chid me so, for, in good faith, I am a child to chiding.	shakespearean
Pray heavens he be, For I have served him, and the man commands Like a full soldier.	shakespearean
Look at you, standing there in a stupor!	modern
If it be found so, some will dear abide it.	shakespearean
Look how they kiss and carry on!	modern
They can sit out there until they die of hunger and disease.	modern
I’m coming.	modern
He hath given his empire Up to a whore; who now are levying The kings o’ th’ earth for war.	shakespearean
Then we’ll go out, even to the marketplace, and, waving our bloody swords over our heads, let’s cry, “Peace, freedom, and liberty!” Kneel then, and wash.	modern
And when she speaks, doesn’t her voice stir up passion?	modern
Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell.	shakespearean
Directly, I am going to Caesar’s funeral.	shakespearean
It was mine art, When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape The pine and let thee out.	shakespearean
It’s strongest in the strongest people.	modern
That she’s the chosen of Signior Hortensio.	shakespearean
Pray you Be ever known to patience.	shakespearean
Well, let’s get out of here and tell Macbeth what we did accomplish.	modern

What news?	shakespearean
Anyway, I have to say goodbye to you now.	modern
That’s the next thing on the agenda.	modern
In your own kingdom, sir.	shakespearean
Post back with speed, and tell him what hath chanced.	shakespearean
Rogue, thou hast lived too long.	shakespearean
The pig, or the great, or the mighty, or the huge, or the magnanimous are all one reckonings, save the phrase is a little variations.	shakespearean
Peter Quince— What is it, jolly Bottom?	modern
His arrival fits perfectly into my plan.	modern
Calphurnia, my wife, is keeping me at home.	modern
Do you smell something naughty?	modern
Then, in the name of God and all these rights, Advance your standards.	shakespearean
The next day I explained all this to him, which was as good as begging his pardon.	modern
Yea, that she did.	shakespearean
Where are you going?	modern
Though I am not a flattering, righteous man, at least you can say that I am honest about being a villain.	modern
Antony’s wife should have an army to escort her, with neighing horses to announce her arrival long before she appears.	modern
I won’t bother with it.	modern
The duke will be here tonight?	modern
As strange as the thing I know not.	shakespearean
I could take back my crown by force—What outrageous ingratitude!	modern
Get them in here—Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Philip, Walter, Sugarsop, and the rest.	modern
They are all welcome.	shakespearean
Don’t ask me what I know.	modern
Hail to your majesty.	modern
He drinks like this every night before he goes to sleep.	modern
Calm down.	modern
Young Prince Edward is still alive—what do you think I’m going to say next?	modern
Peace, you dull fool.	shakespearean
My beautiful warrior!	modern
But good lieutenant, is your general wived?	shakespearean
Or just a foretaste of it?	modern
Tell him we could have driven him back at Harfleur but thought it unwise to burst a pustule before it had fully ripened.	modern
Did the brothers-in-law leave?	modern
Ah, but I know you.	modern
And me too, good Lord!	shakespearean
That must be because you’re so ambitious.	modern
Wherever he goes, he inspires compassion and people turn against us.	modern
What’s that to thee?	shakespearean
I will hear Cassius and compare their reasons When severally we hear them renderèd.	shakespearean
You are what’s left of the noblest man that ever lived.	modern
What is that noise?	shakespearean
Foul deeds will rise, Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men’s eyes.	shakespearean
This chatter is no cure for my toothache.	modern
What is ’t o'clock?	shakespearean
Is everything ready for that event?	modern
A man who achieves more in war than his captain does becomes his captain’s rival.	modern
The herb I showed thee once.	shakespearean
Since the torch is out, Lie down and stray no farther.	shakespearean
I have no gift for the one and no strength for the other, though I have the gift of strength.	modern
That’s as much as to say, the sweet youth’s in love.	shakespearean
We will go walk a little in the orchard, And then to dinner.	shakespearean
That’s as we list to grace him.	shakespearean
I’ll recite something for you, guy.	modern
The blows I gave you already will make up for your upsetting me.	modern
That’s what the bill says.	modern
Lay forth the gown.	shakespearean
Why should Titania cross her Oberon?	shakespearean
I hope God makes you happy again, like you once were.	modern
Is it lost?	modern
That’s right, uncle, talk to your heart, like the  Good morning to you both.	modern
Goodbye, Edmund.	modern
Here’s to you, Menas.	modern
Yes, yes.	modern
When devils are about to commit their biggest sins they put on their most heavenly faces, just like I’m doing now.	modern
You have not been abed, then?	shakespearean
It’s time to reassess the situation.	modern
No one here is affected by your curse, because curses are just words with no power.	modern
I didn’t expect any better from him once he got involved with Mistress Shore.	modern
But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed, one that in the authority of her merit did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself?	shakespearean
And I for Ganymede.	shakespearean
But in return, please, do one thing for me: leave me alone for a little while.	modern
I wish that were true for both our sakes!	modern
Come then, kiss me and take the last bit of warmth from my lips.	modern
Has he ever tested out these ideas on you before?	modern
Now this is where you come in.	modern
And listen!	modern
But jealous people don’t think like that.	modern
What “passion”?	modern
When I have praised Antony, I’ve disparaged Caesar.	modern
Does he reward my dedicated service with such deep contempt?	modern
My old friend Grumio and my good friend Petruchio?	shakespearean
How are you, my lord?	modern
But goodbye.	modern
Fetch the will hither, and we shall determine How to cut off some charge in legacies.	shakespearean
Help me out of here.	modern
Speak confidently.	modern
They know By th’ height, the lowness, or the mean, if dearth Or foison follow.	shakespearean
My excellent good friends!	shakespearean
It used to be the last ditch comfort of miserable people.	modern
He received me with courtesy and sufficient respect, but not with affection, nor with as much open and friendly conversation as he once greeted me.	modern
Speak it again and, even with the word, This hand, which for thy love did kill thy love, Shall for thy love kill a far truer love.	shakespearean
Why, what else?	shakespearean
Of course he is, and so are you.	modern
Bring me just notice of the numbers dead On both our parts.	shakespearean
Is supper ready, the house trimmed, rushes strewed, cobwebs swept, the servingmen in their new fustian, their white stockings, and every officer his wedding garment on?	shakespearean
Do you withdraw yourself a little while,	shakespearean
I know I cannot please you.	shakespearean
But since the affairs of men rest still incertain, Let’s reason with the worst that may befall.	shakespearean
Peace, ho!	shakespearean
What, are you moaning on about your toothache?	modern
Heavens keep him from these beasts!	shakespearean
It is not so expressed, but what of that?	shakespearean
If th' other two be brained like us, the state totters.	shakespearean
I think this night is just like sick daylight.	modern
What, shall I find you here?	shakespearean
I cannot go no further.	shakespearean
He passes some humors and careers.	shakespearean
My hair doth stand an end to hear her curses.	shakespearean
Macbeth!— Had I three ears, I’d hear thee.	shakespearean
Now, good Metellus, go along by him.	shakespearean
Her father is Baptista Minola, a pleasant and courteous gentleman.	modern
The king made peace among all of us.	modern
Oh, Stephano, two men from Naples survived!	modern
There wasn’t any problem.	modern
I said she was.	modern
Well, I’ll go to Scone.	modern
Come on now, wine is good for you, if you know how to use it.	modern
The only kind of tears you should shed in this case are the kind you might get from holding an onion to your nose.	modern
She’s dead to me.	modern
What, are we having a feast?	modern
O sir, you are old.	shakespearean
I will sit here in the middle.	modern
At such a time I’ll loose my daughter to him.	shakespearean
Cassio doesn’t know you.	modern
No more of that.	shakespearean
Go to, farewell.	shakespearean
And yet for all that, if she didn’t hate him to death, she’d love him to death.	modern
What wouldst thou do, old man?	shakespearean
What are you then determinèd to do?	shakespearean
Our friendship in our schooldays, our childhood innocence?	modern
Where is Metellus Cimber?	shakespearean
But you turn that sun into a shadow.	modern
O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear.	shakespearean
Be pleased to tell us— For this is from the present—how you take The offers we have sent you.	shakespearean
It shall be seven ere I go to horse.	shakespearean
Offer yourself more respect, or—not to beat this word to death—you’ll offer me the chance to be a laughing-stock.	modern
But he’s sleeping.	modern
Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius, To cut the head off and then hack the limbs, Like wrath in death and envy afterwards, For Antony is but a limb of Caesar.	shakespearean
Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself Are much condemned to have an itching palm, To sell and mart your offices for gold To undeservers.	shakespearean
Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide, Hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit To his full height.	shakespearean
Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me!	shakespearean
My spells are working well, my spirits are obeying me, and everything is right on schedule.	modern
When we see that our betters have the same problems we do, we can almost forget our own misery.	modern
Friends, go.	modern
But I will acquaint my daughter withal, that she may be the better prepared for an answer if peradventure this be true.	shakespearean
We’ll hear it, Antony.	shakespearean
It’s only going to make you sad, Monsieur Jaques.	modern
What do you think of these quick-witted folks, Gremio?	modern
The throng that follows Caesar at the heels, Of senators, of praetors, common suitors, Will crowd a feeble man almost to death.	shakespearean
Speak not so grossly.—You are all amazed.	shakespearean
God restore you to health!	shakespearean
Who can tell me who I am?	modern
Swell, bosom, with thy fraught, For ’tis of aspics' tongues!	shakespearean
The treacherous weapon is right in your hand, sharp and dipped in poison.	modern
What’s the “seventh cause”?	modern
Tut, tut, my lord, we will not stand to prate.	shakespearean
I dare damnation.	shakespearean
Ophelia, walk you here.	shakespearean
Well, is it not news that Petruchio’s coming?	modern
That’s what I hear.	modern
What mercy can you render him, Antonio?	shakespearean
I’ll do anything you ask.	modern
You told me you salute not at the court but you kiss your hands.	shakespearean
Mark me.	shakespearean
Shame on you!	modern
Sorry I am my noble cousin should Suspect me that I mean no good to him.	shakespearean
If I quench thee, thou flaming minister, I can again thy former light restore Should I repent me.	shakespearean
Time ambles for both men.	modern
My lord, I’ll say goodbye now.	modern
If my eyes aren’t deceiving me, goodbye, love.	modern
News, lads, Our wars are done!	shakespearean
I think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage than the love of the parties.	shakespearean
Why so pale, my friend?	modern
The flags have fallen.	modern
And so, with no money at all and a little more wit, return again to Venice.	shakespearean
Oh, but she is wise.	shakespearean
But for all this thou shalt have as many dolors for thy daughters as thou canst tell in a year.	shakespearean
Beware of the devil.	modern
Peace, you were best.	shakespearean
Thou art a fellow of a good respect.	shakespearean
I’ve almost missed the time he requested.	modern
And you must think people are stupid if you believe they wouldn’t realize all the motives you have for trying to kill me.” Oh, how monstrously evil!	modern
I do believe it, and I ask your pardon.	shakespearean
Your case is better than that.	modern
So, again, good night.	shakespearean
Oh, widow Dido?	shakespearean
He picked out the letter “G” from the alphabet and said a wizard told him that “G” will take the throne away from his children.	modern
In every good thing they do.	modern
Oh, I could play the woman with mine eyes And braggart with my tongue!	shakespearean
Ah, all you up in heaven!	modern
I think he will carry this island home in his pocket and give it his son for an apple.	shakespearean
If I can tell him that you have submitted to him sweetly, he’ll request your assistance in finding ways in which he can support you.	modern
He’s a good fellow, I can tell you that.	shakespearean
If she sends any letters to Richmond, you will be accountable to me for it.	modern
I’ve always been straightforward with you, so now I’m telling you what I think.	modern
Please walk softly, so not even a mole hears us approach.	modern
You abused me to my face.	modern
We can’t waste time between now and six o'clock.	modern
Look upon Caesar.	shakespearean
Sit, sir.	shakespearean
Hath he provided this music?	shakespearean
Keep thee warm.	shakespearean
This is some monster of the island, with four legs, who seems to me to have some kind of ache.	modern
We were about to have our noses snapped off by two old men with no teeth.	modern
Therefore my age is as a lusty winter, Frosty but kindly.	shakespearean
Sir, your age and status inspire more respect than your weapons do.	modern
Oh, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!	shakespearean
Well, I will thither.	shakespearean
Thou hast taken against me a most just exception, but yet I protest I have dealt most directly in thy affair.	shakespearean
Have patience, madam.	shakespearean
Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump, The spirit-stirring drum, th' ear-piercing fife, The royal banner, and all quality, Pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war!	shakespearean
Come, Charmian.	shakespearean
Is Marcus Luccicos in town?	modern
I am a fool To weep at what I am glad of.	shakespearean
No, and she swears she never will.	modern
I pick the younger one.	modern
Why, ’tis not possible.	shakespearean
Drown thyself?	shakespearean
What, does the news only get worse?—Please, Bassanio, I’m half of you, so let me bear half the burden this letter brings you.	modern
Is there no offense in ’t?	shakespearean
No such jade as you, if me you mean.	shakespearean
Pray, then, foresee me one.	shakespearean
I love to argue with him when he’s having one of these fits, because then he always has a lot to say.	modern
I’m too young to remember anything like it.	modern
I tell you, ’tis incredible to believe How much she loves me.	shakespearean
There was never a mother who suffered so much loss.	modern
This is a nasty night to go swimming.	modern
Speak within door.	shakespearean
He is justly served.	shakespearean
Of course I will.	modern
What my lord said I was.	modern
I am ready now.	shakespearean
Here, sir!	modern
Who are you?	modern
He didn’t say anything, he’s reading.	modern
Don’t you care about me?	modern
Then, at my farm I have a hundred milk cows, a hundred and twenty fat oxen in my stables, and all the equipment necessary to maintain them.	modern

I’m not sleepy at all.	modern
That’s what I’m afraid of.	modern
Oh, no.	modern
She was a hellcat in school.	modern
You haven’t seen anything, then?	modern
He had a fever when he was in Spain, And when the fit was on him, I did mark How he did shake.	shakespearean
Whither goest thou?	shakespearean
Come on, then.	modern
I dare avouch it, sir.	shakespearean
I prithee let me have it.	shakespearean
I don’t think about them now.	modern
Hermia’s not holding onto me anymore.	modern
Hold, ho!	shakespearean
Well, enough about them.—Come here, Catesby.	modern
You’re thinking something.	modern
No, I will be the pattern of all patience.	shakespearean
It were a better death than die with mocks, Which is as bad as die with tickling.	shakespearean
Why should you think that I should woo in scorn?	shakespearean
It is the bright day that brings forth the adder And that craves wary walking.	shakespearean
Something’s wrong, the man sounds panicked.	modern
Methoughts I saw a thousand fearful wracks, A thousand men that fishes gnawed upon, Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl, Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels, All scattered in the bottom of the sea.	shakespearean
But hear thee, Gratiano.	shakespearean
Until then, we’ve said enough.	modern
Time calls upon ’s.	shakespearean
Please, don’t take it badly, but I cannot and will not give in to you.	modern
Come with me; I’ll spy under the tents to see if any of my own people plan to desert me.	modern
Be it as you shall privately determine, Either for her stay or going.	shakespearean
I cannot blame you now for weeping.	modern
If he ask for me, I am ill and gone to bed.	shakespearean
Domestic fury and fierce civil strife Shall cumber all the parts of Italy.	shakespearean
Good night, good brother.	modern
Oh, what evil!	modern
Look, the precious Desdemona has arrived on shore.	modern
I think I do.	modern
Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar, I have not slept.	shakespearean
And not a jot of “Tranio” in your mouth.	shakespearean
Oh, Lord, if they were married, they’d drive themselves crazy within a week.	modern
The business of the state does him offence, And he does chide with you.	shakespearean
Give me thy hand.	shakespearean
Alack, alack, Edmund, I like not this unnatural dealing.	shakespearean
My wickedness?	modern
Ladies, you’re dropping bread from the heavens to starving people.	modern
His neigh is like a monarch’s command.	modern
For mine own part, I shall be glad to learn of noble men.	shakespearean
Quiet, quiet!	modern
That you shall surely find him, Lead to the Sagittary the raisèd search, And there will I be with him.	shakespearean
I had rather be a toad And live upon the vapor of a dungeon Than keep a corner in the thing I love For others' uses.	shakespearean
You’d better get me  But does he know that I’m here in the forest and dressed in men’s clothing?	modern
What manner of man?	shakespearean
You stupid cop, stop your violence!	modern
God make incision in thee; thou art raw.	shakespearean
No, not much moved.	shakespearean
Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes, Which after-hours give leisure to repent.	shakespearean
Discuss unto me: art thou officer or art thou base, common, and popular?	shakespearean
I played Julius Caesar.	modern
You, constable, are representing the Prince himself.	modern
It hath made me mad.	shakespearean
The battle on the sea is almost lost.	modern
They call it Agincourt.	shakespearean
No, please.	modern
Let’s away And get our jewels and our wealth together, Devise the fittest time and safest way To hide us from pursuit that will be made After my flight.	shakespearean
But who are you?	modern
Madam, his majesty doth call for you,— And for your Grace, —and yours, my gracious lords.	shakespearean
Think about it.	modern
Who are you talking about, niece?	modern
I have no power over you.	modern
Here let them lie Till famine and the ague eat them up.	shakespearean
It may be his enemy is a gentleman of great sort, quite from the answer of his degree.	shakespearean
I have well approved it, sir.	shakespearean
I know into what straits of fortune she is driven, and it is not impossible to me, if it appear not inconvenient to you, to set her before your eyes tomorrow, human as she is, and without any danger.	shakespearean
I’ll take you to where he sleeps, and you can pound a nail into his head.	modern
Let each man render me his bloody hand.	shakespearean
Warm, o' my troth.	shakespearean
Tell the Duke of Albany to prepare for war immediately.	modern
Oh, lay me by my mistress' side.	shakespearean
Oh, that a man might know The end of this day’s business ere it come!	shakespearean
And though I make this marriage for my peace, I’ th’ East my pleasure lies.	shakespearean
Oh my fair warrior!	shakespearean
Is the throne empty?	modern
And I.	shakespearean
He is a good one, and his worthiness Does challenge much respect.—Come, Desdemona, Once more, well met at Cyprus.	shakespearean
I’ll bet you a hundred marks, my Kate puts her flat on her back.	modern
I hope you’re right.	modern
I accept your devotion with my deepest love.	modern
Men who risk everything hope to make profits.	modern
Content you, gentlemen.	shakespearean
I feel this pinprick.	shakespearean
Foul words is but foul wind, and foul wind is but foul breath, and foul breath is noisome.	shakespearean
O Kate, nice customs curtsy to great kings.	shakespearean
Sweet masters, be patient.	shakespearean
Then Dobbin’s tail must be growing backward.	modern
Nay then, I’ll run.	shakespearean
Believe not so.	shakespearean
Look, Lucius, here’s the book I was searching for.	modern
Tis he that sends us to destroy you here.	shakespearean
These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us.	shakespearean
About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring That she did give me, whose posy was For all the world like cutler’s poetry Upon a knife, “Love me and leave me not.” What talk you of the posy or the value?	shakespearean
My heart’s as black as death.	modern
Oh, what a wonderful son, I can impress my mother!	modern
I don’t have a talent for putting my heart’s feelings into words.	modern
Thus high, by thy advice And thy assistance is King Richard seated.	shakespearean
My thanes and kinsmen, Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland In such an honor named.	shakespearean
Go in, and don’t cry.	modern
What did he do that made him flee this land?	modern
My name is Pistol called.	shakespearean
One thing more rests, that thyself execute, to make one among these wooers.	shakespearean
Are you the slave who, with your slanderous words, killed my innocent child?	modern
The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit.	shakespearean
Why are you crying?	modern
Nor in thine, lord.	shakespearean
I can’t speak anymore.	modern
How long have you been a sectary astronomical?	shakespearean
It doth appear you are a worthy judge.	shakespearean
I pray you, let me look upon the bond.	shakespearean
Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails.	shakespearean
And so she did.	shakespearean
He’ll be a good governor.	modern
We have cause to be glad that matters are so well digested.	shakespearean
For my part, I’m sorry this battle turned into a drinking match.	modern
I am sure the duke Will never grant this forfeiture to hold.	shakespearean
Look, here comes a lover of mine and a lover of hers.	shakespearean
Music feeds the melancholy moods of us lovers.	modern
A deed without a name.	shakespearean
Seest thou here, This is the mouth o' th' cell.	shakespearean
I swear by the heavens, which have grown pale in sympathy with us, I’m going with you, whatever you say.	modern
And from henceforth When you are over-earnest with your Brutus, He’ll think your mother chides and leave you so.	shakespearean
Guys who’d take her with all her faults, provided there were enough money involved.	modern
Is ’t not denounced against us?	shakespearean
We’ll write it in alternating eight- and six-syllable lines, just like in a ballad.	modern
We’ll begin the ceremony the way we hope it will end—with delight.	modern
What did he say the symptoms were?	modern
Mistress, you must come away to your father.	shakespearean
My lady, should I lie in your lap?	modern
This is amazing.	modern
Well then, good bye, my lord.	modern
Awake, I say!	shakespearean
Something’s wrong.	modern
Christ, it’s a disaster.	modern
So that, as clear as is the summer’s sun, King Pepin’s title and Hugh Capet’s claim, King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear To hold in right and title of the female.	shakespearean
Thou changèd and self-covered thing, for shame!	shakespearean
Titania sleeps there sometimes at night, lulled to sleep among the flowers by dances and other delights.	modern
I must leave you.	shakespearean
Nay, he rubs himself with civet.	shakespearean
Ay, two hours together.	shakespearean
Do not you love me?	shakespearean
What, I’m a prisoner?	modern
Come on, please sing.	modern
Why, man?	shakespearean
Please, give my regards to your mother, Mrs. Peapod, and your father, Mr. Peapod.	modern
If our father continues to use his authority as usual, then his recent abdication of the kingdom will just hurt us.	modern
That’s what I thought too, sir.	modern
How’s everyone in Verona?	modern
Oh, he’s a dangerously clever boy—bold, quick-witted, capable.	modern
William, sir.	shakespearean
Lady Beatrice is angry with you.	modern
And do still, by these pickers and stealers.	shakespearean
My curses on her!	shakespearean
Until you get back, Nerissa and I will live like virgins and widows.	modern
But Antonio’s certainly ruined.	modern
We’ll give you an answer tomorrow.	modern
What, are you hurt, lieutenant?	shakespearean
Wrinkles forbid!	shakespearean
What, my dear Lady Disdain!	shakespearean
Orlando doth commend him to you both, And to that youth he calls his Rosalind He sends this bloody napkin.	shakespearean
I think he will stand very strong with us.	shakespearean
Our jailers will shrivel up with old age before they make us cry again.	modern
True, my lord.	shakespearean
I say she shall.—And first begin with her.	modern
Good hay, sweet hay, hath no fellow.	shakespearean
I think I can guess what you’re about to say.	modern
The gentleman that danced with her told her she is much wronged by you.	shakespearean
And, just in time, here comes the sweaty lord.	modern
Well, I cannot tell how my difficult life has weathered my face, but I will never let those difficulties subdue my courage.	modern
It was just like in real life, dark brown with silver whiskers in it.	modern
I beg you to tell me your name so I can use it in my prayers.	modern
I must needs after him, madam, with my letter.	shakespearean
Messala, today is my birthday—I was born on this very day.	modern
See, the snail already has its horns, which prevents nasty rumors from spreading about his wife’s infidelity.	modern
What do you mean, the seventh cause?	modern
But I have spoke With one that saw him die, who did report That very frankly he confessed his treasons, Implored your highness' pardon, and set forth A deep repentance.	shakespearean
His beard was grizzled, no?	shakespearean
Oh, Bottom, you’ve changed!	modern
Defend me, God, both when I’m asleep and when I’m awake.	modern
You are there followed by a faithful shepherd.	shakespearean
The kind that tells you that the Moor is having sex with your daughter right now.	modern
The dropsy drown this fool!	shakespearean
Is this the same Moor whom the senate considers so capable?	modern
What, is there such a place?	shakespearean
I didn’t call you.	modern
He cannot live, I hope, and must not die Till George be packed with post-horse up to heaven.	shakespearean
For shame!	modern
Master, you were so focused on the girl herself, I wonder if you missed the main point here.	modern
Know that I am Brutus!	modern
Oh Buckingham, now I’m going to test to see if you’re truly made of gold.	modern
My heart is sorry for your daughter’s death, But, on my honor, she was charged with nothing But what was true and very full of proof.	shakespearean
Yes, sweet Rosalind.	modern
No, pray thee, let it serve for table talk.	shakespearean
Then he offered it to him again, then he put it by again—but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his fingers off it.	shakespearean
Why, this is not a boon, 'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves, Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm, Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit To your own person.	shakespearean
But beshrew my jealousy!	shakespearean
Well, that’s what you get to do.	modern
I think that’s strange.	modern
Why look you pale?	shakespearean
And most chirurgeonly.	shakespearean
We do not mean the coursing snatchers only, But fear the main intendment of the Scot, Who hath been still a giddy neighbor to us.	shakespearean
What do you mean by that?	modern
Oh, ominous!	shakespearean
Sister, welcome.	shakespearean
It’s incredible—they didn’t say a word.	modern
Look how the floor of heaven Is thick inlaid with patens of bright gold.	shakespearean
I cannot live to hear the news from England.	shakespearean
Methinks you are too much of late i' th' frown.	shakespearean
Good sir, as a friend, I advise you to leave this place.	modern
I marry her!	shakespearean
I have come here to bury Caesar, not to praise him.	modern
The demon who seduced you could stride the world over with the proud gait of a lion, could return to hell and tell the devil’s legions, “I will never win another soul as easily as I won that Englishman’s.” How you have poisoned my faith in people!	modern
No, you unnatural hags,	shakespearean
But life itself, my wife, and the whole world aren’t more valuable to me than your life is.	modern
Cassio’s killed a young Venetian named Roderigo.	modern
I’ll do the service of a younger man In all your business and necessities.	shakespearean
Let’s not stay here with them.	modern
Well, do it, and be brief.	shakespearean
We have to go out and talk to them.	modern
Nine or ten times I had thought t' have yerked him here under the ribs.	shakespearean
I’m a poor man who’s been humbled by many misfortunes.	modern
What mean you, Caesar?	shakespearean
My noble lords and cousins all, good morrow.	shakespearean
And this is all because of our argument.	modern
But tell not me.	shakespearean
How “strangely”?	shakespearean
She seemed to be trying to control her emotions, which were overwhelming her.	modern
You say very true, scald knave, when God’s will is.	shakespearean
My father dead, my fortune lives for me.	shakespearean
Hers you are.	shakespearean
I came here with a fool’s head on my shoulders and now I’m leaving with two.—Goodbye, sweet lady.	modern
How’s the prince?	modern
Hark, come hither, Tyrrel.	shakespearean
Who ever knew the heavens menace so?	shakespearean
It doesn’t look that way to me.	modern
I’ve seen you fight and envied your skill.	modern
Thou wouldst make a good fool.	shakespearean
Which he’ll shove down our throats the way pigeons feed their young.	modern
If I had the goddess Juno’s power, I would make the strong-winged messenger, Mercury, pick you up and seat you beside Jove.	modern
He, he, ’tis he.	shakespearean
Twas you we laughed at.	shakespearean
Oh Portia, these are some of the worst words that ever stained a piece of paper.	modern
Do the deed that will make this island yours forever, and will make me, Caliban, your worshipful foot-licker.	modern
After a brief time—as he is a strong, brave man—	modern
But have I fall'n, or no?	shakespearean
Leave me for a bit.	modern
What, were you snarling all before I came, Ready to catch each other by the throat, And turn you all your hatred now on me?	shakespearean
And for the rest o' th' fleet, Which I dispersed, they all have met again And are upon the Mediterranean float, Bound sadly home for Naples, Supposing that they saw the king’s ship wracked And his great person perish.	shakespearean
If we take away Caesar’s support, he’ll have to come back down to earth; otherwise, he’ll fly too high and keep the rest of us in a state of fear and obedience.	modern
Hast thou affections?	shakespearean
Meet with the ambassadors.	modern
Prithee, be cheerful.	shakespearean
My ever-gentle cousin, welcome hither.	shakespearean
There is a kind of merry war betwixt Signor Benedick and her.	shakespearean
Brother, Duke, please have some food.	modern
The bark is ready and the wind at help, Th' associates tend, and everything is bent For England.	shakespearean
It harrows me with fear and wonder.	shakespearean
And you haven’t heard any news about her in your letters?	modern
How now, Roderigo!	shakespearean
tody of them so I can do what’s best out of concern for their honor and the safety of the kingdom.	modern
The Dauphin really wants it to be morning.	modern
What you would work me to, I have some aim.	shakespearean
O, what cause have I, Thine being but a moiety of my moan, To overgo thy woes and drown thy cries!	shakespearean
I am strong-framed.	shakespearean
Tell me your counsels.	shakespearean
where we quietly buried you, has opened up its heavy marble jaws to spit you out again.	modern
Didst thou not hear somebody?	shakespearean
Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus.	shakespearean
I’m awkward in my speech and I’m not a smooth talker.	modern
What promise, chuck?	shakespearean
Who else should be?	shakespearean
My mind is too great for that.	modern
If we lose, what do you plan to do?	modern
Are you going to hide and watch them having sex?	modern
Oh, dear God, don’t let me go mad!	modern
I would have thought her spirit had been invincible against all assaults of affection.	shakespearean
Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain, As in revenge, have sucked up from the sea Contagious fogs, which falling in the land Have every pelting river made so proud That they have overborne their continents.	shakespearean
Who’s that?	modern
Ride to Salisbury.	modern
And what’s your connection with the traitors who landed in our kingdom recently?	modern
Behold: it is the privilege of mine honors, My oath, and my profession.	shakespearean
Oh what a curse marriage is!	modern
You can judge for yourself what I mean.	modern
Tis fittest.	shakespearean
Alas, good Cassio!	shakespearean
I warrant you, sir, The white cold virgin snow upon my heart Abates the ardor of my liver.	shakespearean
O hell, what have we here?	shakespearean
Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.	shakespearean
Oh, wonder!	shakespearean
What dost thou say?	shakespearean
I am the worst person alive, and I know it the best.	modern
I think it is in Macedon where Alexander is porn.	shakespearean
I hope what she’s saying is well, sir!	modern
What a fine sight!	modern
What time is it?	modern
So, are you done?	modern
Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed.	shakespearean
That’s exactly what I’ll do, my love, and I hope you’ll do the same.	modern
I’m off to Venice to buy outfits for the wedding.	modern
I was told that you were violent, proud, and sullen.	modern
That head, my lord?	shakespearean
It’s the former Hero!	modern
A better instance, I say.	shakespearean
What we have to worry about is a full-scale invasion from Scotland—always an unreliable neighbor.	modern
And this cuff was but to knock at your ear and beseech list'ning.	shakespearean
I’ll stay no longer question.	shakespearean
Yet here, Laertes?	shakespearean
Go charge my goblins that they grind their joints With dry convulsions, shorten up their sinews With agèd cramps, and more pinch-spotted make them Than pard or cat o' mountain.	shakespearean
Oh earth, which soaks up this blood, revenge his death!	modern
I wouldn’t change it except to make you think of me, my darling queen.	modern
Shame of what, lady?	modern
Alas, I rather hate myself For hateful deeds committed by myself.	shakespearean
I knew you at the first You were a moveable.	shakespearean
Light, I say, light!	shakespearean
Huntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds.	shakespearean
But since you’re his scoundrel servant, I will.	modern
But if you see a wheel going uphill, latch on for the ride.	modern
Poor Tom, your cup is empty.	modern
Cheer up.	modern
Give me a living reason she’s disloyal.	shakespearean
Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?	shakespearean
And I hope he’s studying his music like he’s supposed to.	modern
That will be a good thing.	modern
But you, my noble lords, may name a time, and I’ll second it on the duke’s behalf, which I don’t think he’ll mind.	modern
Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor.	shakespearean
Is there any more, or is that it?	modern
Yes, very well, sir.	modern
He hath slept long.	shakespearean
Sick, oh, sick!	shakespearean
God help Claudio!	modern
What, shall I stab him as he sleeps?	shakespearean
The Moor himself is still at sea.	modern
I’m just saying that if you’re good and beautiful, your goodness should have nothing to do with your beauty.	modern
You were to blame, I must be plain with you, To part so slightly with your wife’s first gift, A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger And so riveted with faith unto your flesh.	shakespearean
Let everyone beware: I can shake off the tyranny that now oppresses me whenever I choose.	modern
How about the mustard without the beef.	modern
Alas Iago, What shall I do to win my lord again?	shakespearean
That’s very likely.	modern
The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch, But that the sea, mounting to th' welkin’s cheek, Dashes the fire out.	shakespearean
Me too, my lord.	modern
Well, Petruchio, this has put me in heart.	shakespearean
It’s been this way ever since the first government was organized.	modern
Go bring them all here; I give you power over them.	modern
By the way, if I were to compose an extra speech of twelve to sixteen lines and stick it into the play, you could learn it by heart for tomorrow, right?	modern
Lord Edmund didn’t speak to your master at home?	modern
Every glass of liquor is damned, and the devil’s the main ingredient!	modern
I marvel our mild husband Not met us on the way.	shakespearean
You must sing  This nothing’s more than matter.	shakespearean
Hey, hey!	modern
For every minute is expectancy Of more arrivance.	shakespearean
Since that respects and fortunes are his love, I shall not be his wife.	shakespearean
Be quiet, be quiet.	modern
I will discharge it in either your straw-color beard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain beard, or your French crown-color beard, your perfect yellow.	shakespearean
If thou account’st it shame, lay it on me, And therefore frolic!	shakespearean
If she find him not, To England send him or confine him where Your wisdom best shall think.	shakespearean
The night air is too raw and cold for us to stay outdoors.	modern
Well, I’m not sorry to hear that, because they have always been my enemies.	modern
I’d give up my life and take my son’s place in the mud on the ocean floor if I could see them alive in Naples.—When did you lose your daughter?	modern
If the matter of this paper be certain, you have mighty business in hand.	shakespearean
You rudely snuck out of bed.	modern
Really, I’m afraid you are.	modern
Your sister is the better soldier.	shakespearean
If by your art, my dearest father, you have Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.	shakespearean
He didn’t know how to stop it.	modern
But yet I’ll go in hate to feed upon The prodigal Christian.—Jessica, my girl, Look to my house.	shakespearean
That’s him.	modern
Then brook abridgment, and your eyes advance After your thoughts, straight back again to France.	shakespearean
But where is he?	modern
Speak, I charge you.	shakespearean
Lovely, most lovely Katherine, will you agree to teach a soldier the words that would recommend his love-suit to a gentle heart like yours?	modern
Woman, stop your frantic curses and false prophesies before we run out of patience and do something bad to you.	modern
Let’s lack no discipline, make no delay, For, lords, tomorrow is a busy day.	shakespearean
Sayest thou so?	shakespearean
The laws of Venice state that if a foreign resident directly or indirectly attempts to kill any citizen, the person he tried to kill will receive one half of the foreigner’s goods.	modern
But did you think the Prince would have served you thus?	shakespearean
Our fears in Banquo Stick deep, and in his royalty of nature Reigns that which would be feared.	shakespearean
This is all quite pleasant.	modern
I don’t have it with me.	modern
It’s my birthday.	modern
Tyrants themselves wept when they heard about it.	modern
I hate to say it, but it’s almost two and we won’t get there before suppertime.	modern
Whither are you going?	shakespearean
He will not say so.	shakespearean
Oh, it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb-shows and noise.	shakespearean
No, you entertain your suitors with mild and gentle conversation, quiet and pleasant.	modern
I won’t be satisfied until I get even with him, wife for wife.	modern
So take for life a fellow of pure and plain faithfulness.	modern
For no kind of traffic Would I admit.	shakespearean
I feel my stomach squeezing up against my heart.	modern
At least I don’t have a horse for my mistress—or a saying so beside the point.	modern
Deny me this, And an eternal curse fall on you!	shakespearean
Or rather, do what you feel like doing.	modern
You say he’s friendly with Caesar, healthy, and free.	modern
I tell you what you shall do.	shakespearean
Here’s why: it’d be better for the enemy to come after us.	modern
If she will stir hither, I shall seem to notify unto her.	shakespearean
Before my body I throw my warlike shield.	shakespearean
The gallants desire it.	shakespearean
Pretty soul!	shakespearean
First, there is the Neapolitan prince.	shakespearean
I must be one of these silent so-called wise men Gratiano’s talking about, because he never lets me get a word in.	modern
Pronounce them—it is just as nice to say.	modern
Sounds good to us.	modern
Good madam, patience.	shakespearean
Here, master.	shakespearean
Come on, be a man.	modern
Sink Rome!	shakespearean
Bassanio told him he’d try to hurry back.	modern
Till then sit still, my soul.	shakespearean
She’s an excellent, sweet woman, and there’s no doubt that she is virtuous.	modern
Me too.	modern
You need to.	modern
These are unnatural events.	modern
She loved me for the dangers I had passed, And I loved her that she did pity them.	shakespearean
I am dying, Egypt, dying.	shakespearean
Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.	shakespearean
Here on her breast there’s a little bloody mark.	modern
Kent, if you want to stay alive, stop talking.	modern
shifts, friends, to Southampton.	modern
Take some men and horses and go to her.	modern
Will you yield and this avoid Or, guilty in defense, be thus destroyed?	shakespearean
Damn it!	modern
That’s what you get for marrying Christian husbands.	modern
Then away she started To deal with grief alone.	shakespearean
Nay then, I will not.	shakespearean
She can’t deny it.	modern
But I pray you, tell me, is my boy, God rest his soul, alive or dead?	shakespearean
Yes, my lord.	modern
Even here Do we shake hands.	shakespearean
Night is approaching.	modern
And so, my words and thoughts will be at odds.	modern
Sola, sola!	shakespearean
And pity to the general wrong of Rome— As fire drives out fire, so pity pity— Hath done this deed on Caesar.	shakespearean
I won’t stand for it.	modern
Tell him I am ready to lay my crown at his feet and kneel before him.	modern
Now in faith, Gratiano, You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief.	shakespearean
A man named Iago, the general’s ensign.	modern
I’ll be with thee betimes.	shakespearean
Have you written that letter to my sister yet?	modern
All three of them are crazy with despair.	modern
My good King, surprise the English and let them know what kind of kingdom you rule over.	modern
And I know not what’s spent in the search.	shakespearean
You are a fool.—You, niece, provide yourself.	shakespearean
You’re hitting close to home there.	modern
After that, nothing can hurt him further—not weapons, poison, rebellion, invasion, or anything else.	modern
Did you say Caesar fainted?	modern
I swear—      By nothing, for this is no oath.	shakespearean
Thy shape invisible retain thou still.	shakespearean
Yes, even if I die an hour later.	modern

Who sent you hither?	shakespearean
Listen to Antony.	modern
Nay, I hope.	shakespearean
What tell’st thou me of robbing?	shakespearean
Two deep enemies, Foes to my rest, and my sweet sleep’s disturbers, Are they that I would have thee deal upon.	shakespearean
And leave us, Publius, in case the people storming us should harm you.	modern
But he that will believe all that they say shall never be saved by half that they do.	shakespearean
Three thousand ducats.	modern
Therefore I pray you lead me to the caskets To try my fortune.	shakespearean
You’ve pierced me through the heart with your cruelty, and yet you, the murderer, look as bright and clear as a star in the sky.	modern
Listen, Hortensio.	modern
Very many, men and women too.	shakespearean
I’ll use Albany’s power and authority for now to win the war, but afterward one of the sisters—whichever one wants to—can get rid of him.	modern
Aye, sir.	shakespearean
Yes, sir.	modern
Leave, gentle wax, and, manners, blame us not.	shakespearean
See this dispatched with all the haste thou canst: Anon I’ll give thee more instructions.	shakespearean
Lead’s too crass to hold her.	modern
He wore his beaver up.	shakespearean
My lord, I have.	shakespearean
If it were me, I’d be very upset too.	modern
Thanks, good my countryman.	shakespearean
By the light of heaven, no, I would not!	modern
That her father’s brother wants to be her husband?	modern
What are you doing, Caesar?	modern
He was so sharp when he was in school.	modern
We’re sitting ducks for the French, if they only knew it, for there is no one guarding it but boys.	modern
See, doth he breathe?	shakespearean
Ay, and wisely.	shakespearean
It’s a reason for suspicion, even though it’s just a dream.	modern
Make me not offended In your distrust.	shakespearean
I heard the news, my lord.	modern
A noble ship of Venice Hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance On most part of their fleet.	shakespearean
Let him run far away.	modern

Here’s our chief guest.	shakespearean
It seems to me That yet we sleep, we dream.	shakespearean
In happy time.	shakespearean
Those that will hear me speak, let 'em stay here.	shakespearean
When I could see, I didn’t always see clearly.	modern
What doth she say, my lord of Buckingham?	shakespearean
A privilege never to see me more.	shakespearean
Should I get your nightgown?	modern
Stop, for God’s sake!	modern
But, alas, Caesar must bleed for it.	shakespearean
The clock’s just striking twelve.	modern
Get me a taper in my study, Lucius.	shakespearean
I’ve said what I have to say.	modern
We know what belongs to a watch.	shakespearean
You sound like a pack of wolves howling at the moon.	modern
Am I not stayed for?	shakespearean
I denied you not.	shakespearean
Cool it with a baboon’s blood, Then the charm is firm and good.	shakespearean
And so say I.	shakespearean
And Trinculo is reeling ripe.	shakespearean
Who can prosecute me for it?	modern
Tis but a peevish boy—yet he talks well— But what care I for words?	shakespearean
Let us not burden our remembrances with A heaviness that’s gone.	shakespearean
No, there it is again.	modern
You must not go without having a drink first.	modern
Order supplies for your trip and choose your traveling companions.	modern
Oh Margaret, Margaret, your heavy curse has now landed on poor Hastings’s miserable head!	modern
But do you mean what you’re saying?	modern
Call in the messengers.	shakespearean
Or do you want me to criticize her like I do all women?	modern
Kingly power seems most like God’s power when the king mixes mercy with justice.	modern
And this may help to thicken other proofs That do demonstrate thinly.	shakespearean

Hail to your lordship.	shakespearean
She has deceived her father, and may thee.	shakespearean

Oh, wretched villain!	shakespearean
Oh God, remember to hear her prayer for them, just as for us!	modern
Now summon up the image of stealthy murmurs and engulfing darkness filling the wide vessel of the universe.	modern

I’ll moan very believably.—Name the other actors.—But I’m really in the mood to play a tyrant.	modern
Is  Would your Mightiness care to wash his hands?	modern
Ah, poor heart, he is so shaked of a burning quotidian tertian that it is most lamentable to behold.	shakespearean
Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field You do me mischief.	shakespearean
But Macbeth is.	shakespearean
He is too disputable for my company.	shakespearean
You’re mistaken about all that.	modern
I’d try it, if I could cry “hem” and have him.	modern
Morning’s here.	modern
Then I would you were so honest a man.	shakespearean
You have good judgment in horsemanship.	shakespearean
It would be better for Macbeth to rule than someone like me.	modern
About the table, sir, dinner will be served on it.	modern
Now all the plagues that in the pendulous air Hang fated o'er men’s faults light on thy daughters!	shakespearean
Ay, marry, is ’t.	shakespearean
By my sword, Beatrice, you love me.	modern
And will she yet abase her eyes on me, That cropped the golden prime of this sweet prince And made her widow to a woeful bed?	shakespearean
And I was right, because where’s your husband now?	modern
I understand moreover, upon the Rialto, he hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and other ventures he hath squandered abroad.	shakespearean
Or Charles or something weaker masters thee.	shakespearean
I am glad to see you well.— Horatio?	shakespearean
No, it is Casca, one incorporate To our attempts.	shakespearean
I will not hear thee speak.	shakespearean
Come on, you keep getting paler.	modern
Yes, with Cassio.	modern
It’s obvious to everyone that you’ve tricked her, drugged her, or kidnapped her.	modern
Love wrought these miracles.	shakespearean
No, just to the gates of hell, where the devil will meet me, with the horns on his head like a cuckold, and say, “Go up to heaven, Beatrice.	modern
Help me, my women!	shakespearean
Tell us about this wrestling.	modern
What of that?	shakespearean
Just looking at you makes me sick.	modern
Nay, certainly, I have heard the Ptolemies’ pyramises are very goodly things.	shakespearean
Please get him, my friend, I beg you.	modern
Is that a tradition?	modern
But, oh, vain boast!	shakespearean
Truly, lady, you have a merry heart.	modern
Yes, I’m sure he will—to stay with you.	modern
Isn’t it past two o'clock?	modern
It is a paltry cap, A custard-coffin, a bauble, a silken pie.	shakespearean
Here comes Sir Oliver.—Sir Oliver Martext, you are well met.	shakespearean
I don’t even know him.	modern
What night-rule now about this haunted grove?	shakespearean
Good cousin, good Meg, good Ursula, come help me get dressed.	modern
You would seem to know my stops.	shakespearean
You have among you many a purchased slave, Which—like your asses and your dogs and mules— You use in abject and in slavish parts Because you bought them.	shakespearean
Where did we leave off?	modern
He can act as brave as he wants, but I believe on a cold night like this he wishes he were neck-deep in the Thames, and I wish he were, too, and I with him, whatever the danger, so long as we were far away from here.	modern
I accept with thanks, Enobarbus.	modern
Trust not to rotten planks.	shakespearean
Women are made to bear, and so are you.	shakespearean
Now let thy friendly hand Put strength enough to ’t.	shakespearean
I have no hope That he’s undrowned.	shakespearean
Gentlemen, rise.	shakespearean
I leave him in your care—but oh, if only I were still in his favor I could arrange for better care for him.	modern
Macbeth doth come.	shakespearean
Then hurry up and tell me what you want.	modern
If I be waspish, best beware my sting.	shakespearean
Oh, with his sordid desertion, he sets the example for our own.	modern
What a long night is this!	shakespearean
Whatever happens tonight, don’t talk about it.	modern
But one fiend at a time, I’ll fight their legions o'er.	shakespearean
Play, trumpets!	modern
Is he married to Cleopatra?	modern
How much does he owe the Jew?	modern
I was an idiot to take it!	modern
Oh, you prophesied that the time would come when I would want your help in cursing that humpbacked spider, that hideous toad!	modern
Put on your nightgown, in case someone comes and sees that we’re awake.	modern
If you cut both their throats, then you are the absolute best.	modern
Then you are damned.	modern
While we were here guarding you as you slept, we heard a loud roar that sounded like bulls, or lions.	modern
For now, don’t try to persuade me anymore—I ask you as a friend.	modern
Tis not yet near day.	shakespearean
The graceful and renowned king is dead.	modern
One of us will stay and stand guard.	modern
Ay, mistress, and Petruchio is the master, That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue.	shakespearean
But these offers, Which serve not for his vantage, he shakes off, And so should you.	shakespearean
I do not know what “poetical” is.	shakespearean
I know where I will wear this dagger then.	shakespearean
What would you like, sir?	modern
You’re pale and trembling.	modern
Did you see anything?	modern
What could my sister’s letter to him say?	modern
For love I followed him.	shakespearean
Oh, Hamlet, how far she fell!	modern
He’ll kill me with tortures.	modern
How much more elder art thou than thy looks!	shakespearean
I have no words.	shakespearean
Have a good night!	modern
We don’t come here with the intention of making you happy.	modern
God Almighty, there must be some essential goodness even in evil, if men would only look for it.	modern
Yes, but the mustard is probably too hot.	modern
Show me, or at least prove it beyond the shadow of a doubt.	modern
You are all    Lord of lords!	modern
When she put it on my finger, she made me swear never to sell it, give it away, or lose it.	modern
Come, Let’s have one other gaudy night.	shakespearean
Go away now and in the morning meet me in the pit by the river in hell.	modern
But tell me, are you speaking seriously?	modern
Whore, your lover’s dead now, and you’ll be going to hell soon.	modern
I’ll talk with this good fellow.	shakespearean
Yes, you’re right.	modern
She’s a remarkable lady, if the rumors are to be believed.	modern
I also hope that we can be better strangers.	modern
O perjured woman, thou dost stone my heart, And mak’st me call what I intend to do A murder, which I thought a sacrifice!	shakespearean
I was, but I do find more pain in banishment Than death can yield me here by my abode.	shakespearean
Tear him, tear him!	shakespearean
There’s more to it than that.—Ganymede!	modern
And from now on, when you get hot with me, I’ll assume it’s your mother speaking and leave it at that.	modern
Please, I’m asking you, go ahead and get back to your state affairs.	modern
Wherefore did you so?	shakespearean
He’s the most stubborn dog that ever lived among humans.	modern
Pray thee, corporal, stay.	shakespearean
If it’s fighting he is after, some of us here should run and hide.	modern
We’ll do our duty to you, sir.	modern
I’m the ghost of your father, doomed for a certain period of time to walk the earth at night, while during the day I’m trapped in the fires of purgatory until I’ve done penance for my past sins.	modern
What, Lucius!	shakespearean
By heaven, I’ll have ’t.	shakespearean
You, fellow, step out of the crowd.	modern
I know thou canst not choose.	shakespearean
All right, Friar Francis, let’s keep this short.	modern
Let’s think ’t unsafe To come in to the cry without more help.	shakespearean
Our land forces have bravely stood firm.	modern
Yes, by God, that it is.	modern
How are you, Charmian?	modern
I’ll run away from you and hide in the bushes, and leave you to the mercy of wild animals.	modern
Only be patient till we have appeased The multitude, beside themselves with fear, And then we will deliver you the cause, Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him, Have thus proceeded.	shakespearean
The day will come that thou shalt wish for me To help thee curse that poisonous bunch-backed toad.	shakespearean
Bring me but to the very brim of it, And I’ll repair the misery thou dost bear With something rich about me.	shakespearean
Sweet Hero, now thy image doth appear In the rare semblance that I loved it first.	shakespearean
Ha, it may be I go under that title because I am merry.	shakespearean
You lie.	modern
We are blessèd in the change.	shakespearean
Yes, I forgot—three months.	modern
A nice, soft pillow would be a more suitable place to lay that good white head than France’s hard, cold ground.	modern
That’s why your daughter and son-in-law are punishing me shamefully.	modern
No, someone has to give her away or the marriage isn’t legal.	modern
What, are you trying to make me crazy?	modern
The people have heard it already, and they’ve been told of his accusations.	modern
Your royal father is murdered.	modern
The poor rude world doesn’t have her equal.	modern
Those his goodly eyes, That o’er the files and musters of the war Have glowed like plated Mars, now bend, now turn The office and devotion of their view Upon a tawny front.	shakespearean
He who chooses me will get what he deserves.” That’s nicely put—because who’s going to cheat luck and get more than he deserves?	modern
Listen to me, Beatrice— Talking with a man outside her bedroom window!	modern
Do they seem religious?	modern
Fairy King, attend, and mark.	shakespearean
Come, firebrands, over here!	modern
Well, sir, we will not.	shakespearean
Asses are made for bearing, and so are you.	modern
The prayers of holy saints and wrongèd souls, Like high-reared bulwarks, stand before our faces.	shakespearean
Your servant shall do so.	shakespearean
It were, my lord, a hard condition for a maid to consign to.	shakespearean
Mark Antony, take Caesar’s body.	modern
Let me embrace with old Vincentio, And wander we to see thy honest son, Who will of thy arrival be full joyous.	shakespearean
When you fight against your country’s enemies, you will be paid for your efforts with your country’s wealth.	modern
He won’t have a chance.	modern
But soft, I pray you.	shakespearean
Venice has made Cassio governor here on Cyprus.	modern
They’re on the march.	modern
That’s the right answer—it shows your love.	modern
Thou know’st ’tis common.	shakespearean
Men, wives, and children stare, cry out, and run in the streets as though it were doomsday.	modern
Tell me, do I have your consent to kill them?	modern
What are you reading, teacher?	modern
I thank you very much on his behalf.	modern
So much was his pleasure should be proclaimed.	shakespearean
Well gentlemen, we’ve heard our assignment.	modern
He’s insane.	modern
I will requite your loves.	shakespearean
May ’t please your Majesty to give us leave Freely to render what we have in charge, Or shall we sparingly show you far off The Dauphin’s meaning and our embassy?	shakespearean
Were we before our armies, and to fight, I should do thus.	shakespearean
Will you be my husband, then?	modern
For the meat, sir, it shall be covered.	shakespearean
I have heard it over, And it is nothing, nothing in the world— Unless you can find sport in their intents, Extremely stretched and conned with cru 'l pain To do you service.	shakespearean
My mother.	shakespearean
But, room, fairy!	shakespearean
It was just removed from from the heart of—oh, she’s dead!	modern
Press near and second him.	shakespearean
We are sent To give thee from our royal master thanks, Only to herald thee into his sight, Not pay thee.	shakespearean
My lord, when I first saw him I thought he was your daughter’s brother.	modern
Is this the king we sent to for his ransom?	shakespearean
Good morrow, Catesby.— You may jest on, but, by the Holy Rood, I do not like these several councils, I.	shakespearean
Some to Ligarius'.	shakespearean
My other self, my council’s consistory, My oracle, my prophet, my dear cousin, I, as a child, will go by thy direction Toward Ludlow then, for we’ll not stay behind.	shakespearean
Caesar’s better qualities exist in Brutus, and we will crown him.	modern
In thunder, lightning, or in rain?	shakespearean
Take heed, sirrah—the whip.	shakespearean
There’s comfort yet; they are assailable.	shakespearean
For I am he am born to tame you, Kate, And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate Conformable as other household Kates.	shakespearean
Your eyes look threatening.	modern
Oh, correct it completely.	modern
We wish your peace.	shakespearean
More than pertains to feats of broils and battle, And therefore little shall I grace my cause In speaking for myself.	shakespearean
If I can tame him, I’ll charge as much as I can get for him.	modern
Be’st thou sad or merry, The violence of either thee becomes, So does it no man else.—Mett’st thou my posts?	shakespearean
What’s your name?	modern
Tis yours, and we, Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest, shall Hang in what place you please.	shakespearean
The king’s a dear boy with a heart of gold, he’s a lively lad, a wag, born of fine parents, good with his fists.	modern
Oh, that’s with worry.	modern
She herself is as valuable as any dowry could ever be.	modern
Is ’t so, indeed.	shakespearean
How dare you try to be my friend when you refuse to fight my enemy.	modern
That is enough to satisfy the senate.	shakespearean
And, for his passage, The soldiers' music and the rites of war Speak loudly for him.	shakespearean
Away, slight man!	shakespearean
The time ’twixt six and now Must by us both be spent most preciously.	shakespearean
Will you be married, motley?	shakespearean
Clubs cannot part them.	shakespearean
Thank you, sir.	modern
To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.	shakespearean
O, yet defend me, friends.	shakespearean
What’s your will?	shakespearean
And in her eyes I see a fire that would seem to burn away the lies the princes have told about her chastity.	modern
For this present, I would not, so with love I might entreat you, Be any further moved.	shakespearean
He’s the only worthy man in Italy, aside from my dear Claudio.	modern
That’s more to me than my wetting.	shakespearean
Go on before.	shakespearean
Now, for my life, Hortensio fears his widow.	shakespearean
How many months do you want?	modern
Now sir, be judge yourself, Whether I in any just term am affined To love the Moor.	shakespearean
In that case I’m afraid you’re damned by both your father and your mother.	modern
Pisa, renownèd for grave citizens, Gave me my being and my father first, A merchant of great traffic through the world, Vincentio, come of the Bentivolii.	shakespearean
Caesar, I shall.	shakespearean
Please, will you take his arm?	modern
Read your history!	modern
The fiend gives the more friendly counsel.	shakespearean
Most noble man, will you die?	modern
Mark Antony In Egypt sits at dinner, and will make No wars without doors.	shakespearean
Now, I’ll swear to the opposite—that the pancakes were rotten, and the mustard was fine—but even so, the knight wasn’t lying.	modern
But are you sure that Benedick loves Beatrice that much?	modern
I pray the gods she may, with all my heart!	shakespearean
I willingly accept your offer and put my future in your hands.	modern
Now I see that all three of them have gotten together to play this cruel trick on me.	modern
So, may the gods protect you and change the hearts of the Romans so that they turn and give you their support.	modern
Here’s a sick man who wants to speak with you.	modern
Who’d waste his time talking to such a stupid bird?	modern
Gentlemen all, I do suspect this trash To be a party in this injury.— Patience awhile, good Cassio.—Come, come, Lend me a light.	shakespearean
Know’st thou Fluellen?	shakespearean
Do you have to harp on my inadequacy?	modern
A lover would have to be weepier, of course.	modern
I recognize something about that voice.	modern
I don’t understand why she’s not locked up.	modern
In my chamber window lies a book.	shakespearean
Edmund and I have talked, and it makes more sense for him to marry me than Goneril.	modern
She gave up her life with your name still within her.	modern
In the corrupted currents of this world Offense’s gilded hand may shove by justice, And oft ’tis seen the wicked prize itself Buys out the law.	shakespearean
Learn it, learn it, marquess.	shakespearean
Absolutely, people should be what they appear to be.	modern
And why not the swift foot of time?	shakespearean
For many miles about There’s scarce a bush.	shakespearean
Give him no breath, but now Make boot of his distraction.	shakespearean
The shame itself doth speak For instant remedy.	shakespearean
You, mistress, all this coil is long of you.	shakespearean
Dost thou hear, my honest friend?	shakespearean
Prescribe not us our duty.	shakespearean
That’s Enobarbus?	modern
I hope this passionate humor of mine will change.	shakespearean
I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me.	shakespearean
If you will patiently dance in our round And see our moonlight revels, go with us.	shakespearean
But was not this nigh shore?	shakespearean
Rebels it at these years?	shakespearean
Or if you haven’t broken away from human company, as my feelings now lead me to do, you haven’t loved.	modern
When we’re born, we cry because we’ve arrived on the stage of life, like all the other fools.	modern
He leaps from the ground as if his insides were light as hairs.	modern
And stand indebted, over and above, In love and service to you evermore.	shakespearean
I' th' mire.	shakespearean
What think you on ’t?	shakespearean
To be once in doubt Is to be resolved.	shakespearean
Please, one of you go ask that man over there if we can buy some food off him.	modern
Apollo plays, And twenty cagèd nightingales do sing: Or wilt thou sleep?	shakespearean
There’s very little about her that’s gloomy, my lord.	modern
Call you?	shakespearean
I rather choose To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you, Than I will wrong such honorable men.	shakespearean
I’ll get him to come here, and you can ask him yourself.	modern
How does my old acquaintance of this isle?— Honey, you shall be well desired in Cyprus, I have found great love amongst them.	shakespearean
Good morning, Catesby.	modern
Come on, Casca, you and I will go see Brutus at his house before sunrise.	modern
No, don’t.	modern
At least I’m sure it may be so in Denmark.	shakespearean
My liege, this was my glove.	modern
What is ’t, my lord?	shakespearean
But this is trifling, And all the more it seeks to hide itself The bigger bulk it shows.	shakespearean
Sometimes from her eyes I did receive fair speechless messages.	shakespearean
Come with me now, and help me out.	modern
Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy.	shakespearean
Save thee, Curan.	shakespearean
I do not like her name.	shakespearean
I saw it with my own eyes.	modern
Call out my household servants.	modern
The king has killed his heart.	shakespearean
Do you really mean to go after this wildcat?	modern
Uncle, please give me your dagger.	modern
My lord of Orléans, and my Lord High Constable, you talk of horse and armor?	shakespearean
As far as I know, he’s not even dead.	modern
Ah, this place is too cold to be hell.	modern
Gentlemen, let’s go make sure Cassio’s wounds are properly dressed.—Come on, ma'am, you can tell us another story.	modern
I watched him very closely.	modern
Tell him to gather together the greatest army he can muster in a hurry and meet me right away at Salisbury.	modern
I did, my lord.	shakespearean
In which array, brave soldier, doth he lie, Larding the plain, and by his bloody side, Yoke-fellow to his honor-owing wounds, The noble earl of Suffolk also lies.	shakespearean
Cleopatra Hath nodded him to her.	shakespearean
You must not deny me.	shakespearean
I don’t completely distrust you.	modern
Carry him to my best room—gently, so he doesn’t wake—and hang all my erotic paintings around him.	modern
Against my will, I’ve been told to bring you in to dinner.” There’s a double meaning in that.	modern
The gods reward your kindness!	shakespearean
O Iago, the pity of it, Iago!	shakespearean
A friend?	modern
Return with her?	shakespearean
What news among the merchants?	shakespearean
Do you think I’d break my oath?	modern
It’s a friend of Antony’s.	modern
As willingly as e'er I came from school.	shakespearean
Assist, good friends.	shakespearean
I thank you.	shakespearean
From now on I will, cousin, and I’ll think of all kinds of games for us.	modern
Sir, I know you, and I trust you enough to share something very important with you.	modern
Has it come to this?	modern
Some innocents ’scape not the thunderbolt.	shakespearean
We shall obey, were she ten times our mother.	shakespearean
I shall devise something.	shakespearean
Now I have to go find some dewdrops and hang a pearl earring on every cowslip flower.	modern
I had myself notice of my brother’s purpose herein and have by underhand means labored to dissuade him from it; but he is resolute.	shakespearean
When did she send you?	modern
What not put upon His spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt Of our great quell?	shakespearean
I’ll not meddle with it.	shakespearean
Traverse, go, provide thy money.	shakespearean
Find out what this villainous Edgar is thinking, Edmund.	modern
But on the prettiest branches Or at the end of every sentence  I’ll write “Rosalinda,” Teaching everyone who can read that the essence of every spirit Is contained in this one woman.	modern
Do you hear?	shakespearean
If you thought that you’d be thinking too much.	modern
He was somewhere in the middle, between them . . .	modern
Is he standing or sitting?	modern
So fare you well till we shall meet again.	shakespearean
A holy day shall this be kept hereafter.	shakespearean
The ghost is definitely something to worry about.	modern
Here, sir, but trouble him not.	shakespearean
I cannot but remember such things were That were most precious to me.	shakespearean
My name’s Roderigo.	modern
It would be better if they were all on his father’s side, or that there were none at all on his father’s side.	modern
Duke, please go ahead with your state business.	modern
Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none.	shakespearean
Who intercepts my expedition?	shakespearean
Not us.	modern
I tried to play games with God, and he turned my fake prayer on my head, giving me for real what I’d asked for as a joke.	modern
Answer as I call you.—Nick Bottom, the weaver?	shakespearean
Welcome to Elsinore.	modern
We failed in half of our mission.	modern
The note is a big fat liar if it says I said so.	modern
Come let’s in all.	shakespearean
One knocks.	shakespearean
Bid her have good heart.	shakespearean
Then, God grant me too Thou mayst be damnèd for that wicked deed.	shakespearean
I will, madam.	modern
I want this to provoke confrontations, so I can give him a piece of my mind.	modern
Many will swoon when they do look on blood.	shakespearean
It’s a green-eyed monster that makes fun of the victims it devours.	modern
So be quiet.	modern
Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse Into the marketplace.	shakespearean
Stay, Jaques, stay.	shakespearean
Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge.	shakespearean
Though I am mad, I will not bite him.	shakespearean
Do I speak you fair?	shakespearean
It’s pointless to talk now.	modern
That’s Cassio’s voice.	modern
What you told me it haunts me like a nightmare—he’s got my handkerchief!	modern
For that he dares us to ’t.	shakespearean
News, my good lord, from Rome.	shakespearean
If he breaks the peace, he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling.	modern
I am the son of Marcus Cato!	modern
My Lord of Warwick, a most corrupt treason—God be praised for it!—has been discovered, as plain as any you’d hope to see on a summer’s day.	modern
Gower is a good captain, and is well versed and well read in the wars.	modern
Away, get thee away.	shakespearean
I must and will have Katherine for my wife.	modern
If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.	shakespearean
You are welcome to Elsinore.	shakespearean
What, have you lost your wits?	shakespearean
Why, what a king is this!	shakespearean
She is protectress of her honor too.	shakespearean
I thank you, sir.	shakespearean
Belike they had some notice of the people How I had moved them.	shakespearean
Here comes one o' the parings.	shakespearean
Do something about it, then.	modern
Looking toward England, we reminisced about the countless frightening experiences we’d had in the wars between the Yorks and the Lancasters.	modern
Well, I cannot tell.	shakespearean
What, no more ceremony?	shakespearean
I know you what you are, And like a sister am most loath to call Your faults as they are named.	shakespearean
Yes, just as great and just as recent.	modern
I will deliver you or else lie for you.	shakespearean
My lord, Hamlet’s going to his mother’s room.	modern
If ever I return to you again, I’ll bring you comfort.	shakespearean
Nature presently distilled Helen’s cheek, but not her heart, Cleopatra’s majesty, Atalanta’s better part, Sad Lucretia’s modesty.	shakespearean
Yes, my lord, if you give us permission.	modern
Follow me if you’re brave enough, and we’ll fight over Helena.	modern
I mean when I wore it at your daughter’s wedding.	modern
Oh Lord, who’s that crying?	modern
Aren’t you dead yet?	modern
Can you tell me if a man named Launcelot, who lives with him, is still there?	modern
Where lodges he?	shakespearean
I’ll write to him a very taunting letter, And thou shalt bear it.	shakespearean
I cannot tell.	shakespearean
I looked her in the face, and saw her led Between her brother and Mark Antony.	shakespearean
They’ll be married tomorrow, and I’ll invite the duke to the ceremony.	modern
Forgive me, darling Rosalind.	modern
Go and commend me to my brother Cassius.	shakespearean
That’s not an office for a friend, my lord.	shakespearean
Dispatch.—O love, That thou couldst see my wars today, and knew’st The royal occupation!	shakespearean
Your case is most unusual, though the Venetian law can’t stop you from proceeding.— Yes, so he says.	modern
Why couldn’t you be attended by my servants, or by Regan’s?	modern
Well be with you, gentlemen.	shakespearean
Is my ink and paper ready?	modern
And let him hold his fingers thus, and through that cranny shall Pyramus and Thisbe whisper.	shakespearean
Was it long or round?	modern
And for mine own part, I durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air.	shakespearean
And weren’t you the one who made him cheat on all of his other girlfriends, like Aegles, Ariadne, and Antiopa?	modern
Why came I hither but to that intent?	shakespearean
His soldiership Is twice the other twain.	shakespearean
The mercy that was alive in me a moment ago was smothered and killed by your own advice.	modern
Are you down in the dumps?	modern
Before the time be out?	shakespearean
A spirit, a spirit.	shakespearean
Come on.	modern
Lucillius and Titinius, bid the commanders Prepare to lodge their companies tonight.	shakespearean
Return with her?	shakespearean
And I’m expecting his reproach.	modern
Thou art the ruins of the noblest man That ever livèd in the tide of times.	shakespearean
Bring them before us.	shakespearean
But what’s this I see?	modern
I am boy to them all three, but all they three, though they would serve me, could not be man to me.	shakespearean
He can’t give his house away to his daughters, leaving himself without shelter.	modern
Tunis has never had such a beautiful queen.	modern
And though she be but little, she is fierce.	shakespearean
God knows I have done my best to argue for you, and made him angry at me for being so aggressive.	modern
And it is marvel he outdwells his hour, For lovers ever run before the clock.	shakespearean
These things, come thus to light, Smother her spirits up.	shakespearean
Promise me you’ll let me live, and I’ll confess the truth.	modern
You thought because he didn’t speak English like a native he couldn’t handle an English club.	modern
Faith, once or twice she heaved the name of “father” Pantingly forth as if it pressed her heart, Cried, “Sisters, sisters!	shakespearean
He says his name is Master Fer.	shakespearean
He’s dead and rotting in the dirt now.	modern
I pray you stand good father to me now.	shakespearean
Good madam, be not angry with the child.	shakespearean
What needed, then, that terrible dispatch of it into your pocket?	shakespearean
For that goes hard.	shakespearean
I was told that by one that knows him better than you.	shakespearean
Having once this juice, I’ll watch Titania when she is asleep And drop the liquor of it in her eyes.	shakespearean
This lanthorn doth the hornèd moon present.	shakespearean
Now, my Titania, wake you, my sweet queen.	shakespearean
I say, by sorcery he got this isle.	shakespearean
Then patiently hear my impatience.	shakespearean
It is needful that you frame the season for your own harvest.	shakespearean
As for us, you know we are Antony’s, and he is Caesar’s.	modern
We’ll never see each other again.	modern
Are all the cups and glasses in their places, the tablecloths laid out—everything in order?	modern
As you were on land.	modern
Lock the doors.	modern
Well, let’s hope you stay in that noble frame of mind.	modern
I know it pleaseth neither of us well.	shakespearean
To her that is not here, nor doth not hear.	shakespearean
One side will mock another—th' other too.	shakespearean
I do remember me, Henry the Sixth Did prophesy that Richmond should be king, When Richmond was a little peevish boy.	shakespearean
If you think about it correctly, Caesar has suffered a great wrong.	modern
And he’s rubbed himself with perfume.	modern
Buckingham himself has wandered away alone to who knows where.	modern
Just listen carefully while I tell you the amazing thing I saw, with these gentlemen as witnesses.	modern
So let it be with Caesar.	shakespearean
Oh, I am slain!	shakespearean
You bastard workhorse drudge!	modern
I speak but brotherly of him, but should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must blush and weep, and thou must look pale and wonder.	shakespearean
I order you, speak!	modern
But, O grief, Where hast thou led me?	shakespearean
Oh, well, stay till then!	modern
I’m going.	modern
The son ran away.	modern
Are you native of this place?	shakespearean
Good duke, come receive your daughter.	modern
But, go on.	modern
I use it all the time, since it’s all that I have.	modern
Heavens thank you for ’t!	shakespearean
Bloody constraint, for if you hide the crown Even in your hearts, there will he rake for it.	shakespearean
Lie with her—that’s fulsome.	shakespearean
Favorably, except that there wasn’t enough time for his Grace to hear, as I sensed he would have liked to, the details about how he is rightfully entitled to certain dukedoms in France, and to the throne of France in general, through clear lines of descent originating with his great-grandfather, Edward III.	modern
Is not your lord honorable without marriage?	shakespearean
I eat the air, like chameleons do.	modern
Treason has done his worst; nor steel nor poison, Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing Can touch him further.	shakespearean
For my part, I really don’t care.	modern
I’ll stop your mouth with a kiss.	modern
What shall we do, Enobarbus?	shakespearean
I bet my life some evil busybody, some meddling, lying jerk made up this rumor to get some position.	modern
Go with me to the duchess.	shakespearean
Oh, stop, fool.	modern
We are used to winning by standing on the earth and fighting toe to toe.	modern
O my dear niece, welcome thou art to me, Even daughter, welcome in no less degree.	shakespearean
And if she starts to drop off, I’ll rant and yell until I wake her up.	modern
Perdition catch my soul But I do love thee!	shakespearean
No, sir, she’s human.	modern
Bestow it at your pleasure, and believe Caesar’s no merchant, to make prize with you Of things that merchants sold.	shakespearean
You’ve got a sword, Gloucester.	modern
Why, if thou never wast at court, thou never saw’st good manners; if thou never saw’st good manners, then thy manners must be wicked, and wickedness is sin, and sin is damnation.	shakespearean
If things go well, bring the crowd to  I’m off.	modern
Now, by my mother’s son, and that’s me, it will be moon or star or whatever I want before I’ll travel to your father’s house.	modern
I probably am too young for you.	modern
I recently shared a bed with Cassio, and I couldn’t sleep because of a raging toothache.	modern
Who is this?	modern
Since she would love both of you, you two would be joined in that love.	modern
You must to Parthia.	shakespearean
Didn’t I meet up with your allies?	modern
The valiant never taste of death but once.	shakespearean
But mortals like you aren’t allowed to hear this description of the afterlife.	modern
Oh, I’m dead!	modern
If you mutiny against me, I’ll hang you from the next tree.	modern
Regard Titinius, And tell me what thou notest about the field.	shakespearean
Is he losing his mind?	modern
Like to the time o’ th’ year between the extremes Of hot and cold, he was nor sad nor merry.	shakespearean
It is gone.	shakespearean
How say you, Cassio?	shakespearean
I wish you and your scarred self had convinced me to wage our last battle on land.	modern
Niece, you are exceptionally perceptive.	modern
Let us seek out some desolate shade and there Weep our sad bosoms empty.	shakespearean
And have you mercy too!	shakespearean
Let it be written in eight and eight.	shakespearean
O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.	shakespearean
Well then, here’s more money for you.	modern
Spoke like a tall man that respects thy reputation.	shakespearean
Everything’s fine now.	modern
Let me have audience for a word or two.	shakespearean
I’ll leave you for now.	modern
Let me say first, madam, that he is well.	modern
Besides, he brings his destiny with him.	shakespearean
I’ve been crazed with so many miseries that my tongue has tired of lamenting and gone mute.	modern
They shall be married tomorrow, and I will bid the duke to the nuptial.	shakespearean
I never was nor never will be false.	shakespearean
No faithful subject ever rejoiced more at the discovery of most dangerous treason than I now rejoice that I was thwarted in a damnable undertaking.	modern
And when I get my reward, I’ll get out of here.	modern
Come, go we to the king.	shakespearean
That’s a wise idea.	modern
And till the tears that she hath shed for thee Like envious floods o'errun her lovely face, She was the fairest creature in the world— And yet she is inferior to none.	shakespearean
Therefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt.	shakespearean
You were a cold crumb on dead Julius Caesar’s plate when I met you.	modern
Peace, Grumio.	shakespearean
Sirs, take up the corpse.	modern
Oh, heavy ignorance!	shakespearean
After dinner Your hazard shall be made.	shakespearean
What, no more?	shakespearean
Young man, have you challenged Charles the Wrestler?	modern
Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire are my daughters.	shakespearean
That he was never trainèd up in arms.	shakespearean
That’s very sensible, but you missed my sense: I meant Hortensio is afraid of you.	modern
Then she was even more an angel, and you’re an even blacker devil!	modern
By my troth, I am sick.	shakespearean
I could not forget you, since I never saw you before in my life.	modern
As you all know, overconfidence is man’s greatest enemy.	modern
Oh, that my prayers could such affection move!	shakespearean
What, Grumio!	shakespearean
Get to it, be lustful, sleep around—I need soldiers for my army.	modern
O, forgive me my sins!	shakespearean
How are you doing, Charles?	modern
We haven’t even talked about who’ll be our torchbearers.	modern
This is some minx’s token, and I must take out the work?	shakespearean
What kind of work is this, Charmian?	modern
They are his dung, and he their beetle.	modern
My master’s a total Jew.	modern
If it will please Caesar To be so good to Caesar as to hear me, I shall beseech him to befriend himself.	shakespearean
Go, And with your speediest bring us what she says And how you find of her.	shakespearean
My king, they haven’t come back yet.	modern
Statilius waved the torchlight at us, but he hasn’t come back.	modern
For what good turn?	shakespearean
Nay, how will you do for a husband?	shakespearean
No more foolish talk.	modern
Caesar, I shall.	shakespearean
Yes, if Messala recommends me to you.	modern
There are many troubles brewing now that have yet to become full-fledged threats.	modern
Most welcome home!	shakespearean
The father and the master and the king didn’t order their subordinates' deaths when they ordered their services.	modern
This courtesy, forbid thee, shall the duke Instantly know, and of that letter too.	shakespearean
We used to sit together and sew one flower with our two needles, sewing it on one piece of cloth, sitting on the same cushion, singing one song in the same key, as if our hands, our sides, our voices and our minds were stuck together.	modern
Why then, thus it is: You must prepare your bosom for his knife.	shakespearean
Let thunder rumble!	modern
To hell with all worn-out horses, all crazy masters, and all bad roads.	modern
And we’ll wear out In a walled prison packs and sects of great ones That ebb and flow by the moon.	shakespearean
My lord, the enemy is past the marsh.	shakespearean
Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn Most useful for thy country.	shakespearean
Is everyone here?	modern
Ay, my lord.	shakespearean
He is all the mother’s, from the top to toe.	shakespearean
Whatever seems best to you.	modern
Will you to Scone?	shakespearean
I have an aunt who is a widow, who’s very rich and doesn’t have any children.	modern
That I love her, I feel.	shakespearean
No, my cousin, don’t wish that even one man who is now in England were here instead.	modern
He and his daughter are captured.	modern
Whip me, ye devils, From the possession of this heavenly sight!	shakespearean
I tell thee, Kate, ’twas burnt and dried away.	shakespearean
Well there, now you’ve said it.	modern
Well, I disagree.	modern
Say you so?	shakespearean
If you make the accusation convincingly, then my cunning won’t fail me.	modern
You have me, have you not?	shakespearean
Anyway, Jessica, go inside.	modern
Oh, Oh, Oh!	shakespearean
If I could say hello to the fifth one as happily as I’ll say goodbye to the first four, I’d be very happy he’s coming.	modern
Don’t you think so?	modern
If not, then I have no powers of observation.	modern
Oh, then you never loved as wholeheartedly as me.	modern
Give you good night.	shakespearean
What hope is that, may I ask?	modern
The heavens are being stingy with their light.	modern
What is the reason of this terrible summons?	shakespearean
Don’t waste any time.	modern
Good night, dear Captain Blunt.	modern
The king is mad.	shakespearean
Note if your lady strain his entertainment	shakespearean
Nay, hear them, Antony.	shakespearean
Well thought on.	shakespearean
I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor.	shakespearean
Fled to his house amazed.	shakespearean
Because, my good king, England is so poorly led, her scepter so foolishly borne by a vain, silly, shallow, impulsive youth, that she’s hardly a threat.	modern
Besides, they act as outward consciences and preachers to us all, a visible reminder that we should prepare ourselves for death.	modern
Wholeheartedly, good young man.	modern
I see this hath a little dashed your spirits.	shakespearean
The Duke’s in a meeting right now, and he’s sent for you too.	modern
No matter whither, so you come not here.	shakespearean
Search high and low, in every acre of the fields, and bring him here for me to see him.	modern
Let’s not argue here in front of both our armies, which ought to see nothing but love between us.	modern
Abominable villain!	shakespearean
They’ve recorded my crimes, and I would rather die than have to retell this shameful story.	modern
They are weary?	shakespearean
The ditty does remember my drowned father.	shakespearean
My charms I’ll break, their senses I’ll restore, And they shall be themselves.	shakespearean
Go in with me, and I will tell you my drift.	shakespearean
Is she as fiery a shrew as they say?	modern
Duke of Burgundy, if you want peace, the lack of which creates these misfortunes you describe, you must purchase it buy agreeing across-the-board to all our very just demands.	modern
None of these deranged rascals can shake me from my profession.	modern
We did, my lord, weeping and carrying on about the sobbing deer.	modern
Out of doubt he is transported.	shakespearean
Whence are you, sir?	shakespearean
Good my lord, give me thy favor still.	shakespearean
It was incredible!	modern
Provoke him that he may.	shakespearean
The spirits that know the future have told me this: “Don’t be afraid, Macbeth.	modern
Unreal mockery, hence!	shakespearean
I’ll not fail, if I live.	shakespearean
You’re a senator!	modern
It is my birthday.	shakespearean
They were planning to pull a mischievous trick on Ferdinand and Miranda, who have sworn not to sleep together till their wedding day.	modern
What is it, sir?	modern
Go ahead, do your worst.	modern
I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio.	shakespearean
I will read it.— How much unlike art thou to Portia!	shakespearean
Stop her!	modern
I do think Scotland is sinking under Macbeth’s oppression.	modern
What can be avoided Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods?	shakespearean
My sword is drawn.	shakespearean
Believe me, sir, It carries a brave form.	shakespearean
May a hot southwest wind blow on you and cover you with blisters all over.	modern
Hold on a moment, and listen to my advice.	modern
That’s as much as to say they are fools that marry.	shakespearean
Oh, conspiracy, are you ashamed to show your face even at night, when evil things are most free?	modern
Goodbye, sir.	modern
Get them in here.	modern
I find you quite gentle.	modern
That’s the next to do.	shakespearean
It’s our destiny, like death.	modern
Start the fire, good Curtis.	modern
If it’s work for a man, I’ll do it.	modern
But not, as I am, royal.	shakespearean
And what an excellent piece of work it is, too, madam lady!	modern
We’ll see them immediately.	modern
Yours, if we’re talking about  I’m leaving.	modern
Mark how the tyrant writes.	shakespearean
If he can manage to walk after our fight, I’ll never wrestle for money again.	modern
Treat me well.	modern
Twas the boy that stole your meat, and you’ll beat the post.	shakespearean
Casca, you’ll be the first to raise your hand.	modern
Then there’s hope a great man’s memory may outlive his life half a year.	shakespearean
I must be cruel only to be kind.	shakespearean
I will here shroud till the dregs of the storm be past.	shakespearean
How are you, my ladies?	modern
Dolabella, I shall remain your debtor.	shakespearean
My husband is often like this, and he has been since he was a child.	modern
With duty and desire we follow you.	shakespearean
What two crowns shall they be?	shakespearean
You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes.	shakespearean
Then why am I worried?	modern
These things to hear Would Desdemona seriously incline.	shakespearean
Right, as snow in harvest.	shakespearean
Life is a story told by an idiot, full of noise and emotional disturbance but devoid of meaning.	modern
She soon shall know of us, by some of ours, How honorable and how kindly we Determine for her, for Caesar cannot live To be ungentle.	shakespearean
Was ’t you he rescued?	shakespearean
Damned as thou art, thou hast enchanted her!	shakespearean
Exactly right.	modern
Indeed, my lord.	modern
I still insisted on knowing what the matter was, but you wouldn’t answer me, instead giving me an angry wave of your hand and telling me to leave you alone.	modern
Pish for thee, Iceland dog, Thou prick-eared cur of Iceland!	shakespearean
It’s his wife, Lady Grey, who got him to do this.	modern
Oh, what a world this is, when even what is beautiful in a man poisons him!	modern
Beat me?	shakespearean
O happy fair!	shakespearean
Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it, Though I alone do feel the injury.	shakespearean
Well, that’s really my job.	modern
Observe her, stand close.	shakespearean
Defend yourself!	modern
What mar you then, sir?	shakespearean
Marry her as you should have married her cousin, and I will let my revenge die.	modern
Ay, marry, was ’t, and he put it by thrice, every time gentler than other, and at every putting-by mine honest neighbors shouted.	shakespearean
But soft you, let me be.	shakespearean
Ay, ay.	shakespearean
Go fetch them hither.	shakespearean
Is this the noble Moor whom our full senate Call all in all sufficient?	shakespearean
He had none.	shakespearean
Hath she forsook so many noble matches, Her father and her country, and her friends, To be called “whore”?	shakespearean
I’m not moving an inch, pal.	modern
Right on cue, here’s the duke himself.	modern
Tut, I like it not.	shakespearean
You said it when you were furious.	modern
Tell me where you live.	modern
No rescue for me?	modern
I could do without another toast.	modern
He laughed at that and let me go.	modern
Fear will keep you safe.	modern
The Prince and Claudio are hurrying this way.	modern
Do you want me to lie, madam?	modern
She hath betrayed me and shall die the death.	shakespearean
And we did think it writ down in our duty To let you know of it.	shakespearean
His ceremonies laid by, in his nakedness he appears but a man, and though his affections are higher mounted than ours, yet when they stoop, they stoop with the like wing.	shakespearean
I thought thou hadst been resolute.	shakespearean
I saw them not.	shakespearean
And you.	shakespearean
Lord of lords!	shakespearean
Men, wives, and children stare, cry out, and run As it were doomsday.	shakespearean
Thy Edward he is dead, that killed my Edward, Thy other Edward dead, to quit my Edward; Young York, he is but boot, because both they Matched not the high perfection of my loss.	shakespearean
Woo’t thou fight well?	shakespearean
Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt— Whom leprosy o’ertake!—i’ th’ midst o’ th’ fight, When vantage like a pair of twins appeared Both as the same, or rather ours the elder, The breeze upon her, like a cow in June, Hoists sails and flies.	shakespearean
But i' faith, I should have been a woman by right.	shakespearean
Not me.	modern
How did you learn about this?	modern
Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported.	shakespearean
Methought I heard a voice cry, “Sleep no more!	shakespearean
Bid every noise be still.	shakespearean
What is it?	modern
If you had any sense of pity, or manners, you wouldn’t pretend to fight over me like this.	modern
Faith, like enough.	shakespearean
Get you to bed on th' instant, I will be returned Forthwith.	shakespearean
We would profane the other dead souls here if we sang the same requiem for her that we sang for them.	modern
Here comes my messenger.—How now, mad spirit?	shakespearean
Give him this deed, And let him sign it.	shakespearean
Good day and happiness to you, darling Rosalind.	modern
Such have but a shadow’s bliss.	shakespearean
His absence, sir, Lays blame upon his promise.	shakespearean
We have lost best half of our affair.	shakespearean
He’s a proper count, that Count Sugarplum, a sweet gentleman, for sure!	modern
The French are still fighting.	modern
No, I don’t want to send your soul to hell when I kill you.	modern
Why Doth it not then our eyelids sink?	shakespearean
Is ’t possible?	shakespearean
He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has, Or needs not us.	shakespearean
Or was it a blessing that we came here?	modern
What offense, sweet Beatrice?	shakespearean
Oh, no!	modern
Cousin, you didn’t used to be so thickheaded.	modern
It is my rival for Bianca.	modern
I hope I see him and hear him again soon.	modern
If I’m killed, it will only be the death of a man who was willing to be dead.	modern
It’s Cinna.	modern
If it’s me, there’s no time as good as this hour of Caesar’s death, and no weapon better than your swords, covered with the noblest blood in the world.	modern
Why, are we turning to men?	modern
Then he’ll be as calm and quiet as a dove waiting for her eggs to hatch.	modern
We’ll leave you, Brutus.	shakespearean
How are they escoted?	shakespearean
Gramercies, Tranio, well dost thou advise.	shakespearean
I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it.	shakespearean
Be you constant in the accusation, and my cunning shall not shame me.	shakespearean
Never to speak of this that you have seen.	shakespearean
Oh, will it never be day?	modern
The king is not to answer it.	shakespearean
The Marshal of France, Monsieur la Far.	shakespearean
What, aren’t you a Christian?	modern
God be wi' you.	shakespearean
I was contracted to them both.	shakespearean
Yes, my lord.	modern
I prithee, boy, run to the senate house.	shakespearean
If I agree to this, we may leave unharmed, with our shields undented.	modern
Let go of my hand.	modern
What’s the disease he means?	shakespearean
I’m not afraid of anyone but him.	modern
But thou'rt too much my friend, And I’ll not wish thee to her.	shakespearean
No jewel is like Rosalind.	shakespearean
How much low peasantry would then be gleaned From the true seed of honor!	shakespearean
But speak, Egeus.	shakespearean
Peter Quince— What sayest thou, bully Bottom?	shakespearean
I love thee well in that thou lik’st it not.	shakespearean
This ring, good sir—alas, it is a trifle.	shakespearean
Charles, I thank you for your loyalty to me, and you’ll see that I’ll reward you.	modern
What ring gave you my lord?	shakespearean
One Hero died defiled, but I do live, And surely as I live, I am a maid.	shakespearean
Who are the people who want to speak with me?	modern
Give me your answer, i' faith, do; and so clap hands and a bargain.	shakespearean
Don’t hurt me, please.	modern
Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?	shakespearean
Dost thou lie so low?	shakespearean
Shylock, albeit I neither lend nor borrow By taking nor by giving of excess, Yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend, I’ll break a custom.	shakespearean
I will dispatch it straight.	shakespearean
Tonight he boarded a treasure ship.	modern
I know the boy will well usurp the grace, Voice, gait, and action of a gentlewoman.	shakespearean
By my faith in love, I will, then.	modern
Drown yourself?	modern
No, thou proud dream, That play’st so subtly with a king’s repose.	shakespearean
Come down, behold no more.	shakespearean
Two great enemies, in fact, enemies to my peace of mind.	modern
He threw his eye aside— And mark what object did present itself: Under an old oak, whose boughs were mossed with age And high top bald with dry antiquity, A wretched, ragged man, o'ergrown with hair, Lay sleeping on his back.	shakespearean
It eats and sleeps and has the same five senses we do.	modern
I prithee name the time, but let it not Exceed three days.	shakespearean
Even though half of him is like a	modern
Then you are a better than the king.	shakespearean
If I weren’t a merciful man, I’d forget about your missing brother and punish you in his place.	modern
Do you know what Caesar intends to do with me?	modern
Last night she slept not, nor tonight she shall not.	shakespearean
But I say amen to everything she said.	modern
I’ve seen her do it.	modern
Approach, my Ariel, come.	shakespearean
Since you are a lying hypocrite, we must look after you.	modern
And I serve the fairy queen  To dew her orbs upon the green.	shakespearean
I wish I knew what is happening.	modern
Listen to me, for I have something to tell you.	modern
O excellent motion!	shakespearean
Keep me in temper.	shakespearean

The boy was the very staff of my age, my very prop.	shakespearean
Is it answered?	shakespearean
I wish you had told me you had a different father.	modern
Give me my fishing rod.	modern
Do you want to know who they are, then?	modern

No, lovely princess.	modern
How now?	shakespearean
I like to pretend you are, because then it’s almost like actually talking to her.	modern
Even if you had your eyes, you still might not recognize me.	modern
No, truly, for the truest poetry is the most feigning, and lovers are given to poetry, and what they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign.	shakespearean

Can you make no use of your discontent?	shakespearean
Benedick, Beatrice praised your wit the other day.	modern
Why, sir, he comes not.	shakespearean
Have you no more to say?	shakespearean
They should advance immediately, because I sense Octavius’s side is a bit fainthearted right now, and a sudden push would overthrow him.	modern
I will hear further reason for this.	shakespearean
How unlucky am I, having to apologize for doing the right thing!	modern
Othello isn’t any of those things.	modern

I will harp on it till my heartstrings break.	modern
Now please, tell Beatrice to come out.	modern
But you shall find the band that seems to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of their amity.	shakespearean

What, of death too, That rids our dogs of languish?	shakespearean
By the door.	modern
I still have room for six more wounds.	modern
Therefore your Grace may well say I have lost it.	shakespearean
Call him!	modern
Go ahead.	modern
I’ll go straight for that proverb with “To hell with the devil.” You are better at proverbs than I am by as much as “A fool shoots quickly and overshoots his mark.” You have overshot.	modern
Fare you well.	shakespearean
A mighty strength they carry.	shakespearean
Well, my good fellows, wait on me tonight.	modern
Let me come to her.	shakespearean
Let it go.	shakespearean
Me, poor man, my library Was dukedom large enough.	shakespearean
Hand in hand with fairy grace Will we sing and bless this place.	shakespearean
How low am I, thou painted maypole?	shakespearean
Our men have all broken ranks.	modern
You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life That should be in a Roman you do want, Or else you use not.	shakespearean

And so had I, but yet, for fashion sake, I thank you too for your society.	shakespearean
And here’s another, whose warped looks proclaim What store her heart is made on.	shakespearean
So the candle went out and now we’re all in the dark.	modern
He’d be quite a monster if his eyes were in his tail.	modern
Now, what kind of entertainment do we have to fill up the long three hours between dinner and bedtime?	modern
What’s this!	modern
Stay there and fortify it well against the French.	modern
O Pyramus, arise!	shakespearean
By this leek, I will most horribly revenge.	shakespearean

He’s dead.	modern
Bless you, fair lady!	modern
Turn the ship to the wind!	modern
Go with me, And in the breath of bitter words let’s smother My damnèd son that thy two sweet sons smothered.	shakespearean
You mean “paragon.” A  The duke’s leaving the temple.	modern
The only thing different about me is my clothes.	modern
Give me details.	modern
Well demanded, wench.	shakespearean
You’ll have your answer soon.	modern
Sir, he left his belongings and treasure.	modern
Not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew, Thou makest thy knife keen.	shakespearean
I will seek him, sir, presently, convey the business as I shall find means, and acquaint you withal.	shakespearean
Stand close together, in case someone loyal to Caesar tries to— Don’t talk about standing together.—Publius, cheer up.	modern

But now the duke of Buckingham and I Are come from visiting his majesty.	shakespearean
There will she hide her To listen our propose.	shakespearean
I’ll entreat for thee.	shakespearean
Everything is gloomy, dark, and dreadful.	modern
He was an admirable king.	modern
I hope you’re an expert in your field.	modern
Stay away for now, and good night, my sweet friend.	modern

Some god direct my judgment!	shakespearean

Forgot you!	shakespearean
He shall live a man forbid.	shakespearean
Richard, the duke of Gloucester, hates you.	modern
Here is some money for you to kill me immediately.	modern
This blows my heart.	shakespearean
I am Grumio’s pledge.	shakespearean
For, meeting her of late behind the wood, Seeking sweet favors from this hateful fool, I did upbraid her and fall out with her.	shakespearean
But now it’s stopped.	modern
Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both.	shakespearean
Who does time amble for?	modern
Would they were basilisks to strike thee dead.	shakespearean
I came hither to tell you; and, circumstances shortened, for she has been too long a-talking of, the lady is disloyal.	shakespearean
What are you doing, old man?	modern
He has killed me, mother.	shakespearean
I know where I’ll wear this dagger, then.	modern
On each side her Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids, With divers-colored fans, whose wind did seem To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool, And what they undid did.	shakespearean
And if anything important happens, find me and let me know.	modern
Let the trumpet sound.	shakespearean
Saw you the weird sisters?	shakespearean
Oh, Kent, what could I ever do to become as good as you are?	modern
Hear you, sir?	shakespearean
That upsets me much more than getting wet.	modern
Master, you looked so longly on the maid, Perhaps you marked not what’s the pith of all.	shakespearean
By this token, you’ll be admitted to their cell.	modern
He did receive his letters and is coming.	shakespearean
So I won’t choose what many men desire, because I won’t jump on the bandwagon and include myself with the whole crude population.	modern
Here’s yet some liquor left.	shakespearean
If I know my own thoughts and desires, and I’m not dreaming or crazy—which I’m sure I’m not—then, dear uncle, I’ve never had so much as a half-formed thought that would have offended you.	modern
Isn’t it strange?	modern
Shall I strike now?	shakespearean
She lives.	shakespearean
All the rumors have been confirmed.	modern
Cram your good news into my ears.	modern
Yes, I will.	modern
So the gods preserve thee!	shakespearean
Where is the Master, Boatswain?	shakespearean
Dispatch, I say, and find the forester.	shakespearean
I’ll warrant him for drowning though the ship were no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an unstanched wench.	shakespearean
The little strength that I have, I would it were with you.	shakespearean
Tell me, is it missing?	modern
Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.	shakespearean
Laugh to scorn The power of man, for none of woman born Shall harm Macbeth.	shakespearean
I’m afraid that may be the case, madam.	modern

Rome has lost the ability to raise noble men!	modern
My niece, you are welcome here as if you were my own daughter.	modern
Pardon, sweet father.	shakespearean

Away, and let me die.	shakespearean
The lady has died because of the false accusations of me and my master.	modern
I am paid for ’t now.	shakespearean
How are you feeling now?	modern
Then is there mirth in heaven When earthly things, made even, Atone together.	shakespearean
I hope to God I’m proven wrong!	modern
Appear before me now quickly— No talking.	modern
Either be calm and polite or I’ll drown you out with the music of war.	modern
I am ashamed that women are so foolish as to declare war when they should plead on their knees for peace, that they seek authority, supremacy, and power when they are under an obligation to serve, love, and obey.	modern
Before the eyes of both our armies here, Which should perceive nothing but love from us, Let us not wrangle.	shakespearean
Let that suffice you.	shakespearean
Hold off burying her until I’ve caught her in my arms once more.	modern
Roderigo’s been killed?	modern
He’s full of wise sayings and up-to-the-minute anecdotes: that’s the way he plays his part.	modern
Yes, sir, but not when I’m enraged.	modern
The Queen will be treated fairly if she gives me up?	modern
I said you had a fine wit.	modern
Mark me.	shakespearean
Not a second more.	modern
Yes, sir, I have.	modern
They have in England A coin that bears the figure of an angel Stamped in gold, but that’s insculped upon.	shakespearean

What art thou that dost grumble there i' th' straw?	shakespearean
Let this anger sharpen your sword.	modern
He doesn’t long for the dawn as we do.	modern
What, you’re leaving it with Lysander?	modern
The players cannot keep counsel.	shakespearean
For the poor wren, The most diminutive of birds, will fight, Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.	shakespearean
Tom, away!	shakespearean
Near and on speedy foot.	shakespearean
In Caesar’s fleet Are those that often have ’gainst Pompey fought.	shakespearean
Oh, poor shepherd!	modern
Is it really possible that you could like her right after meeting her?	modern
Lay her a-hold, a-hold!	shakespearean
Does it mean being truthful?	modern
Look who’s coming: a young man and an old man, having a serious talk.	modern
But she is wise.	modern
My lord, what I say may be a little confused, since I’m half asleep and half awake.	modern
It was not Caesar’s bravery that conquered Antony but Antony’s that has triumphed over himself.	modern
To do this is within the compass of man’s wit, and therefore I will attempt the doing it.	shakespearean
I cannot fly, But, bearlike, I must fight the course.	shakespearean
He hath.	shakespearean
This is like if I asked you to wear your gloves when it’s cold outside, or eat nutritious food, or do something that’s good for you.	modern
She was too fond of her most filthy bargain.	shakespearean
The table is full on both sides.	modern
Gentle madam, no.	shakespearean
You’re still here?	modern
You have stayed me in a happy hour.	shakespearean
Come in, tailor.	shakespearean
I’ll send goblins out at night to work their nasty deeds on you.	modern
Why are you drawn?	shakespearean
This lion is a very fox, for his valor.	shakespearean
Come hither, sir.	shakespearean
Well, be it so.	shakespearean
Hunt them down.	modern
You may, Mark Antony.	modern
Where are you going?	modern
My lord, I won’t miss it.	modern
O Clitus!	shakespearean
He shall kill two of us, and men indeed, But that’s no matter.	shakespearean
I’m leaving now.	modern
She’ll have to have it.	modern
You rub the sore When you should bring the plaster.	shakespearean
O, would to God that the inclusive verge Of golden metal that must round my brow Were red-hot steel to sear me to the brains!	shakespearean
How appears the fight?	shakespearean
Don’t play any nasty tricks on me.	modern
Don’t shed even one tear.	modern
I’ll have her, but I will not keep her long.	shakespearean
From this time Such I account thy love.	shakespearean
What did he say?	modern
I stand dishonored, that have gone about To link my dear friend to a common stale.	shakespearean
If her breath were as terrible as her terminations, there were no living near her; she would infect to the north star.	shakespearean
Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damnèd Dane, Drink off this potion.	shakespearean
A sovereign shame so elbows him.	shakespearean
But who comes here?	shakespearean
I’m so amazed by this, I don’t know what to say.	modern
Then by all means never let her walk in public.	modern
There’s little or nothing of that.	modern
There is a particular lord who will watch you perform tonight.	modern
Why, how now, daughter Katherine?	shakespearean
You’re lying.	modern
Out of the frying pan and into the fire—from a tyrant duke to a tyrant brother!	modern
He’s no standard.	shakespearean
Stop, even if only to kill me.	modern
Why sinks that cauldron?	shakespearean
Nor anyone.	shakespearean
Brother, you’ve made a mistake.	modern
Yet I have known those which have walked in their sleep who have died holily in their beds.	shakespearean
Then did they imitate that which I composed to my courser, for my horse is my mistress.	shakespearean
Let’s make us med'cines of our great revenge, To cure this deadly grief.	shakespearean
But ’tis a spirit.	shakespearean
Tyrant, show your face!	modern
I have an exposition of sleep come upon me.	shakespearean
Fie, fie, ’tis lewd and filthy!	shakespearean
But for your words, they rob the Hybla bees And leave them honeyless.	shakespearean
And therefore haste away, For we must measure twenty miles today.	shakespearean
I have to tell you, I thought you were a much kinder person than this.	modern
Hamlet, thou art slain.	shakespearean
Your fortunes are alike.	shakespearean
Go wherever you want.	modern
You’re right, actually.	modern
Come, no matter vor your foins.	shakespearean
Yes, very bad.	modern
Tell us, Othello.	modern
I’ll meet it if it’s the last thing I do.	modern
Yes, that’s it!	modern
Ay, truly, for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness.	shakespearean
How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony’s nephew?	shakespearean
The Hero that died!	modern
Naught’s had, all’s spent, Where our desire is got without content.	shakespearean
He hath been in unusual pleasure, and Sent forth great largess to your offices.	shakespearean
I am loath to tell you what I would you knew.	shakespearean
I wouldn’t marry her, even if she were as blessed as paradise.	modern
Now you have only the memory of what you were, which tortures you when you consider what you’ve become.	modern
But is he often thus?	shakespearean
Some friendship will it lend you 'gainst the tempest.	shakespearean
Cleopatra recognizes your greatness and accepts your authority.	modern
But how can you say that, when the king himself says you’re the heir to the Danish throne?	modern
Also King Lewis the Tenth, Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet, Could not keep quiet in his conscience, Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother, Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare, Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine, By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great Was reunited to the crown of France.	shakespearean
Call that servant back.	modern
Will you be having dinner with her tonight?	modern
I wrote a verse to this tune, though it’s not very imaginative.	modern
He pretended that everything was fine until the moment they were exchanging vows, and then—with public accusation, blatant slander, pure hatred—Oh God, if only I were a man!	modern
Come on.	modern
Give me the cups.	shakespearean
These be good humors.	shakespearean
In a way, I mean.	modern
Only Adam, Rafe, and Gregory were ready.	modern
You shall never take her without her answer unless you take her without her tongue.	shakespearean
How is your Highness?	modern
Farewell, father.	shakespearean
I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her, And therefore let me be thus bold with you To give you over at this first encounter, Unless you will accompany me thither.	shakespearean
Welcome, wanderer.	shakespearean
Why did you send so many?	modern
If it be you that stir these daughters' hearts Against their father, fool me not so much To bear it tamely.	shakespearean
I will this night, In several hands, in at his windows throw, As if they came from several citizens, Writings all tending to the great opinion That Rome holds of his name, wherein obscurely Caesar’s ambition shall be glancèd at.	shakespearean
On, on, you noblest English, Whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof, Fathers that, like so many Alexanders, Have in these parts from morn till even fought And sheathed their swords for lack of argument.	shakespearean
Nice Grumio, bring me some.	modern
Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company, For you in my respect are all the world.	shakespearean
So art thou to revenge when thou shalt hear.	shakespearean
For Hecuba!	modern
I’ll follow you and turn this hell I’m in into a kind of heaven.	modern
Drawing your sword on a woman?	modern
Look to the lady.	shakespearean
But has Catesby gone?	modern
I can’t do this.	modern
Make it so known.	shakespearean
Let husbands know Their wives have sense like them.	shakespearean
Well, then, we’re awake.	modern
Is it possible A cur can lend three thousand ducats?” Or Shall I bend low and in a bondman’s key With bated breath and whispering humbleness Say this:	shakespearean
Tempt him not so too far.	shakespearean
Look, he wears cruel garters.	shakespearean
Give him direction for this merry bond, And I will go and purse the ducats straight, See to my house left in the fearful guard Of an unthrifty knave, and presently I will be with you.	shakespearean
Anyone who builds his hopes on air lives like a drunken sailor hanging on a mast, ready with every dizzy nod of his head to tumble to the bottom of the sea.	modern
I must join the duke for lunch.	modern
Read the time there.	modern
Give me mine armor.	shakespearean
Go to the harbor immediately!	modern
No matter what you say, my father is not dead.	modern
I would he knew that I had saved his brother.	shakespearean
Well, then he must be alive.	modern
Still, Edmund was beloved.	modern
Say goodbye to your sisters.	modern
Belike this show imports the argument of the play.	shakespearean
Heaven knows what she has known.	shakespearean
Take up the sword again, or take up me.	shakespearean
Fie, there is no such man.	shakespearean
Honest, ay, honest.	shakespearean
What, all my children and their mother dead in one fell swoop?	modern
Will you abandon her?	modern
Yet have I left a daughter.	shakespearean
Are you with a Cornish company?	modern
Go fetch fire.	shakespearean
Unto the dignity and height of fortune, The high imperial type of this earth’s glory.	shakespearean
Then certifies your Lordship that this night He dreamt the boar had razèd his helm Besides, he says there are two councils kept, And that may be determined at the one Which may make you and him to rue at th' other.	shakespearean
And for my love I pray you wrong me not.	shakespearean
The galleys Have sent a dozen sequent messengers This very night at one another’s heels, And many of the consuls, raised and met, Are at the Duke’s already.	shakespearean
What a man!—especially compared to my husband.	modern
Well, if it wasn’t her, I don’t know.	modern
Let her be round with him, And I’ll be placed, so please you, in the ear Of all their conference.	shakespearean
As ever you come of women, come in quickly to Sir John.	shakespearean
Your lips will feel them the sooner.	shakespearean
She’s full of good intentions.	modern
I say it’s the moon.	modern
The king, sir, hath laid that in a dozen passes between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits.	shakespearean
Please, just look over there.	modern
In the meantime, Let me be thought too busy in my fears— As worthy cause I have to fear I am— And hold her free, I do beseech your honor.	shakespearean
Oh noble lord, consider your lineage.	modern
Got it, sir.	modern
To the mines?	shakespearean
Go, take it up unto thy master’s use.	shakespearean
Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much I love her.	modern
I do not think ’t.	shakespearean
My mistress here lies murdered in her bed— No, heaven forbid!	modern
Oh, you’re so lucky!	modern
What is the matter, husband?	shakespearean
Give him a present.	shakespearean
I have done the deed.	modern
It isn’t proper for you to know how much Caesar loved you.	modern
Pardon me, I pray you.	shakespearean
If we meet again, then we’ll smile indeed.	modern
This is a slave whose easy borrowed pride Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows.— Out, varlet, from my sight!	shakespearean
There’s still a spot here.	modern
It’s noble Kent, your friend.	modern
He did this in public?	modern
I do think there is mettle in death, which commits some loving act upon her, she hath such a celerity in dying.	shakespearean
O thou bloody prison, Fatal and ominous to noble peers!	shakespearean
From my kind uncle, who I know will give it to me, especially as it’s not worth much.	modern
Your Highness told me to ask for my commission today.	modern
Is that possible?	modern
Let me choose now.	modern
And he would have deserved it too.	modern
Good Lord for alliance!	shakespearean
Signior Benedick served well in the war, my lady.	modern
You should get a wife!	modern
Will you walk, sir?—O Desdemona— My lord?	shakespearean
With one fool’s head I came to woo, But I go away with two.— Sweet, adieu.	shakespearean
So what if I killed her husband and her father?	modern
Fail not our feast.	shakespearean
But after many ceremonies done, He calls for wine.	shakespearean
Hurry, Messala, and I’ll look for Pindarus in the meantime.	modern
Leave me alone, Desdemona, go away!	modern
Hurry up, my Jewish friend.	modern
You can’t force me any more than Hermia can beg me.	modern
Well, let them rest.—Come hither, Catesby.	shakespearean
Tell me, you unknown power— He can read your thoughts.	modern
Even if she’s ugly, she’ll be smart enough to find a guy to sleep with her.	modern
Now sit down, everybody, and rehearse your parts—Pyramus, you start.	modern
Of lusty earls: Grandpré and Roussi, Faulconbridge and Foix, Beaumont and Marle, Vaudemont and Lestrale.	shakespearean
Wouldst thou aught with me?	shakespearean
No, my most wrongèd sister.	shakespearean
It’s too bad.	modern
Methinks I hear Antony call.	shakespearean
With that, I’ll be off.	modern
It is too heavy for your Grace to wear.	shakespearean
If to have done the thing you gave in charge Beget your happiness, be happy then, For it is done.	shakespearean
lie on her?	shakespearean
The moment they planned to act is almost here.	modern
I’m learning every hour how to be subservient.	modern
Look, here she comes!	modern
Wait, here’s a penny to heal your head.	modern
Both your majesties Might, by the sovereign power you have of us, Put your dread pleasures more into command Than to entreaty.	shakespearean
Ay, better than him I am before knows me.	shakespearean
Your majesty!	modern
I’m happy about that.	modern
But, as I can learn, He hearkens after prophecies and dreams, And from the crossrow plucks the letter  And says a wizard told him that by “G” His issue disinherited should be.	shakespearean
O sir, content you.	shakespearean
My lord, this would not be believed in Venice, Though I should swear I saw ’t.	shakespearean
Think you of a worse title, and I will fit her to it.	shakespearean
Would he not be a comfort to our travel?	shakespearean
And I’ve been avoiding him all day.	modern
Don’t forget the vows we made to each other.	modern
All may be well; but if God sort it so, 'Tis more than we deserve or I expect.	shakespearean
Good heavens!	modern
He’s still sleeping, ma'am.	modern
It’s always dangerous when little people get caught in the crossfire of mighty opponents.	modern
Let me have your attention for a moment.	modern
trick up with new-tuned oaths; and what a beard of the general’s cut and a horrid suit of the camp will do among foaming bottles and ale-washed wits is wonderful to be thought on.	shakespearean
I’ve told you I’m your friend, and I’ll stick by you.	modern
Make Cassio angry somehow, either by speaking too loud, or insulting his military skills, or however else you want.	modern
His military understanding is all theory, no practice.	modern
And my help.	shakespearean
Tell us about the letters that you got from France.	modern
Here comes Ensign Pistol and his wife.	modern
I do not think there is any such woman.	shakespearean
The Duke’s in council and your noble self, I am sure, is sent for.	shakespearean
With my music playing in the background, I’ll lure fish.	modern
Well, sir, it’s true it came soon after.	modern
Well, then, what are you messing up?	modern
Nay, by Saint Jamy, I hold you a penny, A horse and a man Is more than one And yet not many.	shakespearean
I humbly beseech you, proceed to th' affairs of state.	shakespearean
I never gave him cause.	shakespearean
Therefore ’tis certain he was not ambitious.	shakespearean
Let Merriman catch his breath—the poor dog’s foaming at the mouth.	modern
Dead, then?	shakespearean
You were best knock louder.	shakespearean
Isn’t that him on the ground?	modern
He won’t listen to anyone’s advice.	modern
I grant I am a woman, but withal A woman well-reputed, Cato’s daughter.	shakespearean
You’ll see that Caesar is giving you no reason to do so.	modern
That done, repair to Pompey’s theatre.	shakespearean
And there the snake throws her enameled skin, Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in.	shakespearean
Give order to my servants that they take No note at all of our being absent hence.— Nor you, Lorenzo.—Jessica, nor you.	shakespearean
Twill be naught, But let it be.	shakespearean
But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.	shakespearean
Who comes with him?	shakespearean
What did you mean by giving me this handkerchief?	modern
The higher Nilus swells The more it promises.	shakespearean
Edmund, go find him.	modern
Come, will you go with me?	shakespearean
Give me a calendar.	shakespearean
You do extend These thoughts of horror further than you shall Find cause in Caesar.	shakespearean
Oh, that exceeds, they say.	shakespearean
Tis her command.	shakespearean
Mark him.	shakespearean
Let him alone.	shakespearean
We’ll see about that!	modern
This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit, Which gives men stomach to digest his words With better appetite.	shakespearean
Prepare yourselves.	modern
Stay here at your own risk.	modern
Gallants, I am not as I have been.	shakespearean
Oh, be sick, great greatness, And bid thy ceremony give thee cure!	shakespearean
That’s when you gave them the spanking paddle and pulled your pants down,            Please, uncle, hire a teacher who can teach your fool to lie.	modern
If you’re smart, you’ll go home.	modern
He’s more of a soldier than a wise man.	modern
Curly golden hair moves so nicely in the wind and makes a woman beautiful.	modern
Then immediately call the rest of the watch together and thank God that you’ve gotten rid of such a criminal.	modern
O you gods!	shakespearean
Our force by land Hath nobly held.	shakespearean
It faded on the crowing of the cock.	shakespearean
And brief, good mother—I’m in a hurry.	modern
No, it is not possible you should love the enemy of France, Kate.	modern
By Jacob’s staff, I swear, I have no mind of feasting forth tonight.	shakespearean
What are you doing here alone?	modern
Then cursed she Hastings.	shakespearean
And I have met a gentleman who promises to help me find a good music tutor to instruct our lady love.	modern
He’s safe for these three hours.	shakespearean
I cannot think it.	shakespearean
O murderous slumber, Layst thou thy leaden mace upon my boy That plays thee music?—Gentle knave, good night.	shakespearean
Then, in my tent, you can elaborate on your complaints, and I’ll listen.	modern
But, till the king come forth, and not till then, Unto Southampton do we shift our scene.	shakespearean
Could you have found two Romans as good as these two?	modern
Good gentlemen, look like you’re rested and happy.	modern
Those that with haste will make a mighty fire Begin it with weak straws.	shakespearean
All the better.	shakespearean
You have all served me well, and kings are your peers.	modern
If I should speak, She would mock me into air.	shakespearean
All these quarrels are about me.	modern
His daughter and I will be king and queen—save our graces!—and Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys.—Dost thou like the plot, Trinculo?	shakespearean
I’ve proved my trustworthiness by giving myself a voluntary wound here in my thigh.	modern
And you’ll speak on the same platform as I do, after I’m done.	modern
Oh, Fate, come and cut the thread of my life.	modern
Nay, we will slink away in supper time, Disguise us at my lodging, and return, All in an hour.	shakespearean
If her breath steams up the glass, then she’s alive.	modern
I stay too long from her.	shakespearean
Please calm down, uncle.	modern
Please, remain seated.	modern
Their lips were four red roses on a stalk, And in their summer beauty kissed each other.	shakespearean

To who?	shakespearean
Look, how she blushes like a virgin!	modern
Then must you speak Of one that loved not wisely, but too well.	shakespearean
Let none presume To wear an undeservèd dignity.	shakespearean
I am sure he had more hair of his tail than I have of my face when I last saw him.	shakespearean
Thank you, sir.	modern
I’ll leave now, to set all these things right.	modern
His absence means he’s broken his promise, sir.	modern
Alas, alas!	shakespearean
If she restrained your rowdy knights, she had such a good reason that you can’t blame her for it.	modern
What things, my lord?	modern
I’m sorry to hear this.	modern
Don’t I have a reason to be angry, you disobedient hags?	modern
For both our sakes, I would that word were true.	shakespearean
What do you want?	modern
I never heard So musical a discord, such sweet thunder.	shakespearean
Then keep thy vow, sirrah, when thou meet’st the fellow.	shakespearean
Thou hast seen these signs.	shakespearean
Then we are rid of Litio.	shakespearean
Should I tend your pigs and eat husks with them?	modern
But repetition of what thou hast marred.	shakespearean
Why art thou here, Come from the farthest step of India?	shakespearean
I remember the first time Caesar ever put it on.	modern
I swear that Claudio will pay dearly for this.	modern
Tomorrow shall you bear our full intent Back to our brother England.	shakespearean
And no one eat any onions or garlic.	modern
But you’re keeping a hundred knights here who are so disorderly, vulgar, and obnoxious that our noble court is starting to look like a noisy cheap hotel.	modern
Many men seek their fortune at seventeen; at eighty, it’s a bit late.	modern
Benedick, did you notice Signior Leonato’s daughter?	modern
What’s amazing is how long he lasted.	modern
Go to him, Dolabella, bid him yield.	shakespearean
He’s without equal!	modern
The only possible interest I could take in you would be to hit you on the head with a stool, paint your face with blood, and make a fool out of you.	modern
Then tell me if Antonio can be called a brother.	modern
Oh, I could weep my soul right out of myself!	modern
Let sorrow split my heart if ever I Did hate thee or thy father.	shakespearean
When holy and devout religious men Are at their beads, ’tis much to draw them thence, So sweet is zealous contemplation.	shakespearean
I am not here to disprove what Brutus has said, but to say what  I think there’s a lot of sense in what he says.	modern
Am I not an inch of fortune better than she?	shakespearean
But, hang on!	modern
Their preparation is today by sea.	shakespearean
But how should Prospero Be living and be here?	shakespearean
A snail?	modern
Lord, what fools these mortals be!	shakespearean
Well, at least that’s something.	modern
I never gave him any token of romantic love.	modern
Take you assurance of her cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum.	shakespearean
I did, sir, but it didn’t answer me.	modern
My good lord— You’ve always been a liar.	modern
Please go on.	modern
If you refuse it, the whole country will regret it.	modern
All things that are, Are with more spirit chasèd than enjoyed.	shakespearean
I will go with thee.	shakespearean
Friendship is constant in all other things Save in the office and affairs of love.	shakespearean
His letter will tell you how he’s doing.	modern
Why should I not?	shakespearean
Caesar sits down in Alexandria, where I will oppose his fate.	shakespearean
I don’t know about that.	modern
Why have you gotten so rude?	modern
Why do you cross me in this exigent?	shakespearean
I will not say so, for fear I should be faced out of my way.	shakespearean
Leah gave it to me before we were married.	modern
Most certain.	shakespearean
I’m about to fly away.	modern
We You won’t pay for the glasses you smashed?	modern
Then I’ll water all those precious herbs with my tears to make them grow.	modern
It usually only lasts about twenty seconds.	modern
I can’t do everything I want to, but I’ll help you as well as I can.	modern
An honest man he is, and hates the slime That sticks on filthy deeds.	shakespearean
There is more sense in that than in reputation.	shakespearean
A boy robbed you, but you’ll beat up the post instead.	modern
You lie, you disgusting tyrant.	modern
But in this case of wooing, A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.	shakespearean
Where is my love?	shakespearean
Even he that makes her queen.	shakespearean
No, sir, God forbid, but ashamed to kiss.	shakespearean
Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause, Lest I be laughed at when I tell them so.	shakespearean
He seeks my life.	shakespearean
Why, you silly man!	modern
Good idea.	modern
Hark, Petruchio: she says she’ll see thee hanged first.	shakespearean
Casca, be sudden, for we fear prevention —Brutus, what shall be done?	shakespearean
The actors are here.	modern
But if he’s resistant and chilly, then be like that too and break off the conversation.	modern
Has it come to this?	modern
Don’t talk to me.	modern
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven Upon the place beneath.	shakespearean
You’ll see shortly how the murderer wins the love of Gonzago’s wife.	modern
You haven’t said anything against the Duke of Cornwall, have you?	modern
Illo, ho, ho, my lord!	shakespearean
I shall obey you in all fair commands.	shakespearean
Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I wore it?	shakespearean
The ship was already sailing.	modern
Foreign savages who eat their own children for dinner will be as close to my heart as you, ex-daughter of mine.	modern
And here I am, going crazy in the middle of the woods because I can’t find my Hermia.	modern
Is not this buckled well?	shakespearean
This tune goes manly.	shakespearean
Thus I do escape the sorrow Of Antony’s death.	shakespearean
A most unhappy one.	shakespearean
Have you returned smiling from the great battle for the world?	modern
That’s the consideration that makes us stretch out our sufferings so long.	modern
That’s him, madam.	modern

My lord, they stay for you to give your daughter to her husband.	shakespearean
No, not a whit.	shakespearean
A laughter.	shakespearean
What dost thou with thy best apparel on?	shakespearean
I pray you sir, go forth And give us truth who ’tis that is arrived.	shakespearean
It’s pretty.	modern
Think so, Iago?	shakespearean
When the day comes, I’ll wish it were nighttime, so I could sleep with the legal expert’s clerk.	modern
And you, sister?	modern
A good name.	modern
O dear!	shakespearean
I’ll go see my mother soon.	modern
Listen but speak not to ’t.	shakespearean
Whip me, you devils, so I don’t have to look at this heavenly sight!	modern
Proculeius, Caesar has heard about what you’ve done here and has sent for you.	modern
Nathaniel’s coat was being fixed, sir.	modern
I had no idea she was cheating on me.	modern
In that case, if I can wear a mask, let me play Thisbe too!	modern
Tis true.	shakespearean
I hope you have good weather to set your mind at ease.	modern
He is the prince of horses.	modern
I have a ship Laden with gold.	shakespearean
Well, God-'a'-mercy.	shakespearean
You must not think I am so simple but I know the devil himself will not eat a woman.	shakespearean

Captain Macmorris, I beg your pardon, but would you grant me a discussion or two with you, see, partly touching on or concerning the practice of war, the Roman wars, for the sake of argument, see, and friendly conversation?	modern
Come on, music!	modern
My lord, my lord— I don’t want to hear any more about it.	modern
I’m a fool.—Let’s go, Lorenzo.—Goodbye for now.	modern
I would lose all—ay, sacrifice them all Here to this devil—to deliver you.	shakespearean

I serve you, madam.	shakespearean
I pray thee, moralize them.	shakespearean
Oh, evil, evil!	modern
The business of this man looks out of him.	shakespearean
Yes, I’ll go.	modern
This is a miracle, if you talk of miracles.	modern
Some kinds of baseness Are nobly undergone.	shakespearean
The best news is that we have safely found Our king and company.	shakespearean
I cry you mercy, uncle.—By your Grace’s pardon.	shakespearean
My father’s love is enough to honor him.	shakespearean
It’s nothing, my lord.	modern
My name is Roderigo.	shakespearean
Nay, you must call me Rosalind.—Come, sister, will you go?	shakespearean
Oh, a thousand of them, all of which I’ve forgotten.	modern
There is no other way, Unless thou couldst put on some other shape And not be Richard, that hath done all this.	shakespearean
So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to ’t.	shakespearean
I must take out the work?	shakespearean
Our imminent separation so occupies our thoughts that even though you stay here, you come with me, and even though I leave here, I stay with you.	modern
God be with all of you, princes.	modern
Then, at my farm I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail, Six score fat oxen standing in my stalls, And all things answerable to this portion.	shakespearean
What though I killed her husband and her father?	shakespearean
Now, what news on the Rialto?	shakespearean
How fares your majesty?	shakespearean
Wherefore to Dover, sir?	shakespearean

Well, there you go.	modern
We are resolved, my lord.	shakespearean
Not that I know of.	modern
I’ll vouch for Grumio.	modern
I don’t like his face.	modern
Are Englishmen really such heavy drinkers?	modern
Brutus, bait not me.	shakespearean
This is what it’s all about— Please, I beg you— No, my lord, I’m comfortable like this, thank you.	modern
Wilt come?	shakespearean
Dost thou hear?	shakespearean
If you prick us with a pin, don’t we bleed?	modern
Ay, that Petruchio came.	shakespearean

The star is fall’n.	shakespearean
Come, how wouldst thou praise me?	shakespearean
He’s worth no more.	shakespearean
The king will be angry with him.	modern
Mistress, your father prays you leave your books And help to dress your sister’s chamber up.	shakespearean
Has there ever been a time—I’d really like to know—when I’ve definitely said something was true, and it turned out not to be true?	modern
I’ve been up all night.	modern
Where is your servant Caius?	shakespearean
But as it stands, I wish I could believe it wasn’t.	modern
Why, dear child?	modern
Prepare your troops.	modern
I’ll look into it further.	modern
But please tell me, sir, is your marriage  Let him do his worst.	modern
Oh, come apace, dispatch!	shakespearean
But come, my lord, let’s go.	modern
My letters are ready to go.	modern
Only to watch that title become worthless, as her mother has.	modern
Such welcome and unwelcome things at once 'Tis hard to reconcile.	shakespearean
In troth, I think thou wouldst not.	shakespearean
Yet Count Claudio may hear, for what I would speak of concerns him.	shakespearean
Now a little fire in a wild field were like an old lecher’s heart—a small spark, all the rest on ’s body cold.	shakespearean
So have a seat and talk to her.	modern
Tis mine and I will have it.	shakespearean
No, not at all— All right, all right.	modern
Yes, ’tis Emilia.— 'Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio’s death, The noise was high.	shakespearean
Now sir, this granted—as it is a most pregnant and unforced position—who stands so eminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does?	shakespearean
Unarm, Eros.	shakespearean
What is this That rises like the issue of a king, And wears upon his baby-brow the round And top of sovereignty?	shakespearean
That now I will have—that’s the humor of it.	shakespearean
I would have sworn that, too, my lord, especially against Benedick.	modern
Cleopatra summoned him.	modern
To th’ monument!	shakespearean
Marked you not How that the guilty kindred of the queen Looked pale when they did hear of Clarence' death?	shakespearean
Do you have anything else to tell me?	modern

And though you know my inwardness and love Is very much unto the Prince and Claudio, Yet, by mine honor, I will deal in this As secretly and justly as your soul Should with your body.	shakespearean
It’d be impossible for you to watch them, even if they were as horny as animals in heat and as stupid as drunks.	modern
My brother Gloucester’s voice?	modern
I’m happy the Dauphin has such a good sense of humor.	modern
I would have blowed up the town, so Chrish save me, la, in an hour.	shakespearean

I don’t until you practice them on me.	modern
Very vilely in the morning, when he is sober, and most vilely in the afternoon, when he is drunk.	shakespearean

My wit’s diseased.	shakespearean
Every one of us is a criminal.	modern
Heavens make our presence and our practices Pleasant and helpful to him!	shakespearean
For England his approaches makes as fierce As waters to the sucking of a gulf.	shakespearean
Who wouldst thou serve?	shakespearean
Or do you play the flouting jack, to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder and Vulcan a rare carpenter?	shakespearean
How did they die?	modern
Goes Fleance with you?	shakespearean
Indeed, my lord, the gloomy Jaques grieves over these deaths.	modern
Kent can speak rudely when Lear goes mad.	modern
And I’ll sleep.	shakespearean
Alas, good Kate, I will not burden thee, For knowing thee to be but young and light— Too light for such a swain as you to catch, And yet as heavy as my weight should be.	shakespearean
And make sure the servants are less friendly to his knights.	modern
You’ve been competing with this king for my daughter.	modern
Good madam, stay a while.	shakespearean
Faith, he tonight hath boarded a land carrack.	shakespearean
And therefore will come.	shakespearean
Not a bit, madam.	modern
Are you a god, an angel, or a devil, that you make my blood turn cold and my hair stand up?	modern
Who ever saw the heavens threaten like this?	modern
Shall I strike at it with my partisan?	shakespearean
We should speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.	modern
I am afraid, methinks, to hear you tell it.	shakespearean
Being so frustrate, tell him, he mocks The pauses that he makes.	shakespearean
Why, what an ass am I!	shakespearean
So, possessing neither a voice nor a heart for flattery, I can’t awaken the spirit of love in her so as to make him appear in his true likeness.	modern
What did you think about that French lord, Monsieur le Bon?	modern
Greetings, dearest Caesar!	modern
Let us be jocund.	shakespearean
Gentle Octavia, Let your best love draw to that point which seeks Best to preserve it.	shakespearean
There’s a spirit in here!	modern
What will you do?	shakespearean
But I’m a hired hand: I don’t profit from the flocks I tend.	modern
What an idiot that monster is!	modern
Are you begging, brother?	modern
Are they so followed?	shakespearean
I will not hurt him.	shakespearean
But since you come from him, you’re saturated with his healing spirit.	modern
Where did he go?	modern
My fair Bianca, bid my father welcome, while I with equal affection welcome yours.	modern
A little before twelve, I think.	modern
Wait, let me hire him too.—Here’s my fool’s cap, a token of my gratitude.	modern
On a night like this a campfire in an empty field would be like the heart of a dirty old man—a tiny spark in a cold body.	modern
And I have reason for it.	shakespearean
Nothing but “little” and “short”!— Why are you letting her insult me like this?	modern
Then ’tis like the breath of an unfee’d lawyer.	shakespearean
Then by your side no bed room me deny.	shakespearean
Come, let’s go to the dance.	modern
Well, let’s have it, Grumio.	modern
With what, i' th' name of God?	shakespearean
Will you hear me, Roderigo?	shakespearean
But the devil that tempted you gave you no reason why you should commit treason other than to win the name of traitor.	modern
And, sister, as the winds give benefit And convey is assistant, do not sleep, But let me hear from you.	shakespearean
As long as that?	modern
I hope this explanation will stand as my excuse.	modern
If you mark Alexander’s life well, Harry of Monmouth’s life is come after it indifferent well, for there is figures in all things.	shakespearean
She false with Cassio!	shakespearean
But as ’tis, We cannot miss him.	shakespearean
But we already swore, sir.	modern
I beseech your pardon.	shakespearean
People in high positions are shaken by many blasts of wind, and when they fall, they shatter into pieces.	modern
No, that same wicked bastard of Venus that was begot of thought, conceived of spleen, and born of madness, that blind rascally boy that abuses everyone’s eyes because his own are out, let him be judge how deep I am in love.	shakespearean
He is no less than a stuffed man.	shakespearean
I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.	shakespearean
Worthy gentleman!	shakespearean
Likewise, I’m young, and my sense of reason has just ripened.	modern
An evil soul producing holy witness Is like a villain with a smiling cheek, A goodly apple rotten at the heart.	shakespearean
It orders me to hand the noble duke of Clarence over to you.	modern
Time shall unfold what plighted cunning hides, Who covers faults at last with shame derides.	shakespearean
Nay then, come on, and take the chance of anger.	shakespearean
See, now I have you.	modern
So think carefully about what you want, beautiful Hermia.	modern
The law has another hold on you.	modern
I’ve been poisoned.	modern
Do you see, gentlemen?	shakespearean
They’re coming.	modern
In God’s name, what art thou?	shakespearean
But God forbid he says no to us!	modern
I have a pretty good ear for music.	modern
Come, let’s away.	shakespearean
He is in heaven, where you will never go.	modern
He’s too argumentative for me.	modern
So help me every spirit sanctified As I have spoken for you all my best And stood within the blank of his displeasure For my free speech.	shakespearean
You go down toward the Capitol, and I’ll go this way.	modern
Therefore I say again that he must have used some powerful drug or magic potion on her.	modern
Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me.	shakespearean
That huge black cloud over there looks like a filthy liquor jug that’s about to pour out its contents.	modern
If this were true, then should I know this secret.	shakespearean
For ’tis most easy Th' inclining Desdemona to subdue In any honest suit.	shakespearean
No, and swears she never will.	shakespearean
We might as well send orders to the whale to come ashore as try to restore order in soldiers carried away with their looting.	modern
Methinks thy voice is altered, and thou speak’st In better phrase and matter than thou didst.	shakespearean
Sit, Jessica.	shakespearean
I will set down what comes from her, to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly.	shakespearean
I meddle with no tradesman’s matters nor women’s matters, but withal I am indeed, sir, a surgeon to old shoes.	shakespearean
It’s absolutely true, so take good care of it.	modern
I fear he will.	shakespearean
As for myself, I didn’t dare laugh, for fear of opening my lips and inhaling the stinking air.	modern
A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse!	shakespearean
My friends told me as much, and I thought no less.	shakespearean
Made she no verbal question?	shakespearean
Do you not know I am a woman?	shakespearean
Cried he?	shakespearean
Faith, that was not so well.	shakespearean
Nay, but he prated And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms Against your honor That, with the little godliness I have, I did full hard forbear him.	shakespearean
I can’t stand her.	modern
It’s true, Hero says so.	modern
It’s the same kind of guy who got you upset and made you suspect I’d cheated on you with the Moor.	modern
Nay, that’s true, that’s very true.	shakespearean
His passport shall be made, And crowns for convoy put into his purse.	shakespearean
I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are.	shakespearean
Ay, my liege, so please you give us leave.	shakespearean
How many things in life seem good to us because of when they happen!	modern
Your features, God help us!	modern
O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!	shakespearean
Even such a husband Hast thou of me as she is for a wife.	shakespearean
Cry mercy, lords and watchful gentlemen, That you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here.	shakespearean
Draw your trustworthy sword, which you have used in such service to your country.	modern
I am not made of stones, But penetrable to your kind entreaties, Albeit against my conscience and my soul.	shakespearean
Your cheeks are too flushed for me to believe that was a fake faint.	modern
He’ll make your Paris Louvre shake for it, Were it the mistress court of mighty Europe.	shakespearean
But I don’t hate Orlando.	modern
Madam, keep up hope.	modern
You wrong me in every way.	modern
Stanley, Richmond is your wife’s son.	modern
An’t please your Majesty, ’tis the gage of one that I should fight withal, if he be alive.	shakespearean
My lord, you shall o'errule my mind for once.— Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?	shakespearean
Look, look, a mouse!	shakespearean
Listen they’re howling.	modern
If we meet Macbeth’s army tonight, let us be beaten if we cannot fight.	modern
They are my daylight, my life.	modern
Look out, I’m on my way up.	modern
Is it all come to this?	modern
You’ll become a wood salesman and buy nothing but clubs from me.	modern
An they will take it, so.	shakespearean
Do we all holy rites.	shakespearean
Tell me thine first.	shakespearean
The skies are painted with unnumbered sparks.	shakespearean
I do desire no more.	shakespearean
You told me you hated him.	modern
What would my lord?	shakespearean
Father is on the lookout.	modern
Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical?	shakespearean
Space enough Have I in such a prison.	shakespearean
Whose was it?	modern
Don’t insult my master’s generosity by killing yourself.	modern
Go away.	modern
Tie him up like a thief and bring him here to me.	modern
But you see my finger doesn’t have the ring on it.	modern
If you dressed only to stay warm, you wouldn’t need these gorgeous clothes you’re wearing—which don’t keep you warm at all.	modern
Well, so-so.	modern
The more fool you for laying on my duty.	shakespearean
At last I left them I' th' filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell, There dancing up to th' chins, that the foul lake O'erstunk their feet.	shakespearean
Wait just a minute, you brazen hussy.	modern
Give me mine angle.	shakespearean
Then where would you have me go, Adam?	modern
I find not Myself disposed to sleep.	shakespearean
I’m sticking to the contract.	modern
I don’t even know you.	modern
And with my hand I seal my true heart’s love.	shakespearean
Now spurs the lated traveler apace To gain the timely inn, and near approaches The subject of our watch.	shakespearean
Telling you where he’s sleeping is like telling you where I’m lying.	modern
But I have known people who sleepwalked and weren’t guilty of anything.	modern
He’s here, sir, but please don’t bother him.	modern
That’s a lame threat from a toy gun, a poor individual’s private displeasure with a monarch.	modern
I’ll wait patiently.	modern
Here, take my sword.	modern
So was I when your Highness took his dukedom.	shakespearean
Go ahead, then.	modern
Tell us, Othello.	modern
He was wont to call me usurer; let him look to his bond.	shakespearean
Oh, dainty duck!	modern
Oh, I’m dying, Horatio!	modern
Use it for my love some other way than swearing by it.	shakespearean
Isn’t she a well-mannered young lady?	modern
What do you have to say to me now?	modern
It’s a lie, you thread, you thimble, you measurement!	modern
That Herod’s head I’ll have!	shakespearean
Maybe I should ask you what right you have to take me, but I’ll take you, Orlando, to be my husband.	modern
Look how cheerful my mother is, only two hours after my father died.	modern
I feel tortured by all this talking.	modern
Play with your fancies and in them behold, Upon the hempen tackle, shipboys climbing.	shakespearean
They deserved to keep their heads more than some people who have managed to keep their positions.	modern
Signior, it is the Moor.	shakespearean
Infect her beauty, You fen-sucked fogs drawn by the powerful sun, To fall and blister!	shakespearean
Behold, sir.	shakespearean
He must do this, or I’ll recant the pardon I just delivered.	modern
Get out of my sight!	modern
And here comes the warden, just in time.	modern
No one has ever faked passion as skillfully as this, then.	modern
Think you so?	shakespearean
But only hint at this vaguely, because, as you know, my mother’s still alive.	modern
Not we.	shakespearean
Moreover, he hath left you all his walks, His private arbors and new-planted orchards, On this side Tiber.	shakespearean
Cough them up.	modern
Shortly shall all my labors end, and thou Shalt have the air at freedom.	shakespearean
Go now and get cash.	modern
I may not breathe my censure What he might be.	shakespearean
The moblèd queen”?	shakespearean
Wait until I read the letter.	modern
Come, gentlemen, let’s go in.	modern
Some five or six and thirty of his knights, Hot questrists after him, met him at gate, Who with some other of the lord’s dependants Are gone with him towards Dover, where they boast To have well-armèd friends.	shakespearean
Yes, I have great cause to be thankful.	modern
You don’t need eyes to see how the world works.	modern
Are they returned?	shakespearean
And now they do re-stem Their backward course, bearing with frank appearance Their purposes toward Cyprus.	shakespearean
That’s fouler.	shakespearean
Oh, he’s crazy, Laertes!	modern
I have offended reputation, A most unnoble swerving.	shakespearean
Sirrah, naked fellow— Poor Tom’s a-cold.	shakespearean
Lay her in the ground, and let violets bloom from her lovely and pure flesh!	modern
Yes, just.	shakespearean
If there were anything inside their heads, they could never wear such heavy helmets.	modern
Silence that dreadful bell, it frights the isle From her propriety.	shakespearean
What is thy will with her?	shakespearean
How chance the king comes with so small a train?	shakespearean
There’s ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark But he’s an arrant knave.	shakespearean
You’re on.	modern
They’re speaking to him.	modern
They do me wrong, and I will not endure it!	shakespearean
She is our principal demand—one of the first points of the treaty.	modern
None that I know will be; much that I fear may chance.	shakespearean
You don’t wish we had more help from England anymore, cousin?	modern
It’s the death of half the world.	modern
Why,       Am I not i' th' right, old Jephthah?	shakespearean
Don’t even think about refusing.	modern
Doesn’t a Jew have eyes?	modern
It’s mine and I’m going to get it.	modern
Why, man, they did make love to this employment.	shakespearean
What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food, Or with a base and boist'rous sword enforce A thievish living on the common road?	shakespearean
All the world’s a stage, And all the men and women merely players.	shakespearean
On their sustaining garments not a blemish, But fresher than before.	shakespearean
Ay, with Cassio.	shakespearean
If I had three ears I’d listen with all three.	modern
but you see my finger Hath not the ring upon it.	shakespearean
I tell you, though, it’s incredible how much she loves me.	modern
I have forgotten your name, but you were well cast in the role and played it convincingly.	modern
Soak your hands in blood and gore, since you have cut the thread of his life with scissors.	modern
You have some cause; they have not.	shakespearean
He’s a lord to a lord and a man to a man.	modern
Well, sir, get you in.	shakespearean
Is that possible?	modern
He would have gotten a pension of six pence a day for his whole life.	modern
But please tell me, who’s his best friend?	modern
This naughty man Shall face to face be brought to Margaret, Who I believe was packed in all this wrong, Hired to it by your brother.	shakespearean
It’s not yet daylight.	modern
What’s the name of this forest behind us?	modern
The deal is closed.	modern
Who can command the forest and make the trees pull their roots out of the earth?	modern
Then stand with us.	shakespearean
He is slain.	shakespearean
I have a thing for you.	shakespearean
Convey her to my tent.	shakespearean
Lovell, go as fast as you can to Doctor Shaw.	modern
Know, my hearts, I hope well of tomorrow, and will lead you Where rather I’ll expect victorious life Than death and honor.	shakespearean
But first, I have to tell you that Desdemona’s completely in love with him.	modern
How now, brother Edmund?	shakespearean
No, since.	shakespearean
There my Lysander and myself shall meet.	shakespearean
Come on, put it away.	modern
The third o’ th’ world is yours, which with a snaffle You may pace easy, but not such a wife.	shakespearean
He won’t fight with me, Domitius?	modern
Thy death and fortunes bid thy followers fly.	shakespearean
Send for the man and ask him.	shakespearean
Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!	shakespearean
In any case, our survival depends on putting together the strongest force possible.	modern
You’ve said, sir.	shakespearean
O brave monster!	shakespearean
This thou shalt answer.	shakespearean
I would have none but knaves follow it since a fool gives it.	shakespearean
Oh, that your Highness knew my heart in this: I never loved my brother in my life.	shakespearean
What, household stuff?	shakespearean
Clouds, dissolve into rain, so that I could say the gods themselves are weeping!	modern
He’ll but break a comparison or two on me, which, peradventure not marked or not laughed at, strikes him into melancholy, and then there’s a partridge wing saved, for the fool will eat no supper that night.	shakespearean
By Jesus, he will defend his position on the practices of the ancient Roman wars as well as any military man in the world.	modern
Since this prize is yours, Be happy with it, and don’t look for a new one.	modern
Call Claudio and some other of my men.	shakespearean
I doubt not of your wisdom.	shakespearean
Since if the sun breeds maggots on a dead dog, kissing the corpse—by the way, do you have a daughter?	modern
I hope I enjoy wearing it, for my heart is very heavy.	modern
Oh Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!	modern
Push home.	shakespearean
I know what I’m talking about.	modern
Nay, but I bar tonight.	shakespearean
What should we do about that?	modern
Come, Casca, you and I will yet ere day See Brutus at his house.	shakespearean
Nor I neither.	shakespearean
There must be something in the air here.	modern
I can’t imagine what’s made him so unlike himself, other than his father’s death.	modern
As it ebbs, the seedsman Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain, And shortly comes to harvest.	shakespearean
I’m asking you to understand my point of view.	modern
He’d stay up all night and all day if he didn’t drink himself to sleep.	modern
How exactly have I offended you?	modern
We were pushed out of power by evil deeds, as you call them.	modern
What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?	shakespearean
These gloves the Count sent me, they are an excellent perfume.	shakespearean
Stand back, boy.	modern
Tis but a little way that I can bring you, For I attend here.	shakespearean
You shall not go.	shakespearean
With robbers' hands my hospitable favors You should not ruffle thus.	shakespearean
I’ve come to say farewell to my king and master.	modern
Brave Iago, how honest and trustworthy you are!	modern
I don’t dare come down—forgive me, my lord—I don’t dare, for fear of capture.	modern
And squabble?	shakespearean
We’re done for!	modern
I pardon that man’s life.	shakespearean
Maybe he is not well.	shakespearean
True, he has an excellent reputation.	modern
She’s but the sign and semblance of her honor.	shakespearean
I shall the effect of this good lesson keep As watchman to my heart.	shakespearean
So pardon him, dear father, for my sake.	modern
It goes along with being born to greatness, but it makes you get badmouthed by every fool who only has his own suffering to care about.	modern
Who can arraign me for ’t?	shakespearean
For if such actions may have passage free, Bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.	shakespearean
Go get my best clothes.	modern
So that she may live, I’ll say I cheated on Edward and that she is not really his child.	modern
But I don’t have any good sides.	modern
Those of you who are young and active, I beg you to follow them and keep them from doing the crazy things their guilt might push them to do.	modern
I wouldn’t commit so serious a crime for anything.	modern
I’ll make Oliver find him.	modern
God save the king!	modern
The foul practice Hath turned itself on me.	shakespearean
Prithee, my king, be quiet.	shakespearean
He shall stay my leisure.	shakespearean
So cheer up.	modern
He will have only justice and his penalty.	modern
No, but the barber’s assistant has been seen with him.	modern
You would make a nasty suitor.	modern
I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it Nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth That the world masters.	shakespearean
Signor Antonio, many a time and oft In the Rialto you have rated me About my moneys and my usances.	shakespearean
Right now I’d give a thousand	modern
It’s difficult to bring two friends together, but even mountains can be moved together by earthquakes.	modern
The sorrow that I have by right is yours, And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.	shakespearean
My noble kinsman, welcome.	modern
God, what a burden on you I must have been!	modern
Yet leave our cousin Katherine here with us.	shakespearean
Well, I’m glad that everything has been sorted out.	modern
What do you mean, “in a strange way”?	modern
I will ask him for my place again, he shall tell me I am a drunkard.	shakespearean
If it’s for me, don’t keep it from me.	modern
God knows I loved my niece, And she is dead, slandered to death by villains That dare as well answer a man indeed As I dare take a serpent by the tongue.— Boys, apes, braggarts, jacks, milksops!	shakespearean
I' th' clout, i' th' clout.	shakespearean
Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue Should become kings of Naples?	shakespearean
Thou dost thy office fairly.	shakespearean
I do attend here on the general And think it no addition, nor my wish, To have him see me womaned.	shakespearean
But let me hear the letter of your friend.	shakespearean
Oh, I hate looking at his face now!	modern
Go on, get out of here.	modern
Why I should fear I know not, Since guiltiness I know not.	shakespearean
What, that’s all?	modern
Don’t think I’m in love with him just because I’m asking about him.	modern
Yet I profess curing it by counsel.	shakespearean
If your Majesty would like, I’ll muster up my friends and meet you wherever and whenever you like.	modern
Is not this the day That Hermia should give answer of her choice?	shakespearean
One aloof stand sentinel.	shakespearean
O, O, O, O.	shakespearean
Bless your heart.	modern
Madam, I’d better leave now.	modern
List his discourse of war, and you shall hear A fearful battle rendered you in music.	shakespearean
Your cause of sorrow Must not be measured by his worth, for then It hath no end.	shakespearean
I shall obey, my lord.	shakespearean
I wouldn’t care about my spirits, if my legs weren’t tired.	modern
As far, my lord, as will fill up the time 'Twixt this and supper.	shakespearean
Tis a world to see, How tame, when men and women are alone, A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.— Give me thy hand, Kate.	shakespearean
I think there must be something invigorating about death, since she dies with such enthusiasm.	modern
Proof enough to misuse the Prince, to vex Claudio, to undo Hero, and kill Leonato.	shakespearean
Draw together.	shakespearean
I had rather be a peddler.	shakespearean
I said so, dear Katherine; and I must not blush to affirm it.	shakespearean
Did ’t not wake you?	shakespearean
That she did.	modern
You sent for me, sir?	modern
If someone like me is fit to be king, let me know.	modern
Of brave earls, Grandpré and Roussi, Fauconberg and Foix, Beaumont and Marle, Vaudemont and Lestrale.	modern
If you’re going to lend us this money, don’t lend it to us as if we were your friends.	modern
Oh, Pomfret, Pomfret!	modern
Be bold, and take thy stand.	shakespearean
I swear, before I die I’m going to see you sick with love.	modern
Know you not, master, to some kind of men Their graces serve them but as enemies?	shakespearean
Draw, you rascal.	shakespearean
The order was reversed.	shakespearean
Therefore bear up and board 'em.—Servant- monster, drink to me.	shakespearean
Our friends are all waiting for you.	modern
I’ve already sent the proof in my letters.	modern
There’s something downright unnatural about it, if a philosopher stopped to think about it.	modern
My lord, that would dishonor him!	shakespearean
Not I, my lord.	shakespearean
It must be your imagination then, and not theirs.	shakespearean
I tell you, you would find the rituals of war and, I promise you, its ceremonies and its solicitudes and its forms and its gravity and its discipline all to be quite counter to all this noise.	modern
They say the horses ate each other.	modern
Why, here is the order to prove it.	modern
I’m afraid something dangerous is coming toward you.	modern
How now, you dog?	shakespearean
And I’ll help you.	modern
I do love it better than laughing.	shakespearean
You will never be able to say the same about me.	modern
She that herself will sliver and disbranch From her material sap perforce must wither And come to deadly use.	shakespearean
And the business you have broached here cannot be without you, especially that of Cleopatra’s, which wholly depends on your abode.	shakespearean
Goodbye, sir.	modern
Fare you well, my liege.	shakespearean
This tempest will not give me leave to ponder On things would hurt me more.	shakespearean
The problem is in what the letter says, as far as I can tell.	modern
Write to him— I will subscribe—gentle adieus and greetings.	shakespearean
Why should he have followed you?	modern
Your descendants will be kings, even though you will not be one.	modern
Nay, you were a fragment Of Gneius Pompey’s, besides what hotter hours, Unregistered in vulgar fame, you have Luxuriously picked out.	shakespearean
I swear to you by Rosalind’s own pretty hand that I am that unfortunate man.	modern
In saving you I consider myself well paid.	modern
No, please good Meg, I’ll wear this one.	modern
He woke up the whole house with his loud and cowardly screams.	modern
Why will My lord do so?	shakespearean
If he be absent, bring his brother to me.	shakespearean
Is it a man?	shakespearean
This approves her letter That she would soon be here.	shakespearean
But his frail heart, too weak to grapple with such a conflict between joy and sadness, gave out.	modern
We don’t have any music that can’t be heard.	modern
honor you.	modern
I will incontinently drown myself.	shakespearean
Nay, hear him.	shakespearean
Hey monster, the spirit you’ve been talking about, the one you call harmless, has been playing tricks on us.	modern
Give me your present to give to Master Bassanio.	modern
He wants the child for himself, to accompany him on his wanderings through the wild forests.	modern
You do remember all the circumstance?	shakespearean
This poor virgin isn’t much to look at, sir, but she’s mine.	modern
Were I a common laugher, or did use To stale with ordinary oaths my love To every new protester, if you know That I do fawn on men and hug them hard And, after, scandal them, or if you know That I profess myself in banqueting To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.	shakespearean
Besides—I ha' not since put up my sword— Against the Capitol I met a lion, Who glared upon me and went surly by, Without annoying me.	shakespearean
Ay, madam.	shakespearean
No, it would be better to speak first and kiss only after you’ve run out of things to say.	modern
I’d never play pranks on you.	modern
There’s always a breath of fresh air here.	modern
He’s fine and healthy, madam.	modern
In faith, she’s too curst.	shakespearean
There’s no way to read a man’s mind by looking at his face.	modern
Oh, and monsieur, be careful not to break the honey-sac.	modern
Now go thy way.	shakespearean
There you go.	modern
We’ll no more meet, no more see one another.	shakespearean
These lords seem so astonished that they’ve lost their use of reason and can hardly believe what they see with their own eyes.—But whatever the reason for your losing your senses, you can know for sure that I’m Prospero, that same duke who was kicked out of Milan and landed on this same island where you landed, and became the lord of it.	modern
It gives me wonder great as my content To see you here before me.	shakespearean
We, Hermia, like two artificial gods, Have with our needles created both one flower, Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion, Both warbling of one song, both in one key, As if our hands, our sides, voices, and minds, Had been incorporate.	shakespearean
Doth not my wit become me rarely?	shakespearean
If not, I’ll leave you alone and that’ll be the end of my business.	modern
Smile you my speeches as I were a fool?	shakespearean
Why, what wouldst thou do there before I go?	shakespearean
You think of him too much.	shakespearean
Who is ’t that can inform me?	shakespearean
Listen to our horses neighing, longing to be working.	modern
There are ten thousand— Geese, you idiot?	modern
In troth, ’tis morning.	shakespearean
This to be true I do engage my life.	shakespearean
I swear by the sun that when I leave here, it will be as your faithful servant.	modern
I know what you’d do.	modern
My daughter told me everything.	modern
You say not right, old man.	shakespearean
And most dear actors, eat no onions nor garlic, for we are to utter sweet breath.	shakespearean
Your ghost walks the earth and turns our swords toward our own stomachs.	modern
Demetrius doesn’t think so, and that’s all that matters.	modern
What, is my beaver easier than it was?	shakespearean
To feed my humor, wish thyself no harm.	shakespearean
What kind of god art thou, that suffer’st more Of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers?	shakespearean
I don’t doubt your wisdom.	modern
Pardon, my lord.	shakespearean
This guy will tell us everything.	modern
I lead a charmed life, which can’t be ended by anyone born from a woman.	modern
But you won’t take his flesh if he can’t pay.	modern
Go back to where you’re staying and go to sleep.	modern
Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.	shakespearean
You have been nobly borne.	shakespearean
She’s always talking when I want to sleep.	modern
If we aren’t relieved in an hour, we have to return to our barracks.	modern
What do you mean, do I think so?	modern
A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio.	shakespearean
A friendly eye could never see such faults.	shakespearean
Ah, good old Kent said this would happen—that poor, banished man.	modern

Most certain.	shakespearean
I must be gone.	shakespearean
Why are you curious, Iago?	modern
At his best he’s a little less than a man, and at his worst he’s little more than an animal.	modern
The larger part, the main body of cavalry, are coming with Cassius.	modern
Not for the wide world.	shakespearean
Be angry when you will, it shall have scope.	shakespearean
And this way have you well expounded it.	shakespearean
Nor I know not Where I did lodge last night.	shakespearean
Sir, he answered me in the roundest manner he would not.	shakespearean
Here is the place, my lord.	shakespearean
What’s thy passion?	shakespearean
I wish I had!	modern
Yes, he’ll weep stones, as he taught us to do.	modern
It’s absurd.	modern

O Margaret, Margaret, now thy heavy curse Is lighted on poor Hastings' wretched head.	shakespearean
This is the motley-minded gentleman that I have so often met in the forest.	shakespearean
That is, if we ever want to return to being rivals for Bianca’s love.	modern
Don’t spend any more time here.	modern
It must be so, for miracles are ceased, And therefore we must needs admit the means How things are perfected.	shakespearean
And on their graves, I trust, the story of this day’s work will be written in brass.	modern
And harm is getting close!	modern
But you can’t blame me for her offenses.	modern
But I’m still afraid.	modern
I tell thee, I, that thou hast marred her gown.	shakespearean
I’ll look for some way to leave his service.	modern
He is then a giant to an ape; but then is an ape a doctor to such a man.	shakespearean
O royal Caesar!	shakespearean
And you, good yeoman, Whose limbs were made in England, show us here The mettle of your pasture.	shakespearean

More shouting!	modern
But I shall crave your pardon.	shakespearean
Oh, where have you led me, Egypt?	modern
Even though Birnam Wood really did come to Dunsinane, and I’m fighting a man not of woman born, I’ll fight to the end.	modern
I must confess your offer is the best, And, let your father make her the assurance, She is your own; else, you must pardon me.	shakespearean
What does this mean?	modern

Why are you virtuous?	shakespearean
Shall I know your answer?	shakespearean

Be ’t so.	shakespearean
But listen, Charmian.	modern
As mine eyes opened, I saw their weapons drawn.	shakespearean
Oh, how I love thee!	shakespearean
Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee.	shakespearean
We thought you ought to know about it.	modern
Why do you pity him?	modern
There is none of my uncle’s marks upon you.	shakespearean
He’s not himself because he feels so ashamed.	modern
You make me so happy.	modern
We must preserve our goodwill toward each other and not break into factions again.	modern
Let it appear so.	shakespearean
All this amazement can I qualify When after that the holy rites are ended I’ll tell you largely of fair Hero’s death.	shakespearean
Is ’t far you ride?	shakespearean
So you’ll be hanged at the state’s expense.	modern
I wish the night were here already!	modern

I am th' unhappy subject of these quarrels.	shakespearean
I’ll see no more.	shakespearean
Are you going to get me in trouble?	modern
Come, let me wipe thy face.	shakespearean
What touches us ourself shall be last served.	shakespearean
Your graces are right welcome.	shakespearean
You’re not supposed to get old until you’re wise.	modern

For we will fetters put upon this fear, Which now goes too free-footed.	shakespearean
As soon as you kill Prospero.	modern
I cannot tell wat is dat.	shakespearean
You may think perchance that I think you are in love.	shakespearean
Oh, that’s a good wish!	modern
And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands So by his father lost.	shakespearean
My lord, Mark Antony, Hearing that you prepared for war, acquainted My grievèd ear withal, whereon I begged His pardon for return.	shakespearean

Oh, mighty Caesar!	modern
Let heaven and men and devils tell me to shut me up.	modern
I tell him we shall stay here at the least a month, and he heartily prays some occasion may detain us longer.	shakespearean

There’s not a piece of feather in our host— Good argument, I hope, we will not fly— And time hath worn us into slovenry.	shakespearean
Why would you be so foolish as to beat the moody duke’s favorite champion?	modern
Your father was an extremely moral man, and religious people get odd ideas on their deathbeds.	modern
I’ll bet my life you gave some woman the ring!	modern
Look, he’s moving.	modern
He breathes, my lord.	shakespearean
We will, fair queen, up to the mountain’s top, And mark the musical confusion Of hounds and echo in conjunction.	shakespearean

Tis called the evil.	shakespearean
Well, anyway, goodbye.	modern
When things are at their worst they have to stop, or else improve to the way things were before.	modern
I did very well note him.	shakespearean
But sir— Be quiet, Kent.	modern
How can it be?	modern
You’d better not make that suggestion, Agrippa.	modern
But tell me what you’re fighting about.	modern
He, woman.	shakespearean

Know’st thou Gower?	shakespearean
To this chair bind him.—Villain, thou shalt find— By the kind gods, ’tis most ignobly done To pluck me by the beard.	shakespearean
Antonio, I am married to a wife Which is as dear to me as life itself.	shakespearean
The man hasn’t done anything wrong.	modern
I alone will go.	shakespearean
I sent the king’s son off by himself to a faraway nook on the island, where he’s sitting now sighing, with his arms crossed like this.	modern
Did heaven look on, And would not take their part?	shakespearean
Your wives, your daughters, Your matrons, and your maids could not fill up The cistern of my lust, and my desire All continent impediments would o'erbear That did oppose my will.	shakespearean
How can you blame her, a tender young maiden still given to virgin blushes, for objecting to having a blind, naked boy appear before her?	modern
This just may cheer me up.	modern
Nothing could have subdued nature To such a lowness but his unkind daughters.	shakespearean
Her grapes, which make the wine that cheers our hearts, die unpruned on the vines.	modern

And because I know how fond she is of music, playing her instruments, and poetry, I plan to hire live-in tutors for her.	modern
He did touch on women a bit, but his body was aching with fever and he talked about the Whore of Babylon.	modern
This case of that huge spirit now is cold.	shakespearean
This speed of Caesar’s Carries beyond belief.	shakespearean
But the great one that goes up the hill, let him draw thee after.	shakespearean
Now, my dearest Queen— Please, stand farther away from me.	modern
But when exactly will we see Benedick married?	modern
He goes forth to war bravely.	modern
But better service have I never done you Than now to bid you hold.	shakespearean
Yes, I intend so.	shakespearean
How came these things to pass?	shakespearean
By and by.	shakespearean
I need to get away from you.	modern
Yes, it is apparel.	shakespearean
Come, go in.	shakespearean
In order to flatter Caesar, would you flirt with the servant who laces up his pants?	modern
This, Decius Brutus.	shakespearean
He has to pay the price for his foolish actions.	modern
The selfsame name, but one of better nature.	shakespearean
Music such as charmeth sleep!	shakespearean
The strings, my lord, are false.	shakespearean
I swear, if anyone holds me back, I’ll make a ghost of him!	modern
What kind of life do you lead that your poor friends must beg for your company?	modern
Stop right now!	modern

I am here already, sir.	shakespearean
We hope you feel better and find some peace.	modern
You can have what you want.	modern

Excellent, i' faith, of the chameleon’s dish.	shakespearean
Legged like a man and his fins like arms!	shakespearean
Be convincing.	modern
Come, some music!	shakespearean
To what end, my lord?	shakespearean
Your wife and brother led troops against me, claiming to be fighting in your name.	modern
But don’t expect any more than that.	modern
Yes, Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.	shakespearean
Oh, I am slain!—My lord, you have one eye left To see some mischief on him.	shakespearean
We will meet, and there we may rehearse most obscenely and courageously.	shakespearean
Now, daughter Katherine?	modern
Come inside with me, and I will tell you my plan.	modern
Ho, ho, ho!	shakespearean
Let me shake thy hand.	shakespearean
Friar, it cannot be.	shakespearean
Is your little pearl in there?	modern
Petruchio, go thy ways; the field is won.	shakespearean
This paper tells me of ten thousand Frenchmen who lie dead on the battlefield.	modern
I’ll give you mine.	modern
For, of my heart, those charms, thine eyes, are blotted.	shakespearean
If you poison us, do we not die?	shakespearean
Sir, he should have as many as Caesar has.	modern
What is this same?	shakespearean
Thus bad begins and worse remains behind.	shakespearean
Let’s send this news to Rome.	modern
In some bush?	shakespearean
Reading their mail isn’t as bad.	modern
Before the time I did Lysander see Seemed Athens as a paradise to me.	shakespearean
Oh, come quickly!	modern
Go then, my mother; to thy daughter go.	shakespearean
Don’t cry, don’t cry.	modern
We have to strike while the iron’s hot.	modern
It is to be all made of faith and service, And so am I for Phoebe.	shakespearean
I come to thee for charitable license, That we may wander o'er this bloody field To book our dead and then to bury them; To sort our nobles from our common men, For many of our princes—woe the while!— Lie drowned and soaked in mercenary blood.	shakespearean
Speak, Agrippa.	shakespearean
I’m sweating and trembling with fear.	modern
You were worn with honor.	modern
All the most beautiful paintings Are black when compared to Rosalind.	modern
What shall be our sport, then?	shakespearean
And I pray God grant them a fair departure.	shakespearean
I’m not that stupid.	modern
But I’m afraid we’ll never get him to agree to be king.	modern
The servants, the duke, and your daughter all seem to be treating you less kindly.	modern
Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine Nor age so eat up my invention Nor fortune made such havoc of my means Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends But they shall find, awaked in such a kind, Both strength of limb and policy of mind, Ability in means and choice of friends, To quit me of them throughly.	shakespearean
I have half a mind to hit you before you speak again.	modern
I prithee, turn aside and weep for her.	shakespearean
Fortune pursue thee!	shakespearean
Stanley, pay attention to your wife’s doings.	modern
He hath made me a Christian.	shakespearean
Most noble sir, stand up.	modern
You are an honest man.	modern
Come on, sweet Audrey.	modern
When it is lighted, come and call me here.	shakespearean
Mad call I it, for, to define true madness, What is ’t but to be nothing else but mad?	shakespearean
Poor and content is rich, and rich enough, But riches fineless is as poor as winter To him that ever fears he shall be poor.	shakespearean
Now my charms are all o'erthrown, And what strength I have’s mine own, Which is most faint.	shakespearean
How did you tolerate prison?	modern
Come, my spade.	shakespearean
Oh, no.	modern
Gracious King Edward has sent us noble Siward and ten thousand soldiers.	modern
He only lived long enough to become a man, and as soon as he proved that he was a man by fighting like one, he died.	modern
I am the second son of old Sir Rowland, That bring these tidings to this fair assembly.	shakespearean
What villains did this to you?	modern
Why ask you?	shakespearean
Look at the three little dogs, Tray, Blanch, and Sweetheart—all barking at me.	modern
I fly, Biondello.	shakespearean
And mine, but it grows something stale with me.	shakespearean
Company is coming here.	shakespearean
Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.	shakespearean
God help me!	modern
All hail, great master!	shakespearean
This is a horrible sight.	modern
Hold, for shame!	shakespearean
I could do it easily now.	modern
And the one who commands us is our king.	modern
No, Pompey, I haven’t had anything to drink.	modern
You mock me, madam.	shakespearean
Art thou contented, Jew?	shakespearean
Metellus Cimber?	shakespearean
Do thou meet me presently at the harbor.—Come hither.	shakespearean
So the life that died with shame Lives in death with glorious fame.	shakespearean
Give me some music.	shakespearean
So, by Christ, I’ll cut off your head.	modern
Because, if you must know, she’s been chosen by Signior Gremio.	modern
Foolish girl, in the eyes of most people this man’s a Caliban, and compared to him, they’re angels.	modern
What though I be not so in grace as you— So hung upon with love, so fortunate— But miserable most, to love unloved?	shakespearean
There let him sink, and be the seas on him!	shakespearean
Now, Catesby, what says your lord to my request?	shakespearean
I don’t know what private grudges they had that made them do it.	modern
Yet, forgive me, God, That I do brag thus.	shakespearean
An it had not fallen flat-long.	shakespearean
I never shall endure her.	shakespearean
Upon my sword.	shakespearean
Let heaven and men and devils, let them all, All, all cry shame against me, yet I’ll speak.	shakespearean
Would you like to taste the banquet?	modern
Strike, I say!	shakespearean
Our masquerade mates are waiting for us.	modern
I’ll be gentle and mild.	modern
You’re making fun of me.	modern
But then I saw no harm, and then I heard Each syllable that breath made up between them.	shakespearean
Oh, I wish we could unmask scoundrels like that, and give a whip to every good man to beat them senseless with!	modern
Yes, one, and this is how I did it.	modern
They commanded me to lock my doors and leave you out in this merciless storm, but I’ve come out here to find you and take you where there’s warmth and food.	modern
He is, my lord.	modern
Not very well, but I’ve met him several times.	modern
If thou canst love a fellow of this temper, Kate, whose face is not worth sunburning, that never looks in his glass for love of anything he sees there, let thine eye be thy cook.	shakespearean
Have you done yet?	shakespearean
I cannot tell.	shakespearean
You mean the man who used to be Othello?	modern
And I will purge thy mortal grossness so That thou shalt like an airy spirit go.— Peaseblossom, Cobweb, Moth, and Mustardseed!	shakespearean
He has a very gloomy attitude.	modern
What is ’t thou canst demand?	shakespearean
Well then, I’ll do it.	modern
Let’s not talk about it.	modern
I’m not afraid of dead uncles.	modern
I know how his mind works.	modern
What mean your graces?	shakespearean
Lo, here I lie, Never to rise again.	shakespearean
I had my father’s signet in my purse, Which was the model of that Danish seal.	shakespearean
My dagger, little cousin?	shakespearean
Follow and see to it that nothing serious happens between them.	modern
Calm down.	modern
Sir, your description of him doesn’t detract from his good qualities, though I know that trying to list them all would make your head spin, and even so you wouldn’t be able to keep up with him.	modern
Therefore, you clown, abandon—which is, in the vulgar, “leave”—the society—which in the boorish is “company”—of this female—which in the common is “woman”; which together is, abandon the society of this female, or, clown, thou perishest; or, to thy better understanding, diest; or, to wit, I kill thee, make thee away, translate thy life into death, thy liberty into bondage.	shakespearean
It’s expressly against the rules of combat.	modern
We’re going to have an out-and-out brawl if I stay any longer.	modern
Gracious my lord, I should report that which I say I saw, But know not how to do ’t.	shakespearean
My son will win.	modern
You were sent for.	modern
Your misery will make them sharp and piercing like mine.	modern
Grandam, one night as we did sit at supper, My uncle Rivers talked how I did grow More than my brother: “Ay,” quoth my uncle Gloucester, “Small herbs have grace; great weeds do grow apace.” And since, methinks I would not grow so fast Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste.	shakespearean
Who is it that complains unto the king That I, forsooth, am stern and love them not?	shakespearean
Some bloody passion shakes your very frame.	shakespearean
If I owe you anything, I’ll pay you in clubbings.	modern
He could never bear carnation.	modern
The noble duke my master, My worthy arch and patron, comes tonight.	shakespearean
Will you listen to me, Roderigo?	modern
Look, it’s my dear Lady Disdain!	modern
Pray, chuck, come hither.	shakespearean
I take all responsibility for my decisions.	modern
Live a little, be comforted a little, cheer up a little.	modern
Sir, have pity, I’ll be his surety.	shakespearean
My lord Sebastian, The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness And time to speak it in.	shakespearean
Come, everyone.	modern
Is Fleance going with you?	modern
I am not taught to make anything.	shakespearean
I’ll know his humor when he knows his time.	shakespearean
I hope not, Madam.	modern
Nothing, my lord, or if I did—I don’t know what.	modern
For indeed, who would set his wit to so foolish a bird?	shakespearean
First let me talk with this philosopher.—	shakespearean
Do you go back dismayed?	shakespearean
But did you see them dead?	modern
How hast thou offended?	shakespearean
We’re safe from my father for at least three hours.	modern
Enliven them with yours!	modern
O ye immortal gods!	shakespearean
And so return to you, and nothing else?	shakespearean
Why, then, some be of laughing, as, ah, ha, he!	shakespearean
I hear their drum.	shakespearean
Why looks your grace so heavily today?	shakespearean
Hast thou forgot her?	shakespearean
By so much the more shall I tomorrow be at the height of heart-heaviness, by how much I shall think my brother happy in having what he wishes for.	shakespearean
Tell them that you know that Hero loves me.	shakespearean
Go to her and tell her for me.	modern
Mark Antony heard that you were preparing to wage war on him.	modern
He is worth more mourning than that, and I will mourn for him.	modern
And were the king on ’t, what would I do?	shakespearean
I swear on my soul it was a lie.	modern
Whisper her ear and tell her I and Ursula Walk in the orchard, and our whole discourse Is all of her.	shakespearean
Then, prophetlike, They hailed him father to a line of kings.	shakespearean
Let your wedding be tomorrow.	shakespearean
I’d rather be a weed in a hedge than a rose in my brother’s garden.	modern
It shall be done.	shakespearean
Get somebody strong to carry him out of here.	modern
Are you yet living?	shakespearean
Lay them in gore, Since you have shore With shears his thread of silk.	shakespearean
I heard him groan—yes, I did—and the same tongue that ordered the Romans to obey him and transcribe his speeches in their books cried, “Give me some water, Titinius,” like a sick girl.	modern
You’ve lost your resolve.	modern
I see a woman may be made a fool If she had not a spirit to resist.	shakespearean
The more I try to hide what I’m feeling, the bigger it gets.	modern
I’m glad to hear it.	modern
A very handsome man.	shakespearean
I swear I won’t, sir.	modern
When did she send thee?	shakespearean
The play’s the thing Wherein I’ll catch the conscience of the king.	shakespearean
Of my kind uncle, that I know will give, And being but a toy, which is no grief to give.	shakespearean
Then your hose should be ungartered, your bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe untied, and everything about you demonstrating a careless desolation.	shakespearean
And therefore, like herself—wise, fair and true— Shall she be placèd in my constant soul.	shakespearean
False, false.	shakespearean
With the help of the grim  The first to greet me there was my great	modern
No, he’s not.	modern
I’ll show you how kind I am.	modern
I will tomorrow— And betimes I will—to the weird sisters.	shakespearean
My liege, this was my glove; here is the fellow of it.	shakespearean
And I do think—or else this brain of mine Hunts not the trail of policy so sure As it hath used to do—that I have found The very cause of Hamlet’s lunacy.	shakespearean
You take out your sword too.	modern
Sir and madam, to make grand speeches about what majesty is, what service is, or why day is day, night is night, and time is time is just a waste of a lot of day, night, and time.	modern
All’s well.	shakespearean
His fault is much, and the good king his master Will check him for ’t.	shakespearean
I would she had bestowed this dotage on me.	shakespearean
Should I lie, madam?	shakespearean
By Him that raised me to this careful height From that contented hap which I enjoyed, I never did incense his majesty Against the duke of Clarence, but have been An earnest advocate to plead for him.	shakespearean
Yes, sir.	modern
If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it, And I will break with her and with her father, And thou shalt have her.	shakespearean
O, wilt thou darkling leave me?	shakespearean
Have you both really given me up?	modern
Think you I am no stronger than my sex, Being so fathered and so husbanded?	shakespearean
What do you mean by all this?	modern
There will be a feast from five o'clock until eleven.	modern
Who can stain that name with a just accusation?	modern
Ay, if I be alive and your mind hold and your dinner worth the eating.	shakespearean
If I do find him fit, I’ll move your suit And seek to effect it to my uttermost.	shakespearean
Now, Signior, where’s the Count?	shakespearean
And could you please take my servant to old Shylock’s house?	modern
But goes thy heart with this?	shakespearean
A heavy summons lies like lead upon me, And yet I would not sleep.	shakespearean
My Italy is full of civil war.	modern
O heavens, that such companions thou’dst unfold, And put in every honest hand a whip To lash the rascals naked through the world Even from the east to th' west!	shakespearean
I know he wouldn’t be a wolf if the Romans didn’t act like sheep.	modern
I have been told so of many.	shakespearean
Well, let it strike ten then.	modern
Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.	shakespearean
A gentle riddance.—Draw the curtains, go.— Let all of his complexion choose me so.	shakespearean
Continue, then, and don’t forget to perform all of the rituals.	modern
Fare you well.	shakespearean
Therefore, as I am bound, Receive it from me.	shakespearean
Read thou this challenge.	shakespearean
No, stop.	modern
Which speech, my lord?	modern
Absolutely, if you can find a wife by then.	modern
Please don’t ruin any more trees by carving love poems on their barks.	modern
The duke will drink under this tree.—He’s been looking for you all day, you know.	modern
I’m starting to feel murderous urges.	modern
I dreamed about an emperor called Antony.	modern
My features are still that beautiful—or else you, the greatest soldier in the world, have become the greatest liar by overpraising them.	modern
That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty.	shakespearean
Fair princess, you’ve missed some good sport.	modern
And if on earth he do not merit it, In reason he should never come to heaven.	shakespearean
Sir, such a life with such a wife is unlikely!	modern
Question: why, an hour in clamor and a quarter in rheum.	shakespearean
Farewell the plumèd troops and the big wars That makes ambition virtue!	shakespearean
Go tell the king I want to talk to him for a few minutes.	modern
I see you do not mean to part with her, Or else you like not of my company.	shakespearean
That’s always true.	modern
He’s near death, and Roderigo’s dead already.	modern
If only you had a clearer memory of who you are!	modern
Can no prayers pierce thee?	shakespearean
For my part, I am so attired in wonder I know not what to say.	shakespearean
Follow the noise so far as we have quarter; Let’s see how it will give off.	shakespearean
Tis but a man gone.	shakespearean
Look, when I vow, I weep.	shakespearean
Oh, I’m out of breath from this foolish chase.	modern
If the other two are as loopy as we are, our country’s in bad shape.	modern
If I cut my finger, I shall make bold with you.— Your name, honest gentleman?	shakespearean
Oh, help me, anyone who wants to live long!	modern
Prepare yourselves, generals.	modern
Now is it Rome indeed, and room enough, When there is in it but one only man.	shakespearean
But I’m old now, and suffering has weakened me.	modern
And now I have the boy, I will undo This hateful imperfection of her eyes.	shakespearean
Thou didst it excellent.	shakespearean
I’d swear he wouldn’t leave it behind, or even take it off his finger, for all the money in the world.	modern
If thou doubt it, thou mayst slide from my shoulder to my heel with no greater a run but my head and my neck.	shakespearean
And, being men, bearing the will of Caesar, It will inflame you, it will make you mad.	shakespearean
What do you think you’re doing?	modern
I must be laughed at If or for nothing or a little, I Should say myself offended, and with you Chiefly i’ th’ world; more laughed at, that I should Once name you derogately, when to sound your name It not concerned me.	shakespearean
Don’t follow me.	modern
Upon my power I may dismiss this court, Unless Bellario, a learnèd doctor, Whom I have sent for to determine this, Come here today.	shakespearean
He’s pretty awful in the morning when he’s sobering up, and even worse in the afternoon when he’s drunk.	modern
I only partly believe it, for I’m enthusiastic and resolved to meet all dangers without wavering.	modern
Someone take order Buckingham be brought To Salisbury.	shakespearean
A mature age.	modern
If this uncouth forest yield anything savage, I will either be food for it or bring it for food to thee.	shakespearean
Here is the cap your Worship ordered.	modern
Why, how should she be murdered?	shakespearean
But, my good lord— Wherefore should you do this?	shakespearean
Are you really alive, Stephano?	modern
Well, you temporize with the hours.	shakespearean
If thou hast any sound or use of voice, Speak to me.	shakespearean
As Caesar loved me, I weep for him.	shakespearean
Be bloody, bold, and resolute.	shakespearean
I am locked in one of them.	shakespearean
What is my name?	shakespearean
Try again.	modern
Tut, she’s a lamb, a dove, a fool to him!	shakespearean
That you have wronged me doth appear in this: You have condemned and noted Lucius Pella For taking bribes here of the Sardians, Wherein my letters, praying on his side Because I knew the man, were slighted off.	shakespearean
Pray you, sit down, For now we sit to chat as well as eat.	shakespearean
Dear son, you’re alive!	modern
He’s been gone for nine years and he’s leaving again soon.	modern
Who hath measured the ground?	shakespearean
They have all stomachs.	shakespearean
To be honest, I don’t know why I’m so sad.	modern
The humiliation that the king is suffering now will be revenged thoroughly.	modern
Very well, my lord.	shakespearean
For when rich villains have need of poor ones, poor ones may make what price they will.	shakespearean
Yes, be content, good Touchstone.	modern
With all my heart, I give you that thing which, if you didn’t already have it, I’d try with all my heart to keep from you.	modern
If I don’t answer, perhaps you’ll think I’m accepting the heavy responsibility you foolishly want to impose on me.	modern
But despite all this, your daughters will give you a lot of money—or do I mean pain?—in the coming year.	modern
Polite sir, let me say one thing.	modern
Had I great Juno’s power, The strong-winged Mercury should fetch thee up And set thee by Jove’s side.	shakespearean
No one.	modern
He did, my gracious lord, begin that place, Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified.	shakespearean
Now you’re talking.	modern
It’s like this: as long as a person tells me the truth, even though it means my death, I will listen as though he praised me.	modern
Tell me again, where did you leave those lowlifes?	modern
Seek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet The noble Brutus, thrusting this report Into his ears.	shakespearean
Get thee to a nunnery, go.	shakespearean
For God’s sake, let me hear it.	modern
I’m not a traitor.	modern
He says that for Brutus’s sake he finds himself indebted to us all.	modern
What does a crocodile look like?	modern
We will hear Caesar’s will.	shakespearean
I have ’t.	shakespearean
Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer.	shakespearean
At this very minute an old black ram is having sex with your little white lamb.	modern
Was ’t you that did so oft contrive to kill him?	shakespearean

Witness, you ever-burning lights above, You elements that clip us round about, Witness that here Iago doth give up The execution of his wit, hands, heart, To wronged Othello’s service.	shakespearean
It is, and wants but nomination.	shakespearean
Yet I hate not Orlando.	shakespearean
Horatio says ’tis but our fantasy And will not let belief take hold of him Touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us.	shakespearean
Fie, what a slug is Hastings that he comes not To tell us whether they will come or no!	shakespearean
Yes, my lord?	modern
Listen to my reasons and be silent so you can hear.	modern
The point is that she didn’t write this letter.	modern
The queen and her elves will be here soon.	modern
It is not seen enough; you should wear it in your cap.	shakespearean
Will it not be received, When we have marked with blood those sleepy two Of his own chamber and used their very daggers, That they have done ’t?	shakespearean
Lady Beatrice, have you been crying this entire time?	modern
Now, forward with your tale.—Prithee, stand farther off.	shakespearean
My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul, And all the world was of my father’s mind.	shakespearean
In such a time as this it is not meet That every nice offense should bear his comment.	shakespearean
Truly, the tree yields bad fruit.	shakespearean
If justice cannot tame you, she shall ne'er weigh more reasons in her balance.	shakespearean
I Beyond all limit of what else i' th' world Do love, prize, honor you.	shakespearean
But how is it possible that Prospero’s alive and well and living on this island?	modern
Where dost thou hide thy head?	shakespearean
Greetings, my lady, and may God always be with you.	modern
I overheard him and his plans.	modern
Wherein we saw thee quietly interred, Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws To cast thee up again.	shakespearean
You are a fool.	shakespearean
Dear Kate, you and I cannot be confined within the weak list of a country’s fashion.	shakespearean
Caesar, I never believed in omens, but now they frighten me.	modern
I have no doubt that you love me.	modern
Please don’t be offended that I don’t want to offend you any more.	modern
I should backtrack and begin with how my master, Don John, arranged for the Prince, Claudio, and himself to witness this friendly encounter from the orchard.	modern
All three of them are desperate.	shakespearean
But it’s no treason for an Englishman to cut off a French crown—a head, I mean—and tomorrow the king himself will do some snipping.	modern
If so, you’d be buying them to sell again.	modern
Noble Antony, not sickness should detain me.	shakespearean
If she deny to wed, I’ll crave the day When I shall ask the banns and when be marrièd.	shakespearean
Let me beseech your grace not to do so.	shakespearean
Will we be separated?	modern
And what are you going to do with it?	modern
It’s good you hunted for yourself, sir.	modern
Half-blooded fellow, yes.	shakespearean
No, no, he’s gone.	shakespearean
My worthy lord, Your noble friends do lack you.	shakespearean
I’m serving under him to take advantage of him.	modern
He can’t bear his grief and so he’s losing his mind.	modern
I don’t think so.	modern
Is he not jealous?	shakespearean
You mock an ancient tradition, born of reverence and worn in honor of brave men who have died, and then have the gall not to stand by your words.	modern
What need’st thou run so many mile about When thou mayst tell thy tale the nearest way?	shakespearean
The meantime, lady, I’ll raise the preparation of a war Shall stain your brother.	shakespearean
Give me one,” I said.	modern
My sword will talk for me.	modern
You’re going to make me jealous, Launcelot, if you keep taking my wife into dark corners like this!	modern
Nay, and I will.	shakespearean
I say it is the moon that shines so bright.	shakespearean
Up and down, up and down,  I will lead them up and down.	shakespearean
Nobody I care about more than myself.	modern
Why, a bad action is just a wrong in this world, but when you’ve won the whole world, it’s a wrong in your own world, so you can make it right then.	modern
My lord, please go inside here.	modern
These both put off, a poor petitioner, A care-crazed mother to a many sons, A beauty-waning and distressèd widow, Even in the afternoon of her best days, Made prize and purchase of his wanton eye, Seduced the pitch and height of his degree To base declension and loathed bigamy.	shakespearean
Because if that’s the case, I will tell you a plan that will get rid of your enemy and bring you closer to me.	modern
I am unfit to rule and to be king.	modern
You are unkind, Demetrius.	shakespearean

Nay, I’ll go with thee, cheek by jowl.	shakespearean
Here, madam:     Conster them.	shakespearean
If you see anything else, let me know.	modern
I am sure you are not Launcelot, my boy.	shakespearean
They have a coin in England stamped with the figure of an angel, but that’s just engraved on the surface.	modern
Hear my excuse.	shakespearean
But if you do refuse to marry me, You’ll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd?	shakespearean
Let me see his eyes, That, when I note another man like him, I may avoid him.	shakespearean
Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.	shakespearean
I’ll find you another horse.	modern
I’ll put her on that.	modern
So she may live unscarred of bleeding slaughter, I will confess she was not Edward’s daughter.	shakespearean
Come, boy.	shakespearean
Bless thy five wits.	shakespearean
You’re right, that’s how it is.	modern
There are rats and thieves and pirates—not to mention storms, winds, and rocks.	modern
May God in His mercy forgive you.	modern
I’m amazed you got here before me.	modern
Her father’s brother Would be her lord?	shakespearean
Excellent good.	shakespearean
And he did.	modern
I can tell your Majesty, the duke is a brave man.	modern
I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.	shakespearean
I’ve changed my mind now and partly believe in omens.	modern
No, not so, villain, thou beliest thyself.	shakespearean
And can you by no drift of conference Get from him why he puts on this confusion, Grating so harshly all his days of quiet With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?	shakespearean
You’re a hardworking villain who’d do anything his evil mistress wanted him to.	modern
But yet do I believe The origin and commencement of his grief Sprung from neglected love.—How now, Ophelia?	shakespearean
Yes, do that.	modern

He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.	shakespearean
Goodman Verges, sir, speaks a little off the matter.	shakespearean
But, hark, I hear the footing of a man.	shakespearean
Three thousand ducats, well.	shakespearean
Go you, call hither my fool.	shakespearean
Clarence is still alive; Edward is not only alive, he’s king.	modern
Queen Margaret saw your sword steaming with his blood.	modern
But if I gave my wife a handkerchief— Then what?	modern
Well, Brutus, you’re noble.	modern
My lord, this bill that’s being proposed is the same one that was proposed in the eleventh year of old King Henry’s reign.	modern
That’s already been done, sir.	modern
Let it be so.	shakespearean
Your lily-white lips, your cherry-red nose, and your buttercup-yellow cheeks are gone, gone forever.	modern
That was me, but it’s not me— I’m not ashamed to tell you what I once was, since I’m so happy to have since converted.	modern
Don’t worry, sir.	modern
It’s all over now, and so am I.  Let’s forgive each other.	modern
You’ll take the mustard or you’ll get no beef from Grumio.	modern
I am resolved—to let him live.	modern
In a time like this, it doesn’t make sense to criticize every offense.	modern
Look where it comes again!	shakespearean
But in your daughter’s womb I will bury them.	modern
So you’re around Lady Luck’s waist?	modern
By our Lady, I think that’s true.	modern
I won’t have any of this.	modern
His spirits hear me And yet I needs must curse.	shakespearean
Good morrow to this fair assembly.	shakespearean
That blind head of yours was created to make me rich.	modern
Listen, listen!	modern
If that will not suffice, I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er, On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart.	shakespearean
Take good care of him.	modern
Thank you, Tubal.	modern
Well, my good fellows, wait on me tonight.	shakespearean
Interrupt the monster one word further, and, by this hand, I’ll turn my mercy out o' doors and make a stockfish of thee.	shakespearean
He is married?	shakespearean
I can stand well enough, and I speak well enough.	shakespearean
When we have matched our rackets to these balls, We will in France, by God’s grace, play a set Shall strike his father’s crown into the hazard.	shakespearean
Out o' your wits and hearing too?	shakespearean
Aren’t you my father?	modern
That’s my fear.	shakespearean
Your stockings should be falling down around your ankles, your hat flying off your head, your sleeves unbuttoned, your shoes untied, and everything about you demonstrating carelessness and misery.	modern
Go home!	modern
Bad times?	modern
Not sad, my lord.	shakespearean
Of course, sir.	modern
Now all is well.	shakespearean
Yes, I think that’s true.	modern
The captain—give it to the captain.	modern
As I came down?	modern
Foul shame upon you, you have all moved mine.	shakespearean
The messengers!	shakespearean
The gods defend him from so great a shame!	shakespearean
I am out of all other tune, methinks.	shakespearean

Tell us how it happened, noble Casca.	modern
Will you have me?	modern
And like mine, but I’m getting a little tired of it.	modern
No, no, they would not.	shakespearean
I dare make his answer, none.	shakespearean
Nay, but Beatrice— Sweet Hero, she is wronged, she is slandered, she is undone.	shakespearean
I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren.	shakespearean
Oh, it’s horrible, horrible, so horrible!	modern
Why, then, tomorrow I cannot serve your turn for Rosalind?	shakespearean
Don’t be disturbed by my illness.	modern
Yet ’tis the plague to great ones, Prerogatived are they less than the base.	shakespearean
O, know, my name is lost.	shakespearean
Thou shalt be whipped with wire and stewed in brine, Smarting in ling’ring pickle!	shakespearean
Come, come, hurry up.	modern
Like an invitation.	modern
Sometime a horse I’ll be, sometime a hound, A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire.	shakespearean
Let’s have one, good soldier.	modern
One inch of delay more is a South Sea of discovery.	shakespearean
Please be quiet.	modern
She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband.	shakespearean
You should know I’ve earned a thousand gold pieces from Don John.	modern
I’ll recite a prophecy before I go.	modern
You are i' the right, sir, ’tis for my mistress.	shakespearean

The wager thou hast won, and I will add Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns, Another dowry to another daughter, For she is changed as she had never been.	shakespearean
Ay, my lord.	shakespearean
Then may your daughters be cursed with all the horrible fates that await sinners!	modern
Husbands need to know that their wives are human beings too.	modern
What horrible thing are you imagining?	modern
What are you  Nothing.	modern
But you’re lying out in the cold.	modern
I fear thee not.	shakespearean
Then know that from my soul I love thy daughter.	shakespearean
Away with us to Athens.	shakespearean
I have.	modern
Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.	shakespearean
Stay here, Titinius.	modern
I know, sir, I am no flatterer.	shakespearean
Get out of here, you horrible ghost, you hallucination.	modern
I’m the king himself.	modern
Make haste.	shakespearean
They did want me to tell her, but I persuaded them that, if they truly loved Benedick, they would try to get him to battle his emotions and keep Beatrice in the dark.	modern
Well, keep me company but two years more, Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.	shakespearean
I hate it when I hear a blustery actor in a wig tear a passion to shreds, bursting everyone’s eardrums so as to impress the audience on the lower levels of the playhouse, who for the most part can only appreciate loud noises and pantomime shows.	modern
Isn’t today the day when Hermia has to tell us her decision about whether she’ll marry Demetrius?	modern
And how did she react to all this?	modern
How low we can fall, Horatio.	modern
Dost thou not suspect my years?	shakespearean

Tis bitter cold, And I am sick at heart.	shakespearean
There is no better one on earth.	modern
But here’s a paper with Caesar’s seal on it.	modern
My young remembrance cannot parallel A fellow to it.	shakespearean

How did he get such an idea?	modern
Decius, go tell them that Caesar won’t come.	modern
This land will belong to your and Albany’s children forever.—And now what does my second daughter Regan, the wife of Cornwall, have to say?	modern
We’ll rise and leave early tomorrow.	modern

The words expressly are “a pound of flesh.” Take then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh, But in the cutting it if thou dost shed One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods Are by the laws of Venice confiscate Unto the state of Venice.	shakespearean
Tell me so I can be sure, though I swear I recognize your voice.	modern
Don’t be afraid.	modern
Good time of day unto my gracious lord.	shakespearean

Your eyes look like they’ve sunk into your head.	modern
So go and put your stamp on the girl.	modern
Tell me, please: how many boys and girls will I have?	modern
You dog, you peasant!	modern
With any strong or vehement importunity.	shakespearean

But go on.	modern
I’ll rather dwell in my necessity.	shakespearean
Where is that viper?	shakespearean
What was he that you followed with your sword?	shakespearean
My most dear lord!	shakespearean
I am glad to see your highness.	shakespearean
What is it?	modern
I’ll warrant she’ll tax him home.	shakespearean

This way will I. Disrobe the images If you do find them decked with ceremonies.	shakespearean
Prepare you, generals.	shakespearean
He and I will make up.	modern
After you, my lords?	modern
Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose.	shakespearean
Ay, for the state, not for Antonio.	shakespearean
What, man, there are ways to recover the general again.	shakespearean
Two or three of us have seen strange things.	modern
I will see them.	modern
If we are slated to die, the fewer, the better for our country, and if we’re slated to live, the fewer men, the greater the share of honor for each of us.	modern
Tranio, I saw her coral-pink lips move and perfume the air with her breath.	modern
Fetch that gallant hither.	shakespearean
I am sorry.	shakespearean
Curse you for your false appearances!	modern

Are you sad about that?	modern
I hope luck will give me what my heart hopes for!	modern

We do not know.	shakespearean
Fair daylight?	shakespearean
There, My music playing far off, I will betray Tawny-finned fishes.	shakespearean

Yet, coming from him, that great med’cine hath With his tinct gilded thee.	shakespearean
I would have daffed all other respects and made her half myself.	shakespearean
I know the boy will be a convincing gentlewoman, taking up her exact walk and talk and gentle gestures.	modern
Yes, noble lord.	modern
If you do love Rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries it out, when your brother marries Aliena shall you marry her.	shakespearean
The enemy gets larger each day.	modern
What, all so soon asleep?	shakespearean
I would have met you by sea and again by land.	modern
But let me try my luck on the boxes.	modern
Is thy name Tyrrel?	shakespearean
You thought about it too long, considering what you found there.	modern
Will you cry?	modern
For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.	shakespearean

We charge you, in the Prince’s name, to stop!	modern
Sorry, sir?	modern
Is this servant of yours a smart man?	modern
Not me.	modern
Mistress and master, you’ve often asked about that lovelorn shepherd you once saw me sitting with, the one who complained about the disdainful shepherdess he was in love with.	modern
I remember kissing her washing stick and the cow’s udders that her pretty, chapped hands had milked.	modern
There she is, over there.	modern
I now perceive it was not altogether your brother’s evil disposition made him seek his death, but a provoking merit set awork by a reprovable badness in himself.	shakespearean
Let this solemn melody comfort your fevered minds, which are now useless, seething inside your skulls.—All of you stand there in my spell.—	modern
I had to hurry to my love, beautiful Helena, who lights up the night better than all those fiery stars.	modern

My dear lord, you know how passionately stubborn the duke is.	modern
Good Enobarbus, you would be doing a very good thing if you advised your captain to speak calmly and quietly.	modern
Shall I do such a deed?	shakespearean
What have I said in my grief?	modern
To plainness honor’s bound When majesty falls to folly.	shakespearean
Sir, will you, with those infirmities she owes— Unfriended, new adopted to our hate, Dowered with our curse and strangered with our oath— Take her or leave her?	shakespearean
What, are they children?	shakespearean
Bear thee well in it and leave us alone.	shakespearean
Why, no, boy.	modern
Oh, ’twas a din to fright a monster’s ear, To make an earthquake!	shakespearean
Could the lead one contain it?	modern
Oh, how I love you!	modern
I know exactly how to proceed.	modern
She is of so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition, she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested.	shakespearean
And if he ever has a wife, let her be more miserable when he dies than I am now.	modern
And I swear to God he’s very smart.	modern
This I’ll report, dear lady.	shakespearean
And I think she’s at least thirty.	modern
I didn’t hear anything.	modern
What, will you not suffer me?	shakespearean
Dorset is fled to Richmond.	shakespearean
Let me shake your hand.	modern
Would it were day!	shakespearean
Wouldst thou have that Which thou esteem’st the ornament of life, And live a coward in thine own esteem, Letting “I dare not” wait upon “I would, ” Like the poor cat i' th' adage?	shakespearean
Nor no one here, for curses never pass The lips of those that breathe them in the air.	shakespearean
The cause is in my will.	shakespearean
Do you know him?	modern
Lily-livered coward, what’s he doing there?	modern
Marry, th' athversary was have possession of the pridge, but he is enforced to retire, and the duke of Exeter is master of the pridge.	shakespearean
But don’t do that.	modern
The royal tree hath left us royal fruit, Which, mellowed by the stealing hours of time, Will well become the seat of majesty, And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.	shakespearean
I’m surprised I didn’t bite back.	modern
Our son shall win.	shakespearean
Margaret, run into the sitting room.	modern
Oh, villainous!	shakespearean
Please find a way to give me some time alone with Desdemona, if you think that’s all right.	modern
Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.	shakespearean
I know his heart.	shakespearean
I’m speechless.	modern
I’m sure you aren’t Launcelot, my boy.	modern
Let him alone awhile.	shakespearean
But who is that?	modern
You’re as wise as you are beautiful.	modern
Many of you own slaves, which—like your donkeys and dogs and mules—you use to perform awful jobs just because you bought them.	modern
I knew you’d turn out this way.	modern
Time will tell what you’ve got up your sleeve.	modern
Then say they were not slain.	shakespearean
All things shall be well.	shakespearean
Or was it just your whim, on your own initiative?	modern
Sir, I’m upset.	modern
Had I plantation of this isle, my lord— He’d sow ’t with nettle seed.	shakespearean
My best endeavours shall be done herein.	shakespearean
Listen to the noble Antony.	modern
Haven’t I resisted even Brutus, begging from his knees?	modern
Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord, When men are unprepared and look not for it.	shakespearean
What dost thou think?	shakespearean
And after that he came back here looking so serious?	modern
I will leave you now to your gossip-like humor.	shakespearean
Before your sentence has been completed?	modern
Not so happy, yet much happier.	shakespearean
Scratch my head, Peaseblossom.	modern
All myself?	shakespearean
All men I hope live so.	shakespearean
He is addressed.	shakespearean
Please tell him I have surrendered to his fortune.	modern
Until her beautiful life’s end.	modern
Pull only his name out of his heart and let him go.	modern
More or less.	modern
No shame but mine.	shakespearean
I can’t say “whore.” It makes me sick to say the word even now.	modern
Madam, you must come to your uncle.	shakespearean
The heavens only announce the deaths of princes.	modern
You wouldn’t have dared to tempt him so.	modern
That was nothing.	modern
Good-bye to you, the last of all the Romans.	modern
A person can only pay with their life once, and she has paid in full.	modern
But I will wed thee in another key, With pomp, with triumph, and with reveling.	shakespearean
The terms of our estate may not endure Hazard so dangerous as doth hourly grow Out of his lunacies.	shakespearean
I should be ridiculed if I were offended so easily—and laughed at even more for speaking of you disrespectfully, when I had no reason to speak of you at all.	modern
Let us now stay and see it.	shakespearean
If I died right now I’d be completely happy, since I’ll probably never be as happy as this again in my life.	modern
Give ’s your hand.	shakespearean
Go take this shape And hither come in ’t.	shakespearean
Why, all our ranks are broke.	shakespearean
What sayst thou to me now?	shakespearean
What do you want with her, sir?	modern
The  I thank you.	shakespearean
I just meant that our hearts are joined, so we can almost think of them as one heart.	modern
If I didn’t have a good reason to do this, damn me to the very bottom of hell.	modern
But it is no matter.	shakespearean
She was worried about my absence, and about the fact that young Octavius and Mark Antony have grown so strong—which I found out at the same time as the news of her death.	modern
Get out of my sight.	modern
Bring me no more reports.	shakespearean
My lord, the army of great Buckingham— Out on you, owls!	shakespearean
You may have lost his respect, but so have I.	modern
You may as well try to turn the sun to ice by fanning its face with a peacock feather.	modern
Cousin, thou wast not wont to be so dull.	shakespearean
Fill my cup, Lucius, until the wine overflows it.	modern
With my eye sockets?	modern
You shall not stir out of your house today.	shakespearean
Three of the carriages are very imaginatively designed, and they match the fencing accessories.	modern
You touched my vein at first.	shakespearean
What do you think will be the result of this storm?	modern
The prince of Arragon has taken his oath, and he’s coming to make his choice now.	modern
And in part him, but,” you may say, “not well.	shakespearean
Lead away.	shakespearean
This is the sergeant Who like a good and hardy soldier fought 'Gainst my captivity.	shakespearean
How chances it they travel?	shakespearean
Not a mouse stirring.	shakespearean
Nothing, unless you render her again.	shakespearean
The love that follows us sometime is our trouble, Which still we thank as love.	shakespearean
With those plays in mind, we hope you’ll receive this one kindly.	modern
Mine, neither.	modern
My father—methinks I see my father.	shakespearean
I knew there would be a masquerade when I got that bad omen of a bloody nose last Easter Monday, at six in the morning, four years after I got the same kind of bloody nose on Ash Wednesday, in the afternoon.	modern
Then wherefore should I doubt?	shakespearean
I’ll give you cramps for saying that—horrible pains in your sides that will keep you from breathing.	modern
Your whole family will be ruined.	modern
Their guilt is finally starting to gnaw at them, like a slow-acting poison.	modern
An honest guy who’s as poor as the king.	modern
I repent me much That so I harried him.	shakespearean
Give me Bianca for my inheritance.	modern
Iago beckons me.	shakespearean
Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours, Makes the night morning, and the noontide night.	shakespearean
All right.	modern
Marry, that he had received a thousand ducats of Don John for accusing the Lady Hero wrongfully.	shakespearean
Tis now struck twelve.	shakespearean
Nay, good my fellows, do not please sharp fate To grace it with your sorrows.	shakespearean
Leave her to God and her own guilt.	modern
Stay invisible.	modern
Luck and Antony separate here and now.	modern
Now, if you love me, stay.	shakespearean
I don’t want her.	modern
Her father loved me and used to invite me to his house often, continually asking me about my life and all the battles I’ve fought.	modern
I’ve lurked in the shadows here to watch the downfall of my enemies.	modern
If you could only hear this testament—which, excuse me, I don’t intend to read aloud—you would kiss dead Caesar’s wounds and dip your handkerchiefs in his sacred blood, and beg for a lock of hair to remember him by.	modern
Our separated fortune Shall keep us both the safer.	shakespearean
Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.	shakespearean
Let’s follow it, and after do our work.	shakespearean
No, I warrant your Grace you shall not entreat him to a second, that have so mightily persuaded him from a first.	shakespearean
Don’t try to find out more.	modern
So be quiet.	modern
I pray thee, let us go and find him out And quicken his embracèd heaviness With some delight or other.	shakespearean
And so I am, I am.	shakespearean
Then, to answer every man briefly, wisely, and truthfully—wisely I say, I am a bachelor.	modern
Two of them are completely honorable, and if they have been tricked in this, we must blame John the Bastard, who lives to create conflict.	modern
Her name is Katherina Minola, famous throughout Padua for her scolding tongue.	modern
It’s a miracle you’re alive.	modern
Or be alive again, And dare me to the desert with thy sword.	shakespearean
O, reform it altogether!	shakespearean
Well, brighter lights always dim the smaller ones.	modern
No, I will not.	shakespearean
You are passing welcome, And so I pray you all to think yourselves.	shakespearean
I cannot find it.	shakespearean
Shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly.	shakespearean
And if your love can produce something from its sadness, write a poem for her; hang it on her grave and sing it to her bones.	modern
I thank thee, Ariel.	shakespearean
I’ll see her like this.	modern
Gremio, ’tis now no time to vent our love.	shakespearean
She deserves to have rocks and stones thrown on her body.	modern
I never saw it or suspected it, so it never hurt me.	modern
And that’s how my brother robbed me of my life, my crown, and my queen all at once.	modern
How will I recognize you in the future?	modern
But I bet Fortinbras will win the election to the Danish crown.	modern
As for the food, it will be served in covered dishes.	modern
And though we lay these honors on this man To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads, He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold, To groan and sweat under the business, Either led or driven, as we point the way.	shakespearean
When Duke Frederick heard that great, worthy men were coming to this forest every day, he raised a large army to invade this land and fight his brother.	modern
The revelers are entering, brother.	shakespearean

Give me your hand, Messala.	modern
He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at the mouth and was speechless.	modern
How, the nonpareil!	shakespearean
Sit down, worthy friends.	modern
It is the most impenetrable cur That ever kept with men.	shakespearean
No, I don’t, my lord.	modern
Or any of your faction?	shakespearean
So shines a good deed in a naughty world.	shakespearean
Someday you can get revenge.—Oh, you bastard!	modern
Think on thy sins.	shakespearean
Don’t deceive me.	modern
No Duke of spineless Burgundy can take this treasure of a girl from me now.—Say goodbye to them, Cordelia, even though they’ve been unkind to you.	modern
What is the matter?	shakespearean
It’s not good for your health, either.	modern
Oh, yet I do repent me of my fury, That I did kill them.	shakespearean
Sweet remembrancer!	shakespearean
I’ll poison you, or beat you with a club, or stab you with a sword.	modern
So she was moved by it?	modern
Fortinbras swore never to threaten Denmark again.	modern
You can’t have anything but the penalty, to be taken at your peril, Jew.	modern
Come on, I’ll escort you to dinner.	modern
Braved in mine own house with a skein of thread?	shakespearean
Stand and fight, you overdressed servant, fight!	modern

We’ll figure out the best time and safest route to avoid being found out by my father’s guards, whom he’ll send out as soon as he discovers I’ve gone.	modern
Even since you left it.	shakespearean
Absolutely—so long as he gets the girl.	modern
But I have a legitimate son a few years older than this one, and I don’t love him any more than I love my bastard.	modern
No lady could be more miserable than I if you two disagree.	modern
What’s he talking about?	modern
But look to it: Find out thy brother, wheresoe'er he is.	shakespearean
Or at least I can describe the rumors.	modern
It is not courteous, you know, to assume you know my meaning before I’ve finished talking.	modern
At night we’ll feast together.	shakespearean
Into a thousand that I have forgotten.	shakespearean
Yes, let her die and rot and go to hell tonight.	modern
Sorry, sir, Goodman Verges tends to ramble.	modern

Away, away, for he is coming hither!	shakespearean
She shows a body rather than a life, A statue than a breather.	shakespearean
I would I were, to be revenged on thee.	shakespearean
The king rode out alone to view their troops.	modern
My lord approaches.	shakespearean
What man is that?	shakespearean
Oh, then we bring forth weeds When our quick minds lie still, and our ills told us Is as our earing.	shakespearean

No, as I shall be saved.	shakespearean
Hold you, there is a groat to heal your pate.	shakespearean
Come hither, fellow.	shakespearean
It is but change, Titinius, for Octavius Is overthrown by noble Brutus' power, As Cassius' legions are by Antony.	shakespearean

Dost thou love pictures?	shakespearean
I’m glad to see you.	modern
Still am I called.—Unhand me, gentlemen.	shakespearean
All of us have cause To wail the dimming of our shining star, But none can help our harms by wailing them.— Madam, my mother, I do cry you mercy; I did not see your Grace.	shakespearean
Be patient, your highness.	modern
I never saw a better-fashioned gown, More quaint, more pleasing, nor more commendable.	shakespearean
We’ll have celebration feasts for each other before we go our separate ways.	modern
Calphurnia’s cheek is pale, and Cicero Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes As we have seen him in the Capitol Being crossed in conference by some senators.	shakespearean
Thy loving father, Hamlet.	shakespearean
I’m telling you all this out of affection for you, so you can either keep him from carrying out his plans or prepare to accept his disgrace, which will be his own fault, not mine.	modern
This I made good to you In our last conference, passed in probation with you, How you were borne in hand, how crossed, the instruments, Who wrought with them, and all things else that might To half a soul and to a notion crazed Say, “Thus did Banquo.”      You made it known to us.	shakespearean
We’ll win yet.	modern
The king wants to speak with Cornwall.	modern
Let me entreat you.	shakespearean
Nay, I prithee stay a little.	shakespearean
This dream is all amiss interpreted.	shakespearean
I hope, for my brother’s justification, he wrote this but as an essay or taste of my virtue.	shakespearean
Then, world, thou hast a pair of chaps, no more, And throw between them all the food thou hast, They’ll grind the one the other.	shakespearean
And thus I let you go and give you to the gods.	modern
Sorrow interrupts all hours and seasons.	modern
I never felt it until now—two thousand ducats in that diamond, and other precious, precious jewels!	modern
Oh, that arrow was well shot.	modern
So please my lord the duke and all the court, To quit the fine for one half of his goods I am content, so he will let me have The other half in use to render it Upon his death unto the gentleman That lately stole his daughter.	shakespearean
Come on, Balthasar, let’s hear that song again.	modern
But my eyes, which I’ve darted at you, haven’t even left a mark.	modern
I do not like the Tower, of any place.— Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?	shakespearean
I shall do’t, my lord.	shakespearean
I think he got his jacket in Italy, his tights in France, his hat in Germany, and his behavior everywhere.	modern
Ay, are you thereabouts?	shakespearean
No, they’re busy and as excellent as ever.	modern
And all because I use my own money to make a profit.	modern
Tell me, Captain Macmorris, have you left the tunnels?	modern
It is now high suppertime, and the night grows to waste.	shakespearean
Wonder not till further warrant.	shakespearean
You’ll “never trust his word again.” Come on, that was a stupid thing to say.	modern
I have spoke thus much To mitigate the justice of thy plea, Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.	shakespearean
Be factious for redress of all these griefs, And I will set this foot of mine as far As who goes farthest.	shakespearean
I am he that is so love-shaked.	shakespearean
Thou’dst thank me but a little for my counsel; And yet I’ll promise thee she shall be rich, And very rich.	shakespearean
Bid them come near.	shakespearean
Ay, be so, good Touchstone.	shakespearean
Two of my brother’s men, all tied up!	modern
Give me your hand, first.	modern
O, you are novices!	shakespearean
Peter, did you ever see anything like it?	modern
Wife, children, servants, all that could be found.	shakespearean
Oh, rare for Antony!	shakespearean
Will you come presently?	shakespearean
No one’s life should have been entrusted to them.	modern
Are you going to watch the race?	modern
Tell him I want to speak with him.	modern
No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive Our bosom interest: go pronounce his present death, And with his former title greet Macbeth.	shakespearean
I did not see him since.	shakespearean
Are they good?	shakespearean
If they have spoken the truth about Hero, I will tear her apart with my bare hands.	modern
If Hamlet makes the first or second hit, or gets back at Laertes by making the third hit, then let my soldiers give him a military salute.	modern
Be not afraid.	shakespearean
For they were parted With foul and violent tempest.	shakespearean
No, a whole share for me.	modern
Who wishes that?	modern
Did you accompany Caesar home?	modern
Then in my tent, Cassius, enlarge your griefs, And I will give you audience.	shakespearean
Good night, Pompey.	modern
Because I would not see thy cruèl nails Pluck out his poor old eyes, nor thy fierce sister In his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs.	shakespearean
A whole one, I.	shakespearean
That’s the way great men ought to endure great losses.	modern
Can she give that away too?	modern
If his cause be wrong, our obedience to the king wipes the crime of it out of us.	shakespearean
Murellus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs off Caesar’s images, are put to silence.	shakespearean
Is not the leaf turned down Where I left reading?	shakespearean
Maybe I’ll never go home again, Iago!	modern
Hide it in smiles and affability.	shakespearean
Madam, you have to go to your uncle’s.	modern
Hark, hark!	shakespearean
I’ve fought my way through obstacles twenty times more terrifying than you with this weapon.	modern
Cassio knows you not.	shakespearean
She gives it out that you shall marry her.	shakespearean
No you haven’t, cousin.	modern
Because of me?	modern
I’ll bet my life that he only wrote this letter to gauge my love for you, and for no other reason.	modern
Lady, amen.	shakespearean
Tis pity of him.	shakespearean
Even as a flatt'ring dream or worthless fancy.	shakespearean
I pause for a reply.	shakespearean
I’ll take the Queen into my custody.	modern
He started it, my noble lord, and succeeding generations rebuilt it.	modern
In spite of your heart, I think.	shakespearean
Oh, goodbye!	modern
And in good time here comes the sweating lord.	shakespearean
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff.	shakespearean
His daughters want to kill him.	modern
For you know, nuncle, The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long, That it’s had it head bit off by it young.	shakespearean
When I spoke that, I was ill-tempered too.	shakespearean
Why, I will see thee at Philippi, then.	shakespearean
Now I am sure that eyes can’t hurt a person.	modern
The “why” is plain as way to parish church: He that a fool doth very wisely hit Doth very foolishly, although he smart, Not to seem senseless of the bob.	shakespearean
Hello, sir.	modern
Witless else her son.	shakespearean
Some of my shame, if you will know of me What man I am, and how, and why, and where This handkercher was stained.	shakespearean
You couldn’t find out anything about them?	modern
Faith, some certain dregs of conscience are yet within me.	shakespearean
Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat.	shakespearean
Normans, but bastard Normans, Norman bastards!	shakespearean
So be calm.	modern
She well instructs me.	shakespearean
You defend yourself by blaming my judgment, but you’re just making up feeble excuses.	modern
Come on, let me wipe your face.	modern
Oh, please don’t swear, my lord of Buckingham.	modern
Why Dover?	modern
I’ll mend it and then play— Where’s the Queen?	shakespearean
No, if you struggle with me— Just half an hour!	modern
Only for poor men?	modern
There, take it all back—plates, cups, the whole thing.	modern
All’s cheerless, dark, and deadly.	shakespearean
John Duke of Norfolk and Thomas Earl of Surrey will lead the horsemen and foot soldiers.	modern
I can stay with Regan, I and my hundred knights.	shakespearean
How if I answer “No”?	shakespearean
Dry up in her the organs of increase, And from her derogate body never spring A babe to honor her.	shakespearean
Thou dost see I eat.	shakespearean
You have astonished him.	shakespearean
Who were you chasing with your sword?	modern
But if you would be willing to accept circumstantial evidence as proof, we can get that.	modern
Of a snail?	shakespearean
I doubt not that, since we are well-persuaded We carry not a heart with us from hence That grows not in a fair consent with ours, Nor leave not one behind that doth not wish Success and conquest to attend on us.	shakespearean
Vouchsafe to wear this ring.	shakespearean
Yes, you would beg, if you were in my position.	modern
Longer, longer.	shakespearean
May God thank you for it.	modern
So then the Poles won’t be willing to defend it.	modern
But next day I told him of myself, which was as much As to have asked him pardon.	shakespearean
They cannot budge till your release.	shakespearean
Another Hero!	shakespearean
What crimes have you committed to be sent here to this prison?	modern
How now, cousin Hero!	shakespearean
To have seen much but own nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands.	modern
Examine them yourselves, then bring me your findings.	modern
I thank you for that quip, good Tranio.	modern
Good God, I was about to say something.	modern
If the job had been painful, I would not have come.	modern
It’s been proven that Lady Hero is innocent, that the Prince and Claudio have been utterly deceived, and that Don John—who has run away—is the source of all the trouble.	modern
Let me work.	shakespearean
However, this is an extreme situation, and it’s more important to control it than to worry about how you’ll look.	modern
Is he come?	shakespearean
Oh, how strange!	modern
It’s a lucky sign, isn’t it?	modern
Grumio gave order how it should be done.	shakespearean
What in the world made you risk your reputation like this and become a street brawler?	modern
Why, then All Souls' Day is my body’s doomsday.	shakespearean
By heaven, that should be my handkerchief!	shakespearean
Dear friends, let’s go to bed.	modern
Think you to walk forth?	shakespearean
How should that be?	shakespearean
I don’t believe it.	modern
Th' abuse of greatness is when it disjoins Remorse from power.	shakespearean
Mine was not bridled.	shakespearean
Should I go convince my daughter to marry you?	modern
My Lord of Cambridge and my good Lord of Masham and you, my noble knight, what do you think?	modern
Let’s go inside.	modern
My children too?	shakespearean
My granddaughter, with her kind aunt, the duchess of Gloucester, leading her by the hand?	modern
Gentle gods in heaven, please let me die.	modern
They know by those measurements if there will be famine or plenty.	modern
Find you out a bed, For I upon this bank will rest my head.	shakespearean
That was a poor unlucky beggar.	modern
Why, shall we turn to men?	shakespearean
Oh, it’s too bad!	modern
Yours, Claudio, yours, I say.	modern
I have full cause of weeping, but this heart Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws, Or ere I’ll weep.—O Fool, I shall go mad!	shakespearean
They plan to spend the night in Sardis.	modern
Most noble Empress, you have heard of me?	shakespearean
I cry thee mercy, then, for I did think That thou hadst called me all these bitter names.	shakespearean
What’s going on, Othello, darling?	modern
Oh, quick, or I am gone.	shakespearean
Which be the malefactors?	shakespearean
How goes it now?	shakespearean
What is it that you would impart to me?	shakespearean
I will say so.	shakespearean
Then please tell me he’s all right.	modern
It waves me forth again.	shakespearean
Look, she’s spotted him with those sweet eyes of hers.	modern
Listen Tranio!	modern
And I must Rid all the sea of pirates, then, to send Measures of wheat to Rome.	shakespearean
Go to, go to.—Come hither, sir.	shakespearean
My lord, good morrow.	shakespearean
Madam, if I do as well as I think I’m going to do in these dangerous, violent wars, you and your relatives will have more good at my hands than you’ve ever had bad!	modern
You should let others take care of you and submit to people who know better than you do what’s good for you.	modern
Tell me what you did with the king’s ship, the sailors, and the other ships.	modern
Say “a day” without the “ever.” No, no, Orlando, men are April when they woo, December when they wed. Maids are May when they are maids, but the sky changes when they are wives.	shakespearean
Lord,” he calls you?	modern
You cram these words into mine ears against The stomach of my sense.	shakespearean
What say you, Hermia?	shakespearean
Tyrrel, come back shortly after dinner and tell me the details of their deaths.	modern
A nice coincidence, my lord.	modern
And  I feel that I love her.	modern
Shall we call in the ambassador, my liege?	modern
Pompey, you cannot frighten us with your navy.	modern
And let no one suffer for this deed except us, the perpetrators.	modern
Who could be out of things to say if he were with the girl he loves?	modern
Lovely Beatrice, I thank you for taking the pains to tell me that.	modern
It is so too.	shakespearean
Bear welcome in your eye, Your hand, your tongue.	shakespearean
But in this way, grief and comfort appear together.	modern
She’s dead too, our sovereign.	shakespearean
My lord of Gloucester hath conveyed him hence.	shakespearean
The foul fiend bites my back.	shakespearean
And for my sister and her princely sons, Be satisfied, dear God, with our true blood, Which, as thou know’st, unjustly must be spilt.	shakespearean
On the platform where we stand guard, sir.	modern
Now lies he there, And none so poor to do him reverence.	shakespearean
No medicine in the world can cure you.	modern
I swear, I think my wife’s faithful, and I think she’s not.	modern
By this kind of chase I should hate him, for my father hated his father dearly.	shakespearean
May she give that?	shakespearean
It is better to be tricked completely than to only suspect a little.	modern
These be the Christian husbands.	shakespearean
No, let me not.	shakespearean
Wasn’t he friends with all those brawling knights who serve my father?	modern
Some of those lines had more feet than the  That’s not a problem: the feet can bear Sure, but these feet were	modern
It wants you to go off with it, as if it wants to tell you something alone.	modern
Eros, send his treasure to him.	modern
tis a lost fear.	shakespearean
She can’t stand to hear about getting a husband.	modern
But how is it possible that you still remember this, through all the darkness of the past?	modern
Nor I, my lord.	shakespearean
Hello and God bless you, sir.	modern
Now they believe it and withal whet me To be revenged on Rivers, Dorset, Grey; But then I sigh and, with a piece of scripture, Tell them that God bids us do good for evil; And thus I clothe my naked villainy With odd old ends stolen out of Holy Writ, And seem a saint when most I play the devil.	shakespearean
Have all his business ventures failed?	modern
Whatever your highness commands me to do, it is always my duty to do it.	modern
Even that I could put up with.	modern
Please, go away.	modern
I’m already here, sir.	modern
If you want to make me happy, don’t wish yourself harm.	modern
Just to the Tower—I’m guessing, for the same reason you are: to salute the noble princes who are staying there.	modern
No, don’t cry, kind Eros.	modern
Sirrah, go see what trumpet ’tis that sounds.	shakespearean
It’s not true.	modern
Yes, my lord, and calfskin too.	modern
Aunchient Pistol, I do partly understand your meaning.	shakespearean
Till then, enough.	shakespearean
No, I’ll go find some ditch to die in.	modern
I am poisoned.	shakespearean
No metal—not even the executioner’s axe—could ever be half as sharp as your hatred.	modern
Yea, just so much as you may take upon a knife’s point and choke a daw withal.	shakespearean
What have you done?	modern
Speak you so gently?	shakespearean
You embrace your charge too willingly.	shakespearean
And he’s gone.	shakespearean
Are you satisfied, Jew?	modern
The fellow has good judgment.	shakespearean
Yea, but so I am apt to do myself wrong.	shakespearean
Are you lovebirds only starting to pair up now?	modern
Right this instant, I’m going to Caesar’s funeral.	modern
Oh, such another sleep, that I might see But such another man!	shakespearean
There’s another.	modern
Even so.	shakespearean
I know not, madam.	shakespearean
Will they see us?	modern
I wish you’d be patient.	modern
But as I said, the general isn’t really in the mood to hear music now.	modern
I will give thee mine.	shakespearean
This poor guy’s partly confessed his plan.	modern
It’s Captain Macmorris, right?	modern
I want you to live, since to me, death is happiness.	modern
He speaks bluntly, madam.	modern
Who is this bloody man?	modern
And don’t be suspicious of me, noble Brutus.	modern
No, he loves and cherishes me.	modern
Victory sits on our helms.	shakespearean
That will I do.	shakespearean
If thou more murmur’st, I will rend an oak And peg thee in his knotty entrails till Thou hast howled away twelve winters.	shakespearean
I had forgot—three months.	shakespearean
When will he be here?	shakespearean
Then surrender, coward, and we’ll put you in a freakshow, just like they do with deformed animals.	modern
Here, at your service.	modern
Any strange beast there makes a man.	shakespearean
So quick bright things come to confusion.	shakespearean
I thank my noble lord.	shakespearean
He doesn’t know what he’s saying.	modern
I have nothing to do with what you’re talking about, my lord.	modern
You thought because he could not speak English in the native garb, he could not therefore handle an English cudgel.	shakespearean
Gentleman, I am not the same man I was before.	modern
Good my lord.	shakespearean
Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.	shakespearean
Stay, though thou kill me, sweet Demetrius.	shakespearean
His reason well I know.	shakespearean
I remember, Adam, that’s  Here comes my master, your brother.	modern
Where’s your lute?	modern
There he is.	shakespearean
Truly, I think they are.	shakespearean
How tartly that gentleman looks!	shakespearean
You are gentlemen of brave mettle.	shakespearean
I order you to come with me.	modern
You are my guests.	modern
Why should not we Be there in person?	shakespearean
Does everyone kill what they don’t love?	modern
Twill be recorded for a precedent, And many an error by the same example Will rush into the state.	shakespearean
Look, here are the boxes, prince.	modern
Yet but three?	shakespearean
I’ll meet you at the ferry.	modern
Varrus and Claudio!	modern
What, wilt thou hear some music, my sweet love?	shakespearean
Good gentlemen, give him a further edge, And drive his purpose on to these delights.	shakespearean
Mark well Metellus Cimber.	shakespearean
That’s true, that’s very true.	modern
But where will I lie tomorrow?	modern
Unless I am mistaken, Signior Baptista may remember me from the Pegasus in Genoa, where we both stayed twenty years ago.	modern
Here I am, Theseus.	modern
And  Madam, with all my heart.	modern
If Caesar please, our master Will leap to be his friend.	shakespearean
I hope you remember that I said all this because I love you.	modern
Fear me not.— She and the duke her husband!	shakespearean
I changed my mind.	modern
I was enforced to send it after him.	shakespearean
Let me have it now.	modern
This may prove food to my displeasure.	shakespearean
From the four corners of the earth they come To kiss this shrine, this mortal breathing saint.	shakespearean
I did send To you for gold to pay my legions, Which you denied me.	shakespearean
Our forces are ready for them.	modern
Are you answered?	shakespearean
It’s mine, sir.	modern
Signior Montano, Your trusty and most valiant servitor, With his free duty recommends you thus, And prays you to believe him.	shakespearean
You shall do marvelous wisely, good Reynaldo, Before you visit him, to make inquire Of his behavior.	shakespearean
Their hounds are unequaled in courage.	modern
The text is foolish.	shakespearean
No, the whole day, and all night too.	modern
If you come to me after tomorrow and say, “That’s my glove,” I swear by this hand, I will take it and give you a box on the ear.	modern
And so he fainted.	modern
How now?	shakespearean
Wherefore is this?	shakespearean
You liar, you respond better to the whip than to kindness!	modern
Beware the thane of Fife.	shakespearean
The bitter one is the other one—that’s you.LEAR Are you calling me a fool, boy?	modern
The storm separated us.	modern
I had rather be a country servant-maid Than a great queen with this condition, To be so baited, scorned, and stormèd at.	shakespearean
Is the news good or bad that you enter without knocking?	modern
Yes, ma'am, we have.	modern
May I with right and conscience make this claim?	shakespearean
Come down, brother.	modern
I’ll sell all my land.	shakespearean
Hermia is lucky, wherever she is, because she has beautiful eyes.	modern
What kind of fighting cock is this?	modern
Whatever kind you want, I guess.	modern
Welcome, my friends all.	shakespearean
Confess!—Handkerchief!—Oh, devil!— Work on, My medicine, work!	shakespearean
I mean, what sort of man is he?	modern
Please take them.	modern
If I could win a lady at leapfrog or by vaulting into my saddle with my armor on my back, under the correction of bragging be it spoken, I should quickly leap into a wife.	shakespearean
He that is giddy thinks the world turns round.	shakespearean
That she was false to wedlock?	shakespearean
Ah well, my Kate.	modern
You’re both wrong.	modern
Not really, for the truest poetry is often the most artificial.	modern
Pleaseth your Majesty to give me leave, I’ll muster up my friends and meet your Grace Where and what time your Majesty shall please.	shakespearean
Don’t provoke me any further or I’ll forget to restrain myself.	modern
What, my dear lord?	modern
That I have, lady.	shakespearean
The gods defend her!—hear him hence awhile.	shakespearean
Let him not leave out The color of her hair.	shakespearean
When I told you My state was nothing, I should then have told you That I was worse than nothing, for indeed I have engaged myself to a dear friend, Engaged my friend to his mere enemy To feed my means.	shakespearean
And so we will, provided that he win her.	shakespearean
Throw this slave Upon the dunghill.—Regan, I bleed apace.	shakespearean
Receive what cheer you may.	shakespearean
I think that thou art just and think thou art not.	shakespearean
Antony will use his affection where it is.	shakespearean
I’m sure I can guess.	modern
The servants Macbeth killed.	modern
Sir, I have no future ahead of me.	modern
Tis too narrow for your mind.	shakespearean
Someone deliver the order that Buckingham be brought to Salisbury.	modern
Why are you telling me this?	modern
Ah, that good Kent— He said it would be thus, poor banished man.	shakespearean
Good morrow, Kate—for that’s your name, I hear.	shakespearean
I do repent The tedious minutes I with her have spent.	shakespearean
That which I gave you.	shakespearean
As a matter of fact, if the playwright had played Pyramus and hanged himself with Thisbe’s belt, it would have been a very good tragedy.	modern
Let me speak my mind, and I’ll rid the world of its sickness—if it will only tolerate my medicine.	modern
I can arrange it so that at some indecent hour of the night, she looks out Hero’s bedroom window.	modern
Repose you there, while I to this hard house— More harder than the stones whereof ’tis raised, Which even but now, demanding after you, Denied me to come in—return, and force Their scanted courtesy.	shakespearean
Good your highness, patience.	shakespearean
Well, I’ll hurry and put these papers where you told me.	modern
I fear your disposition.	shakespearean
There’s something else to do.	shakespearean
Thou told’st me they were stol'n unto this wood.	shakespearean
I pray you, father, being weak, seem so.	shakespearean
He was more faithful to me than the sun is to the daytime.	modern
But Benedick was once an enemy of love as well, and now he’s become a real man.	modern
And will you, being a man of your breeding, be married under a bush like a beggar?	shakespearean
Once more, good night, kind lords and gentlemen.	shakespearean
He fears, my lord, you mean no good to him.	shakespearean
Farewell, dear mother.	shakespearean
Become a better	modern
He’s walking over there, sir.	modern
If you regard it as shameful, put the shame on me.	modern
If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds, Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.	shakespearean
The present time is like a woman in labor, each minute giving birth to some piece of news.	modern
They are loves I bear to you.	shakespearean
Go away!	modern
Our era should be ashamed!	modern
Why did Cassius conspire against Caesar?	modern
Oh, you should have done it without telling me!	modern
I’ll tell my husband what you’ve said, Launcelot.	modern
Pray you, go with us.	shakespearean
Thou art on thy deathbed.	shakespearean
The deep of night is crept upon our talk, And nature must obey necessity, Which we will niggard with a little rest.	shakespearean
How does my good Lord Hamlet?	shakespearean
If trembling I inhabit then, protest me The baby of a girl.	shakespearean
Look and see.	modern
The business she hath broached in the state Cannot endure my absence.	shakespearean
But you are no such man.	shakespearean
How can you stand there shamelessly talking about me and Hippolyta, when you know that I know about your love for Theseus?	modern
I’ll hire you again to go back to Rome.	modern
Go and tell them this.	modern
Therefore speak softly.	shakespearean
Come to my cave and tell me the rest of your story.—Good old man, you are as welcome here as your master is.	modern
Go, go.	shakespearean
And all for nothing— For Hecuba!	shakespearean
What did he say?	modern
The messengers from our sister and the king.	shakespearean
Why, the end is he hath lost a ship.	shakespearean
I wouldn’t do that for the whole wide world.	modern
The clock struck three.	modern
I am bid forth to supper, Jessica.	shakespearean
Put the goblets of wine on that table.	modern
Those that are good manners at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the behavior of the country is most mockable at the court.	shakespearean
As it is God’s will and pleasure, Captain, I entreat you to come quickly to the king.	modern
Let him go, Gertrude.	modern
Even her worst faults are charming, and holy priests bless her even when she acts the slut.	modern
I thought I heard a voice cry, “Sleep no more!	modern
Believe me, sir, they butt together well.	shakespearean
Please do.	modern
Had I as many mouths as Hydra, such an answer would stop them all.	shakespearean
But I’m sorry I’ve blurted all this out.	modern
I pray thee, peace.	shakespearean
How I wish you felt better!	modern
Wondrous heavy.	shakespearean
Come, explain.	modern
What is your pleasure, madam?	shakespearean
But if a man becomes weary of these obstacles, he can always kill himself.	modern
I wish you well, and so I take my leave.	shakespearean
Thou hast not, cousin.	shakespearean
Is my master and his wife coming, Grumio?	shakespearean
Prithee, no more.	shakespearean
I’m starting to lose my mind.	modern
The crows flying down below look as small as ants.	modern
Welcome, destruction, blood, and massacre!	modern
What was thy cause?	shakespearean
I forget, But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labors, Most busiest when I do it.	shakespearean
A most manly wit, Margaret, it will not hurt a woman.	shakespearean
You must have patience, madam.	shakespearean
Sure, her offense Must be of such unnatural degree That monsters it (or your fore-vouched affection Fall into taint), which to believe of her Must be a faith that reason without miracle Could never plant in me.	shakespearean
To thine and Albany’s issue Be this perpetual.—What says our second daughter, Our dearest Regan, wife of Cornwall?	shakespearean
Be better suited.	shakespearean
He shall not go to prison.	shakespearean
Which one of you killed the deer?	modern
Please give me a little credit!	modern
You are too much mistaken in this king.	shakespearean
A tomb Must cover thy sweet eyes.	shakespearean
I must attend mine office, Or would have done ’t myself.	shakespearean
Have you forgotten who I am?	modern
Yes, I thank God, my father, and yourself.	modern
We’ll take care of it.	modern
Then heaven have mercy on me.	modern
We’re sorry to hear this.	modern
He’ll run after her.	modern
The day, my friends, and everything await me.	modern
If it assume my noble father’s person, I’ll speak to it, though Hell itself should gape And bid me hold my peace.	shakespearean
My good qualities, my legal status as Desdemona’s husband, and my innocence will protect me.	modern

Come, sir, will you aboard?	shakespearean

Fear nothing.	shakespearean

But go away now.	modern
I pray, weep not.	shakespearean
Aren’t you a rational human being?	modern
Take in your love, and then let me alone.	shakespearean
And let my liver rather heat with wine Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.	shakespearean
By mine honor, in true English, I love thee, Kate.	shakespearean
I’ll lock up the doors, grab some more ducats, and be with you right away.	modern
Get lost, will you?	modern
But that I am forbid To tell the secrets of my prison house, I could a tale unfold whose lightest word Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,	shakespearean
O Goneril, You are not worth the dust which the rude wind Blows in your face.	shakespearean
No king of England if not king of France.	shakespearean
I’m terribly sleepy.	modern
You didn’t want to go then!	modern
If you weren’t my brother, I’d leave this hand of mine on your neck until I’d pulled out your tongue for talking like this.	modern
God, help us not be jealous!	modern
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars But in ourselves, that we are underlings.	shakespearean
I wouldn’t be the villain you think I am even if I were offered all of Macbeth’s kingdom and the riches of the East too.	modern
Good Enobarbus, make yourself my guest Whilst you abide here.	shakespearean
Why, there was a crown offered him; and, being offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand, thus; and then the people fell a-shouting.	shakespearean

Come with me.	modern
I’m afraid he will.	modern

Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most anything Alexas, almost most absolute Alexas, where’s the soothsayer that you praised so to th’ Queen?	shakespearean
Come, help to bear thy master.	shakespearean
My lord, I informed them as much.	modern
Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond, Thou but offend’st thy lungs to speak so loud.	shakespearean
Do it carefully.—And the noble and true-hearted Kent banished, his offense honesty!	shakespearean
Caesar, thou art revenged, Even with the sword that killed thee.	shakespearean
And may you prove, sir, master of your art.	shakespearean
Ay, my lord.	shakespearean
But in that “no hope” there are great hopes for you!	modern

The heavens forbid But that our loves and comforts should increase, Even as our days do grow.	shakespearean
Go, lad, and find out what the trumpet’s sounding for.	modern
Why, our troops amount to three times that.	modern
What proof shall I make of that?	shakespearean
I warrant your honor.	shakespearean
Never, till Caesar’s three and thirty wounds Be well avenged, or till another Caesar Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors.	shakespearean
A greater gift than that I’ll give my cousin.	shakespearean
Since he has the jewel I loved, which you swore you’d keep forever, I’ll be as generous as you were to him.	modern
Ay, there it is.	shakespearean
Have you heard any news of impending battle?	modern
Conspiracies, fakery, betrayal, and disorder are all that’s left until we die.	modern
The advancement of your children, noble lady.	modern
Look how she rubs her hands.	modern
So say I. Methinks you are sadder.	shakespearean

Look to my chattels and my movables.	shakespearean
Stanley, he is your wife’s son.	shakespearean
I robbed his wound of it.	shakespearean

Yes, my good lord.	modern
Oh, I wish I were a man!	modern
Please go.	modern

Cross him in nothing.	shakespearean
Go, my dread lord, to your great-grandsire’s tomb, From whom you claim.	shakespearean
This is the excellent foppery of the world that when we are sick in fortune—often the surfeit of our own behavior—we make guilty of our disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars, as if we were villains by necessity, fools by heavenly compulsion, knaves, thieves, and treachers by spherical predominance, drunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforced obedience of planetary influence, and all that we are evil in by a divine thrusting-on.	shakespearean
Look how far that little candle sends its light!	modern
I’d be angry with you if the occasion allowed.	modern
We’ll send Mark Antony to the senate house, And he shall say you are not well today.	shakespearean
Caesar and he are greater friends than ever.	shakespearean
Nay, guiltiness Will speak, though tongues were out of use.	shakespearean
You’ll be pricked all over, and it’ll sting like bees.	modern
But they aren’t.	modern
Why did I come here if not for that?	modern
I pray you, tell it.	shakespearean
No, no, I’m as ugly as a bear, since animals that see me run away in terror.	modern
You will not blame us in your funeral speech, but will say all the good you want to about Caesar and that you do it by our permission.	modern
What are thy comings in?	shakespearean
I was just knocking to see if anyone was home.	modern
I wish your Worship well.	shakespearean
The tender prince Would fain have come with me to meet your Grace, But by his mother was perforce withheld.	shakespearean
Then Edgar was abused.	shakespearean
Where are your tenants and your followers?	modern
Oh, except for the widow Dido?	modern
God protect you from tornadoes, evil stars, and diseases!	modern
I’m Sir Rowland’s middle son, and I bring you news.	modern
My master is being difficult.	modern
And I for no woman.	shakespearean

Will you have dinner with me tonight, Casca?	modern
Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother?	shakespearean
Let me hear Agrippa further speak.	shakespearean
We’ll perform all the holy rites.	modern
He’s talking with the bogus father about the bogus son.	modern
To die, to sleep.	shakespearean
Look, where she comes.	shakespearean
It is a business of some heat.	shakespearean
But, look, poor me, what a terrible tragedy is here!	modern
Oh, fie upon them!	shakespearean
I was sure your lordship did not give it me.	shakespearean
It were well The general were put in mind of it.	shakespearean
I know not, lady.	shakespearean
Don’t wake her.	modern
No marvel, lord, though it affrighted you.	shakespearean
I’m no ordinary fairy.	modern
Your brother the Bastard is fled from Messina.	shakespearean
I’m begging you.	modern
Is it because of	modern
Turn right at the next turn, but at the following turn, turn left.	modern
I’ll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool To shake the head, relent and sigh, and yield To Christian intercessors.	shakespearean
There are tears for his love, joy for his fortune, honor for his bravery, and death for his ambition.	modern
It’s obvious.	modern
Edmund, seek him out, wind me into him, I pray you.	shakespearean
God grant we never may have need of you.	shakespearean
You see me here, you gods, a poor old man, As full of grief as age, wretched in both.	shakespearean
My evidence that you have wronged me is that you condemned and disgraced Lucius Pella for taking bribes here from the Sardinians, and you ignored my letters, where I argued that he was innocent; I know the man.	modern
The people fear me in the country and the town.	modern
Nice to see you again, Horatio—that is your name, right?	modern
Do not lie so near.	shakespearean
No, my fair cousin.	shakespearean
If we be not relieved within this hour, We must return to th’ court of guard.	shakespearean
But were I Brutus, And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue In every wound of Caesar that should move The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.	shakespearean
Well, then it isn’t one to you, since nothing is really good or bad in itself—it’s all what a person thinks about it.	modern
God and his angels guard your sacred throne And make you long become it.	shakespearean
And then return to you and nothing else?	modern
Thank you, sir.	modern
Evil villain!	modern
Out, fool.	shakespearean
The same thing.	modern
Oh, how I wish we could oppose Caesar’s spirit—his overblown ambition—and not hack up Caesar himself!	modern
He was also shocked to learn that on the same day you fought the rebels you also fought against the army of Norway, and that you weren’t the least bit afraid of death, even as you killed everyone around you.	modern
Come, temperate nymphs, and help to celebrate A contract of true love.	shakespearean
Will he bring his army?	modern
You’ve stunned him.	modern
And in good time here the lieutenant comes.— Master Lieutenant, pray you, by your leave, How doth the prince and my young son of York?	shakespearean
Here’s the hut, my lord.	modern
Oh, no, good gentleman!	modern
He is composed and framed of treachery, And fled he is upon this villainy.	shakespearean
Sir, I say to you we are none.	shakespearean
Merciful powers, keep away the nightmares that plague me when I rest!	modern
Instance, briefly.	shakespearean
I had thought t’ have held it poor; but since my lord Is Antony again, I will be Cleopatra.	shakespearean
I had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad— and to travel for it, too.	shakespearean
Oh, let me see thee walk!	shakespearean
When she landed at the port, Antony sent an invitation for her to come to supper.	modern
How long within this wood intend you stay?	shakespearean
There was none such in the army of any sort.	shakespearean
And since you know you can see yourself best by reflection, I’ll be your mirror and show you, without exaggeration, things inside you that you can’t see.	modern
That’s music to my ears.	modern
I cannot drink too much of Brutus’s love.	modern
Come here, Ariel.	modern
God knows I waited for you in anguish, pain, and agony when I gave birth to you.	modern
It wasn’t the journey itself, uncle, but the troubles we encountered that made it wearisome and dull.	modern
Ay, but the feet were lame and could not bear themselves without the verse, and therefore stood lamely in the verse.	shakespearean
Is that called for in the contract?	modern
Will the moon be shining on the night we’re performing our play?	modern
How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!	shakespearean
The sky’s so dark it looks like it would rain down boiling hot tar if the sea weren’t swelling up to the sky to put its fire out.	modern
I wouldn’t dream of opposing such an obviously promising idea.	modern
Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal, And you must put me in your heart for friend, Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear, That he which hath your noble father slain Pursued my life.	shakespearean
It is no matter.	shakespearean
And I’ve never met any men besides you and my father.	modern
Why, man, I saw Bassanio under sail.	shakespearean
We know each other’s faces, but as for our thoughts, he doesn’t know any more about my thinking than I do about yours or his—or you do about mine.	modern
I shall attend you presently at your tent.	shakespearean
Miranda.—Oh father, I’ve disobeyed you by telling him that!	modern
Then half Signor Benedick’s tongue in Count John’s mouth, and half Count John’s melancholy in Signor Benedick’s face— With a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and money enough in his purse, such a man would win any woman in the world, if he could get her goodwill.	shakespearean
He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven And fire us hence like foxes.	shakespearean
Sir, it’s the Moor.	modern
Let me speak like yourself and lay a sentence Which, as a grise or step, may help these lovers.	shakespearean
Use your authority.	shakespearean
But oh, how oddly will it sound that I Must ask my child forgiveness!	shakespearean
Or at least that’s what I plan to do before I let you go.	modern
Show his eyes and grieve his heart.	shakespearean
Give him the instructions for our amusing little contract, and I’ll go get the money for you right away.	modern
Bad deeds will be revealed, no matter how people try to hide them.	modern
What, would you make me mad?	shakespearean
Okay, but please not before me.	modern
What did your song mean, lady?	modern
Why, the honest men.	shakespearean
Really, I think your other ruff is better.	modern
Please don’t play games.	modern
Stay, on thy peril.	shakespearean
No doubt the murd'rous knife was dull and blunt Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart, To revel in the entrails of my lambs.	shakespearean
Note this before my notes: There’s not a note of mine that’s worth the noting.	shakespearean
Good Corporal Nym, show thy valor and put up your sword.	shakespearean
I won’t be hit, my lord.	modern
A plague upon this howling!	shakespearean
Thy father!	shakespearean
It does, my lord.	shakespearean
If you’re joining together to right these wrongs, I’ll go as far as any one of you.	modern
I can only do it by lying, my lord, but I can do it so secretly that no one will suspect me.	modern
I knew it would be your answer.	shakespearean
You must be father to your brother’s daughter, And give her to young Claudio.	shakespearean
So when he opens his purse to give us our reward, thy conscience flies out.	shakespearean
Here is more news.	shakespearean
I’m not going to eat dinner tonight.	modern
The duke’s trumpets.	modern
Iago is gesturing for me to come closer.	modern
You shall Have letters from me to some friends that will Sweep your way for you.	shakespearean
Call him hither to me, soldier.	shakespearean
I charge you, get you home.	shakespearean
Spit, fire!	shakespearean
Was it a man?	modern
Let ’t be so, good Corporal Nym.	shakespearean
You’re thought to be the most	modern
My money is almost spent, I have been tonight exceedingly well cudgeled, and I think the issue will be I shall have so much experience for my pains.	shakespearean
What should I speak?	shakespearean
Our house is hell, and thou, a merry devil, Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness.	shakespearean
You are welcome.	shakespearean
Is she not a modest young lady?	shakespearean
My salad days, When I was green in judgment, cold in blood, To say as I said then.	shakespearean
My lord, I will not.	shakespearean
They ought to be whipped for being so stupid.	modern
It’s the truth.	modern
A conclusion, a conclusion: he is in love.	modern
Made I him king for this?	shakespearean
What’s up, man?	modern
The motion’s good indeed and be it so.— Petruchio, I shall be your	shakespearean
They would have me as familiar with men’s pockets as their gloves or their handkerchers, which makes much against my manhood, if I should take from another’s pocket to put into mine, for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs.	shakespearean
Question your Grace the late ambassadors With what great state he heard their embassy, How well supplied with noble counselors, How modest in exception, and withal How terrible in constant resolution, And you shall find his vanities forespent Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus, Covering discretion with a coat of folly, As gardeners do with ordure hide those roots That shall first spring and be most delicate.	shakespearean
Why are your swords out?	modern
Portia, goodbye to you.	modern
Caesar, I shall.	shakespearean
So to most noble Caesar.	shakespearean
Why, then he’ll say we stabbed him sleeping.	shakespearean
The fire seven times tried this, Seven times tried that judgment is, That did never choose amiss.	shakespearean
There’d be no kingship— He wants to be king in a place with no kingship.	modern
And that were enough to hang us all.	shakespearean
Now I’m afraid we’ve lost your son forever.	modern
The carriages, sir, are the hangers.	shakespearean
But these days, people give each other their hands without their hearts.	modern
Where art thou, proud Demetrius?	shakespearean
Here I am.	shakespearean
Who is leading his men?	modern
We don’t want it at our festivities.	modern
I told him that your father was at Venice, And that you looked for him this day in Padua.	shakespearean
Can you imagine being hitched to a lump of clay?	modern
How now?	shakespearean
So will you say when you have seen the sequel.	shakespearean
Who was that?	modern
I have a reasonable good ear in music.	shakespearean
The same indeed, a very valiant fellow.	shakespearean
In the fact that it’s solitary, I enjoy it very much; but in the sense that it’s private, it’s terrible.	modern
Here lie I down and measure out my grave.	shakespearean
Were such things here as we do speak about?	shakespearean
Signior Benedick!	modern
Me too, lieutenant.	modern
I cannot live out of her company.	shakespearean
I am glad to see you.	shakespearean
But you still wish the gods had made me poetical?	modern
First, Peter Quince, tell us what the play is about, then read the names of the actors, and then shut up.	modern
Those that are married already, all but one, shall live.	shakespearean
And I’ll tell him about the letter too.	modern
We are yet but young in deed.	shakespearean
No, not for Venice.	shakespearean
Oh, you’re sticking a dagger in me!	modern
Sheep pens are empty in the middle of the flooded fields, and the crows get fat from eating the dead bodies of infected sheep.	modern
Indeed, I am no mourner for that news, Because they have been still my adversaries.	shakespearean
Why then, we are awake.	shakespearean
Yes, as safe as her brothers' lives were.	modern
So the pale, angry moon, who controls the tides, fills the air with diseases.	modern
You shall not go, my lord.	shakespearean
Tell every soldier to break off a branch and hold it in front of him.	modern
She’s gone.	modern
Yes, by heaven!	shakespearean
Ah, Buckingham, now do I play the touch, To try if thou be current gold indeed.	shakespearean
I tell you, Charles, he’s the stubbornest young fellow in France: overly ambitious, jealous of other people’s good qualities, and a traitor against me, his own blood brother.	modern
But was this near the shore?	modern
Let copulation thrive, for Gloucester’s bastard son Was kinder to his father than my daughters got ’tween the lawful sheets.	shakespearean
Speak, if you can: what are you?	shakespearean
I will piece out the comfort with what addition I can.	shakespearean
You said it right, old mole.	modern
There isn’t a single protrusion in the castle walls where these birds haven’t built their hanging nests to sleep and breed.	modern
Play the music.—Take my hands, my queen, and we’ll lull these people to sleep with our soft dancing.	modern
Are you his friend?	modern
The king sent us to give you his thanks and to bring you to him.	modern
Often I have heard of “sanctuary men,” but until now I’ve never heard of “sanctuary children.” My lord, you’ve won me over this time.	modern
Now, Signior, what news?	shakespearean
How doth the lady?	shakespearean
That courtesy would be uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds.	shakespearean
Give you good morrow.	shakespearean
To flatter Caesar, would you mingle eyes With one that ties his points?	shakespearean
By God, I wouldn’t lose as much honor as a single man more would cost me, I think—not even if it meant giving up my best hope for victory.	modern
His eyes are red as fire with weeping.	shakespearean
Lives my sweet son?	shakespearean
You’re a spirit, I know.	modern
Therefore you must run, noble Cassius.	modern
No, cousin, I’m going to Fife.	modern
Tis well.	shakespearean
To bait fish withal.	shakespearean
My husband say that she was false!	shakespearean
I swear, I scorn the word.	modern
Better to have an extra servant on hand than be understaffed.	modern
It’s better that you didn’t kill him.	modern
He shall tell them so.	shakespearean
Henry Lord Scroop of Masham, I arrest you for high treason.	modern
Not one drop sooner.	modern
It applies to you as much as to me, my lord.	modern
I would I knew thy heart.	shakespearean
Hearts, tongues, figures, scribes, bards, poets, cannot Think, speak, cast, write, sing, number—hoo!— His love to Antony.	shakespearean
None of us.	modern
I’m old and foolish.	modern
Go quickly—hurry—to the castle, for I’ve given orders to have Lear and Cordelia killed.	modern
I would not be cured, youth.	shakespearean
Though I have far more reason, I don’t have as much energy to curse you.	modern
Good sister, wrong me not nor wrong yourself, To make a bondmaid and a slave of me.	shakespearean
I’ll leave thee Now like a man of steel.	shakespearean
Nay, I have done.	shakespearean
Henceforth I’ll bear Affliction till it do cry out itself, “Enough, enough,” and die.	shakespearean
I will go seek him.—Cassio, walk hereabout.	shakespearean
Why, do you know of any harm intended toward him?	modern
As manhood shall compound.	shakespearean
I have, my lord.	shakespearean
So could I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after, That Lucentio indeed had Baptista’s youngest daughter.	shakespearean
Oh, it’s horrible of her.	modern
Sir, most heedfully.	shakespearean
That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.	shakespearean
I think I’ve found one already, thanks to you, my lord.	modern
I go, I go.	shakespearean
Good sir, to the purpose.	shakespearean
Oh, my lord, what do you mean by that?	modern
A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch, Past speaking of in a king.	shakespearean
The general should be informed about this.	modern
Your clothes aren’t spattered with my family’s blood, and you aren’t affected by my curse.	modern
Come on, you’re drunk.	modern
I’d rather be a toad in a moldy basement than to have only a part of someone I love, sharing the rest of her with others.	modern
I durst not!	shakespearean
Don’t believe any of us.	modern
Though Birnam Wood be come to Dunsinane, And thou opposed, being of no woman born, Yet I will try the last.	shakespearean
Nor for yours neither.	shakespearean
Macbeth will go there to learn his destiny.	modern
What do you think that means?	modern
But what do I care about words?	modern
My soul will keep yours company on the way to heaven.	modern
Thou shalt not lose by it.	shakespearean
Upon the talk of the poisoning?	shakespearean
And whoever lives to see that day Will walk with his feet.	modern
Good night, brother.	modern
Then teach your cousin to also be willing to close her eyes, my lord.	modern
Soldiers, have careful watch.	shakespearean
The wine she drinks is made of grapes.	shakespearean
Just as you’d like to have your sins forgiven, Indulge me, forgive me, and set me free.	modern
Are you good or evil?	modern
Therefore be merry, Cassio, For thy solicitor shall rather die Than give thy cause away.	shakespearean
Oh, just see what happens after the pageantry is over!	modern
Tis true, my brother’s daughter’s Queen of Tunis, So is she heir of Naples, ’twixt which regions There is some space.	shakespearean
You may hear about it soon.	modern
Just as I told you, he usually sleeps in the afternoon.	modern
Keep your voice down.	modern
God protect me from these two!	modern
I beseech you pardon me, my lord, if I be mistaken—for my duty cannot be silent when I think your highness wronged.	shakespearean
Who is conductor of his people?	shakespearean
It might as well be the same with Caesar.	modern
Not yet.” Well, the time has come.	modern
If thou dost find him tractable to us, Encourage him and show him all our reasons.	shakespearean
It is a nipping and an eager air.	shakespearean
I heard the galloping of horses.	modern

I pray you, pass with your best violence.	shakespearean
Had I a glass, I would.	shakespearean
She is a royal princess.	shakespearean
When I was still living with him I heard him swear to Tubal and Cush, his countrymen, that he’d rather have Antonio’s flesh than twenty times the sum Antonio owed.	modern
To both their deaths shalt thou be accessory.	shakespearean
What canst thou swear by now?	shakespearean
No, make it two more.	shakespearean
He has my dying voice.	shakespearean
I’ve heard that the pyramids build by the Ptolemies are splendid.	modern
You look tired.	modern
Now all labor Mars what it does.	shakespearean
It’s not for me to say.	modern
Maybe you will find a husband without a beard.	modern
If you meet the Prince in the night, you may stay him.	shakespearean
Alas, the storm is come again!	shakespearean
I pray you tell your brother how well I counterfeited.	shakespearean
Come, warble for me.	modern
O limèd soul that, struggling to be free, Art more engaged!	shakespearean
Or else their guardians and advisors said no— What hell, to have your love life determined by someone else!	modern
For half thy wealth, it is Antonio’s.	shakespearean
But for which of my good parts did you first suffer love for me?	shakespearean
Will you come with us?	modern
I’ll stand, and so will Trinculo.	modern
Hortensio and I have given you up.	modern
All traitors protest like this.	modern
The English force, so please you.	shakespearean
Yes, and it seemed twice as long to me, having been kept from your bed that whole time.	modern
I’ll give you a good reason to cringe, I promise you.	modern
Our action will seem too bloody if we cut off Caesar’s head and then hack at his arms and legs too, Caius Cassius—because Mark Antony is merely one of Caesar’s arms.	modern
Most savage and unnatural!	shakespearean
I’ve hired five hundred almsmen to hold up their withered hands to heaven, praying for my pardon twice a day throughout the year.	modern
My villainy?	shakespearean
Hello, beautiful Helena!	modern
With one little toss of his head, He can scare you off for good.	modern
Come, come.	shakespearean
Thou 'rt kind.	shakespearean
Dreams are a sign of ambition, since ambition is nothing more than the shadow of a dream.	modern
Isn’t he a horrible man?	modern
Is there any natural cause for hardening of the heart?	modern
Come hither, come!	shakespearean
Hear me, my lord.	shakespearean
You weren’t good enough for her.	modern
Be it so.	shakespearean
But both of these were put off by Elizabeth Grey, a careworn mother of many children who had once been a beauty but was now a stressed-out widow long past her prime.	modern
Give me thy hand, Roderigo.	shakespearean
I’ll take no lesser name than that of  Something that refers to my current state.	modern
Why do you make such faces?	shakespearean
And neither man nor master would take aught But the two rings.	shakespearean
Cassio, do you know who might have stabbed you like this?	modern
Here I kneel: If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love, Either in discourse of thought or actual deed, Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense, Delighted them, or any other form, Or that I do not yet, and ever did,	shakespearean
Tomorrow morning come you to my house, And since you could not be my son-in-law, Be yet my nephew.	shakespearean
It’s the smartest partition I’ve ever heard speak, my lord.	modern
My lord, his majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager on your head.	shakespearean
Now sits the wind fair, and we will aboard.	shakespearean
O sweet Portia, Here are a few of the unpleasant’st words That ever blotted paper.	shakespearean
I say you’re not.	modern
From all such devils, good Lord, deliver us!	shakespearean
I shaked you, sir, and cried.	shakespearean

He will be given safe conduct and money for his passage home.	modern
By this marriage, All little jealousies, which now seem great, And all great fears, which now import their dangers, Would then be nothing.	shakespearean
But sure I fear we shall not win him to it.	shakespearean
Only yesterday the word of Caesar might have stood against the world.	modern
There must be some political news from Venice, or some dangerous plot here in Cyprus has ruined his good mood.	modern
Please, young sir.	modern
How chance the roses there do fade so fast?	shakespearean
Art thou so hasty?	shakespearean
Happy the parents of so fair a child.	shakespearean
It’s strange that you haven’t heard.	modern
God witness with me, I have wept for thine.	shakespearean
That’s a fault.	shakespearean
Sirs, never mind.	modern
Bring him through the bands.	shakespearean
If there are any, speak, for it is he whom I’ve offended.	modern
Shame on you, warped hag!	modern
Be my witness, oh you blessed moon.	modern
I don’t think there’s a single unhappy subject living under the protection of your government.	modern
I doubt it.	modern
O heavy deed!	shakespearean
Goodbye, then.	modern
Go, girl.	shakespearean
But tell me.	modern
Sola, sola!	shakespearean
Don’t get up yet.	modern
Here, stand behind this wall; he’ll come right away.	modern
Oh, right, good Catesby.	modern
And I believe—unless this brain of mine is not so politically cunning as it used to be—that I’ve found out why Hamlet’s gone crazy.	modern
But to tell you the truth, reason and love have very little to do with each other these days.	modern
O, give me leave.	shakespearean
Call up the Master Constable Dogberry.	modern
What beard were I best to play it in?	shakespearean
O traitors, villains!	shakespearean
Come with a thought.	shakespearean
And shall, sir.	shakespearean
Anyway, what’s up?	modern
I won’t bother you.	modern
Ophelia, come here.—   I hear him coming.	modern
You’ve come to face a ruthless enemy, an inhuman wretch incapable of pity, without any feelings of mercy.	modern
That is the very defect of the matter, sir.	shakespearean
What power can rein in promiscuous evil once it’s gotten rolling?	modern
You’re  Forgive me, Signior Gremio, but I’m anxious to get things moving.	modern
Nothing that I know for sure, but a lot that I’m afraid might happen.	modern
It would be better if you actually applied it to your life.	modern
All of us have reason to mourn the dimming of our shining star the king.	modern
Oh, Antony, you extravagantly generous man, how would you have rewarded me for serving you faithfully when you reward my badness with all of this gold!	modern
Farewell, kind Charmian.	shakespearean
Lo thee!	shakespearean
Since I’m suddenly all the rage, it will be worth the cost.	modern
What do you want with me?	modern
Do, good friend.	shakespearean
If thou follow him, thou must needs wear my coxcomb.—How now, nuncle?	shakespearean
Goodbye, Helena.	modern
Nay, but hear me.	shakespearean
Oh, this is the poison of deep grief.	shakespearean
Not for all this land Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.	shakespearean
What’s that trumpet for?	modern
Come, you deceive yourself.	shakespearean
Then there is no true lover in the forest, else sighing every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of time as well as a clock.	shakespearean
Let me refer to a proverb that may help you forgive these lovers: if you can’t change something, don’t cry about it.	modern
There are no tricks in plain and simple faith.	shakespearean
No, my lord, unless I could have another husband for the work week.	modern
I would know that.	shakespearean
The shrill-gorged lark so far Cannot be seen or heard.	shakespearean
I do but beg a little changeling boy, To be my henchman.	shakespearean
Behold where stands The usurper’s cursèd head.	shakespearean
I’ll warm myself by blowing on the fire.	modern
And make sure to carry a prayer book in your hand and to stand between two priests, okay?	modern
I’ve rented land from you and your father for eighty years.	modern
Bring him to me.	modern
Dear Macduff, I beg you, tell us you were lying and say it isn’t so.	modern
But quiet.	modern
Bring ink and paper, Charmian.	modern
Tell me.	modern
Give me that letter, sir.	modern
Neither to you nor any one, having no witness to confirm my speech.	shakespearean
You’ll get a blow from me for that, I think.	modern
My fair Bianca, bid my father welcome, While I with selfsame kindness welcome thine.	shakespearean
I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak’st.	shakespearean
I’ll invite the duke and all of his followers.	modern
Believe me on my honor and keep my honor in mind, so you may believe me.	modern
I slept well, ate well, and was happy.	modern
If you cannot, give thanks you have lived so long and make yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of the hour, if it so hap.—Cheerly, good hearts!—Out of our way, I say.	shakespearean
And even though Nature has given us the wit to have this argument, hasn’t Fortune sent this fool here to stop us?	modern
Do not, Phoebe.	modern
Briefly, I dwell by the Capitol.	shakespearean
What mean’st thou by that?	shakespearean
But though they jump not on a just account— As in these cases, where the aim reports 'Tis oft with difference—yet do they all confirm A Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.	shakespearean
It is a hint That wrings mine eyes to ’t.	shakespearean
You can be married tomorrow if you want.	modern
I’m sorry you don’t have time.—Antonio, give this gentleman a reward.	modern
The tyrant I’m serving now can go to hell!	modern
Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.	shakespearean
Not so fast.	modern
Take you, as ’twere, some distant knowledge of him, As thus: “I know his father and his friends, And, in part, him.” Do you mark this, Reynaldo?	shakespearean
The wind’s whipping up the waves so high you expect them to reach the clouds and splash against the stars in the sky.	modern
I pray you call them in.	shakespearean
And your father was Duke of Milan, and you were his heir, a princess.	modern
Ay, my good lord.	shakespearean
Come hither, Leonato.	shakespearean
This is a rotten song to sing at a man’s funeral.	modern
Twelve years ago, Miranda, twelve years ago your father was the Duke of Milan, a powerful prince.	modern
I am at your service.	modern
Fix your example, shepherd.	modern
Here lies Hero, The heroic maiden killed by slanderous words.	modern
He answered, “You penniless bastard!	modern
Then every soldier kill his prisoners.	shakespearean
But enough about that.	modern
Your worth is very dear in my regard.	shakespearean
Caesar, I never stood on ceremonies, Yet now they fright me.	shakespearean
So that’s what I’ll do, not because I love her but because I’ll get something out of it.	modern
Well, your imprisonment shall not be long.	shakespearean
One voice speaks well and talks about his friend.	modern
Now, Roderigo, Where didst thou see her?—Oh, unhappy girl!— With the Moor, say’st thou?—Who would be a father?— How didst thou know ’twas she?—Oh, she deceives me Past thought!—What said she to you?—Get more tapers, Raise all my kindred.	shakespearean
I am bound to hear.	shakespearean
Tis partly my own fault, Which death or absence soon shall remedy.	shakespearean
I can’t explain it.	modern
When they choose, they only know how to lose.	modern
Let it all go.	modern
I’ll meet all your attacks, even if you come charging at me with a lance at full gallop.	modern
Self-love, my liege, is not so vile a sin As self-neglecting.	shakespearean
Show me briefly how.	shakespearean
Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar, Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat An humble heart—     I must prevent thee, Cimber.	shakespearean
I hope he be in love.	shakespearean
An’t please your Honor, players That offer service to your Lordship.	shakespearean
Among them are one hundred twenty-six princes and standard-bearing nobles.	modern
Oh, good Demetrius, will you find him for me?	modern
Your attendant asses are getting the horses ready.	modern
I’d tell them that I saw natives like these—since they must be natives—who are graceful and well-mannered even if they’re monstrous to look at, kinder than most human beings you might find— kinder than almost any human.	modern
Now go, and hurry back.	modern
Our power is ready; Our lack is nothing but our leave.	shakespearean
Then show it me.	shakespearean
Wrong not her birth.	shakespearean
You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should.	shakespearean
You know that he does.	modern
Ah, I’ve got it!	modern
Say no more.	modern
Though I wish you were dead, I’m not going to be the one to kill you.	modern
Is it not Hero?	shakespearean
If this be not that you look for, I have no more to say, But bid Bianca farewell forever and a day.	shakespearean
Is she enclosed in silver, which is ten times less valuable than gold?	modern
You cannot better be employed, Bassanio, Than to live still and write mine epitaph.	shakespearean
Evil spirit, I want to talk some more.	modern
If our criminal master gets off free, I won’t care what happens to me anymore.	modern
Will you have her?	shakespearean
Nay, send in time!	shakespearean
You must all keep up this united front.	modern
Nothing in his life Became him like the leaving it.	shakespearean
A messenger has arrived from Caesar.	modern
He is drowned Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks Our frustrate search on land.	shakespearean
Oh, he hasn’t?	modern
Let’s shake on it.	modern
Since I was so drawn to studying things like logic, grammar, geometry, and astronomy, I let my control of the government slide a bit, being too wrapped up in my occult books.	modern
The carriages, sir, are the hangers—where the swords hang.	modern
It’s too bad.	modern
Are you scared?	modern
My young master doth expect your reproach.	shakespearean
My lord, I shall reply amazèdly, Half sleep, half waking.	shakespearean
And a chain, that you once wore, about his neck.	shakespearean
That’s where I’m going now, so I’ll leave you here.	modern
Listen to you!	modern
I know him well by reputation.	modern
The lack of time and the risk I’m under will have to keep us from bonding and catching up on each other’s news the way we usually would after not seeing each other for so long.	modern
It’s true, that wasn’t such a nice thing to do.	modern
Don’t be afraid.	modern
Send a message to his brother.	modern
To be your fellow You may deny me, but I’ll be your servant Whether you will or no.	shakespearean
I saw Bassanio and Antonio part.	shakespearean
You are very sensible, and yet you miss my sense: I mean, Hortensio is afeard of you.	shakespearean
Be not offended.	shakespearean
Bid him Report the feature of Octavia: her years, Her inclination.	shakespearean
Good sirs, take heart.	shakespearean
But I’m not dying yet!	modern
For she is wise, if I can judge of her.	shakespearean
If you prove a mutineer, the next tree.	shakespearean
The king doth love you well.	shakespearean
He’s laughed at my losses, made fun of my earnings, humiliated my race, thwarted my deals, turned my friends against me, riled up my enemies—and why?	modern
With him out of Venice, I can make whatever bargains I want when I lend money.—Go, Tubal.	modern
Their story is bizarre and astounding, but it’s solid and consistent.	modern
Isn’t that the reason you told me all this?	modern
The young snake that escaped will in time become poisonous and threatening, but for now he has no fangs.	modern
This kindness will I show.	shakespearean
Whereby hangs a tale, sir?	shakespearean
And an ill singer, my lord.	shakespearean
Put your straw hats on, have some fun, and dance with these young nymphs.	modern
He did not call, he’s busy in the paper.	shakespearean
My lord, your promise for the earldom— Richmond!	shakespearean
Come, let us sup betimes, that afterwards We may digest our complots in some form.	shakespearean
It’s weird.	modern
To the field!	modern
Thank God I’m not a woman and afflicted with all the giddiness that troubles that entire sex.	modern
Bring it hither to me in the orchard.	shakespearean
Everything’s ready.	modern
The king is virtuous and kind.	modern
But ’tis strange.	shakespearean
Can you ask around and find out?	modern
And you,  And how are you liking the shepherd’s life, Master Touchstone?	modern
She hath prevented me.	shakespearean
Therefore use thy discretion.	shakespearean
Be choked with such another emphasis!	shakespearean
Look, it’s going away.	modern
I know you’re my oldest brother, and deserve more respect.	modern
My lord, the mayor of London is here to greet you.	modern
Orlando, do you really believe that this boy can do everything he’s promised?	modern
Where’s lady Portia?	modern
Well, let’s sit down and listen to Barnardo tell us.	modern
And how, out of your great heap of knowledge, will you manage to prove that?	modern
When shall we three meet again?	shakespearean
A golden mind doesn’t bend down to choose something worthless.	modern
Richard loves Richard, that is, there’s just me and myself here.	modern
If my doing what you told me to makes you happy, then be happy, because I did it.	modern
I heard someone say that’s what it means.	modern
Look at Macbeth—he’s in a daze.	modern
Oh Scotland, Scotland!	modern
You are about as much of a thinker as worm’s meat is a nice steak.	modern
But tell us, do you hear whether Antonio have had any loss at sea or no?	shakespearean
But I didn’t want you to think that I’m hasty in my emotions.	modern
I could be well moved if I were as you.	shakespearean
A friend?	shakespearean
No, I will go seek Some ditch wherein to die.	shakespearean
Wilt thou have me?	shakespearean
Did you see anything?	modern
And like I am for Rosalind.	modern
I tell you, Captain, if you look at a map of the world, I’ll bet you will find, comparing Macedon and Monmouth, that the situations, see, are very similar.	modern
Methought I lay Worse than the mutines in the bilboes.	shakespearean
Honest Iago Hath ta'en order for ’t.	shakespearean
She ate no meat today, nor none shall eat.	shakespearean
But I beg your pardon.	modern
Ay, and to wage this battle at Pharsalia, Where Caesar fought with Pompey.	shakespearean
I didn’t say free, madam.	modern
What do you want from me, my good man?	modern
If she orders me to go, I’ll thank her warmly as if she’d just offered to put me up for a week.	modern
Where they feared the death, they have borne life away; and where they would be safe, they perish.	shakespearean
But, tell me, is young George Stanley alive?	modern
But tell me, monsieur—what sport are the ladies missing?	modern
Come your ways.	shakespearean
Shylock, they’re offering you three times the money you lent.	modern
If you complain any more, I’ll split an oak tree and lock you up in it till you’ve howled for twelve years.	modern
Let George Stanley die after the battle.	modern
Goodbye to you both.	modern
Is he well shipped?	shakespearean
Instead of crying, let’s keep hold of our swords and defend our fallen homeland like honorable men.	modern
Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left Is that she will not add to her damnation A sin of perjury.	shakespearean
Oh, Cleopatra!	modern
I’ve been tricked.	modern
Egypt, thou knew’st too well My heart was to thy rudder tied by th’ strings, And thou shouldst tow me after.	shakespearean
If I can recover him and keep him tame, I will not take too much for him.	shakespearean
And is it thus?	shakespearean
And this is Metellus Cimber.	modern
You must understand, Silius, that it’s better to leave something undone than achieve too much fame in your superior’s absence.	modern
I could well forbear ’t.	shakespearean
My dear sir!	modern
I’ll hide and listen in.	modern
I couldn’t pay my debt to the Jew on the due date.	modern
I say amen to her.	shakespearean
I prithee, call him back.	shakespearean
Talk you of young Master Launcelot?	shakespearean
I have a good reason to cry, but my heart will splinter into a hundred thousand pieces before I let myself cry.—Oh, Fool, I’ll go mad!	modern
And you have to cut this flesh from his chest.	modern
A many of our bodies shall no doubt Find native graves, upon the which, I trust, Shall witness live in brass of this day’s work.	shakespearean
That big ship over there looks no bigger	modern
And say besides that in Aleppo once, Where a malignant and a turbaned Turk Beat a Venetian and traduced the state, I took by the throat the circumcisèd dog, And smote him, thus.	shakespearean
You’re lucky, my lord, to be able to see the peace and sweetness even in what bad luck has brought you.	modern
Who sent you here?	modern
She’s crying.	modern
See, ladies, how they scorn me now.	modern
The word is too good to paint out her wickedness.	shakespearean
There, Diomed, there.	shakespearean
Twenty thousand crowns now, and half my lands after my death.	modern
I will find the time to cry for you, Cassius, I’ll find the time.	modern
Why do you want to do that, my lord?	modern
I’ll do that.	modern
The sight made me so sick I couldn’t watch any more.	modern
Yes, my lord, if you would like.	modern
Look, Don Pedro is returned to seek you.	shakespearean
Can’t you see I’m eating?	modern
Don’t harp on that point, madam—it’s past.	modern
Now I must To the young man send humble treaties, dodge And palter in the shifts of lowness, who With half the bulk o’ th’ world played as I pleased, Making and marring fortunes.	shakespearean
What’s that trumpet?	modern
His discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valor, for the goose carries not the fox.	shakespearean
They saw him just now as mad and deranged as the stormy sea, singing loudly, wearing a crown of nettles, thorns, hemlock, and all the other weeds that grow in our cornfields.—Send out a hundred soldiers to find him.	modern
Your reason.	shakespearean
Sir, I think I saw him last night.	modern
Yet it was said It should not stand in thy posterity, But that myself should be the root and father Of many kings.	shakespearean
But make amends now.	shakespearean
Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!	shakespearean
If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius, He should not humor me.	shakespearean
Here comes young Master Ganymede, my new mistress’s brother.	shakespearean
He loves me well, and I have given him reasons.	shakespearean
Go, lad, and take them to the pantry.	modern
I tried to stop speaking plainly, since you dislike plain speech so much.	modern
Thou say’st the king grows mad.	shakespearean
Has he taken care of the music?	modern
I look forward to that present.	modern
Hastings loved the prince’s father so much that we won’t be able to persuade him to do anything against the prince.	modern
Did she give up all those chances to marry noblemen, give up her father and country and friends, just to be called a whore?	modern
Nah, I don’t care what their	modern
Thank God, thank God!	modern
Is there anything offensive in it?	modern
Well, honor is the subject of my story.	shakespearean
You talk to him, ma'am.	modern
Tis a strange serpent.	shakespearean
I am sorry I beat thee.	shakespearean
But did you not request to have it cut?	shakespearean
I enchanted them so thoroughly that they followed me through thorn bushes and prickly shrubs that tore up their shins.	modern
O, rejoice Beyond a common joy, and set it down With gold on lasting pillars.	shakespearean
But a stronger pity, for the wrongs committed against Rome, drove out our pity for Caesar, as fire drives out fire, and so we killed him.	modern
We’ll be there.	modern
Do you hear aught, sir, of a battle toward?	shakespearean
I’ll tell you as soon as I know, Richard, because at this point I have no idea.	modern
O brave touch!	shakespearean
When storms arrive early, you can expect the harvest will be damaged.	modern
Go ahead, Moon.	modern
Oh, madam, madam, madam!	modern
None that I more love than myself.	shakespearean
What, will our mother come?	shakespearean
Macbeth will never be defeated until Birnam Wood marches to fight you at Dunsinane Hill.	modern
Ah, how pitiful!	modern
My mind hath been as big as one of yours, My heart as great, my reason haply more, To bandy word for word and frown for frown.	shakespearean
I promise you, my soul is very jocund In the remembrance of so fair a dream.	shakespearean
Why should that name be sounded more than yours?	shakespearean
O ceremony, show me but thy worth!	shakespearean
He’ll go back to his Egyptian dish.	modern
Oh, when she had writ it and was reading it over, she found “Benedick” and “Beatrice” between the sheet?	shakespearean
My lord, you used to like me.	modern
Behold the threaden sails, Borne with th' invisible and creeping wind, Draw the huge bottoms through the furrowed sea, Breasting the lofty surge.	shakespearean
It turns kings into gods and men of lower rank into kings.	modern
I was his daughter when your Highness took my father’s dukedom.	modern
That is the voice, Or I am much deceived, of Portia.	shakespearean
Order him to advance his forces first thing, and we’ll follow.	modern
By my troth, my lord, I cannot tell what to think of it, but that she loves him with an enraged affection, it is past the infinite of thought.	shakespearean
Minion, thou liest.	shakespearean
What is it thou didst say?	shakespearean
Sister, it is not a little I have to say of what most nearly appertains to us both.	shakespearean
Then what’s Antony?	modern
Time, you thwart my dreadful plans.	modern
Would I were assured Of my condition.	shakespearean
He’s a king, a king!	modern
Withdraw thee, wretched Margaret.	shakespearean
I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.	shakespearean
What an idiot this guy is!—You’re a rotten piece of work!—I beg your highness, beat him up and take his wine bottle from him.	modern
Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous, Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls That welcome wrongs.	shakespearean
I therefore vouch again That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood Or with some dram, conjured to this effect, He wrought upon her.	shakespearean
You hear him all night.	shakespearean
We have store to do ’t, And they have earned the waste.	shakespearean
There is no more to say?	shakespearean
Well, it doesn’t matter.	modern
Didn’t I?	modern
Fare you well.	shakespearean
So much for this, sir.	shakespearean
Why, there, there, there, there!	shakespearean
Watch Cassius.	modern
I won’t betray them.	modern
Damn you for mocking me.	modern
As for the rest of the ships, I scattered them, and they’ve gathered again in the Mediterranean, sailing sadly home to Naples, believing that they witnessed the shipwreck and death of their great king.	modern
You can’t trust anyone who abuses her own father, her flesh and blood.	modern
I don’t know what to say.	modern
You must not think then that I am drunk.	shakespearean
And thou unfit for any place but hell.	shakespearean
That it was, sir.	modern
O fair Katherine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue.	shakespearean
How are you, my friend?	modern
Art thou thus boldened, man, by thy distress Or else a rude despiser of good manners, That in civility thou seem’st so empty?	shakespearean
Unless my horse goes faster than expected, I will be back an hour or two after sunset.	modern
Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?	shakespearean
Indeed, before you arrived here, old Siward, with ten thousand soldiers already prepared for battle, was making his way here.	modern
No going then!	shakespearean
There’s good reason to escape when there’s no mercy to be found anymore.	modern
He shall in time be ready.	shakespearean
Let’s go.	modern
Moneys is your suit.	shakespearean
But she has had prayers read for her and is dressed up like a pure virgin, with flowers tossed on her grave and the bell tolling for her.	modern
Don’t tell us what our duty is.	modern
To him will I.	shakespearean
Nathaniel’s coat, sir, was not fully made, And Gabriel’s pumps were all unpinked i' th' heel.	shakespearean
Strike alarum, drums!	shakespearean
Their sweet smells come from those little freckles.	modern
Stop right there!	modern
Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile.	shakespearean
Stay yet.	shakespearean
As for Hamlet and his attentions to you, just consider it a big flirtation, the temporary phase of a hot-blooded youth.	modern
I’m hanging on every word.	modern
How now, masters?	shakespearean
What wouldst thou, fellow?	shakespearean
We have not spoke us yet of torchbearers.	shakespearean
You shall not seal to such a bond for me!	shakespearean
I’ve spelled it out for you clearly.	modern
Pray God your wife doesn’t send you a worse one.	modern
Why, to put ’s head in—not to give it away to his daughters and leave his horns without a case.	shakespearean
The original story was written in the finest Italian.	modern
You must not look so sour.	shakespearean
Bring it to that, The gold I give thee will I melt and pour Down thy ill-uttering throat.	shakespearean
Oh, you bloody prison, fatal and threatening to noble lords!	modern
I love you the better; the hearers may cry “Amen.” God match me with a good dancer!	shakespearean
Get out of my sight!	modern
Dear general, I never gave you any reason to hate me.	modern
If he do blench, I know my course.	shakespearean
She is stirring, sir.	shakespearean
Poor Tom will take you there.	modern
Here, sweet lord, at your service.	shakespearean
Ask your daughters for another one.	modern
Let’s listen to him.	modern
Come, “The croaking raven doth bellow for revenge—”	shakespearean
No, for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that does those things.	shakespearean
Here’s some money for you.	modern
Do you know them?	shakespearean
No, cousin, I’ll to Fife.	shakespearean
I like you guys.	modern
Very pleased to meet you, my lord.	modern
May the tongues of our critics rot!	modern
Thou speak’st aright.	shakespearean
This health to Lepidus!	shakespearean
But honestly, I should have been a woman.	modern
When was the last time you saw my father?	modern
I tell you I requested that your master cut out the gown, but I didn’t ask him to cut it all to pieces.	modern
The only profit I seek is a peaceful match.	modern
Unknit that threat'ning unkind brow And dart not scornful glances from those eyes To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor.	shakespearean
Methinks it is like a weasel.	shakespearean
A deed that will make sick men healthy.	modern
Oh, what a bloody end to all this!	modern
God’s will, I pray thee wish not one man more.	shakespearean
Oh no!	modern
But there’s more work to be done.	modern
But you must learn to recognize such liars, or you will be greatly taken advantage of.	modern
What does she say, madam interpreter?	modern
Which one of them should I pick?	modern
Welcome, welcome to all of you.	modern
You’re a king’s advisor.	modern
The queen drinks to your good luck and happiness, Hamlet.	modern
One stroke Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest.	shakespearean
First, I ask you what they’ve done; thirdly, I ask you what offense they’re charged with; sixth and lastly, I ask you why they’ve been committed here; and, in conclusion, I ask what they’re accused of.	modern
By the apostle Paul, shadows tonight Have struck more terror to the soul of Richard Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers Armed in proof and led by shallow Richmond.	shakespearean
Therefore, patiently and yielding.	shakespearean
Do not you love me?	shakespearean
When he opens his wallet to give us our pay, your conscience will fly out?	modern
I’ll think over what you’ve said, I’ll listen patiently to whatever else you have to say, and I’ll find a good time for us to discuss further such weighty matters.	modern
It’s yours, and you may hang us, your trophies of war, anywhere you like.	modern
Because, look you, you do not love it, nor your affections and your appetites and your digestions does not agree with it, I would desire you to eat it.	shakespearean
The Jew will have justice.	modern
I “an itching palm”!	shakespearean
Follow not.	shakespearean
Not so, neither.	shakespearean
Let her not walk i' th' sun.	shakespearean
I’ll yield him thee asleep, Where thou mayst knock a nail into his head.	shakespearean
Marry, God defend his grace should say us nay!	shakespearean
Yours are slow and awkward.	modern
Now quit you well.—             Torches, torches!	shakespearean
What is it, Laertes?	modern
But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame, My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys Till that my nails were anchored in thine eyes, And I, in such a desp'rate bay of death, Like a poor bark of sails and tackling reft, Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom.	shakespearean
Tis fit we understand them.	shakespearean
But you’ve raised me as a peasant, hiding from me what I needed to become a gentleman.	modern
Now they’ve turned around and are clearly heading for Cyprus.	modern
There’s no other shelter around here.	modern
Shall we clap into ’t roundly, without hawking or spitting or saying we are hoarse, which are the only prologues to a bad voice?	shakespearean
Listen to my excuse.	modern
I have it on me here.	modern
Marry, it is your brother’s right hand.	shakespearean
O my good master!	shakespearean
Good faith, a little one, not past a pint, As I am a soldier.	shakespearean
Tell me your secrets.	modern
Our enemies have beat us to the pit.	shakespearean
I spoke with a Frenchman yesterday who said that a Venetian ship loaded with treasure was wrecked in the English Channel.	modern
See how he stands between two clergymen!	modern
Whip him.	shakespearean
Not I, my lord, by heaven.	shakespearean
Good morning, Benedick.	modern
I’ll have nothing to do with you.	modern
I just did my duty, sir.	modern
So he laughed and let me go.	shakespearean
He did comply, sir, with his dug before he sucked it.	shakespearean
You evil whore!	modern
Take thy forfeiture.	shakespearean
I’d like to munch on some good dry oats.	modern
Yes, sir.	modern
Thrice he walked By their oppressed and fear-surprisèd eyes Within his truncheon’s length, whilst they, distilled Almost to jelly with the act of fear, Stand dumb and speak not to him.	shakespearean
I will confess it to all the world.	modern
I will plague them all, Even to roaring.	shakespearean
Blow the trumpets.	modern
Then I’ll see you again?	modern
The ambassadors are back from Norway, sir.	modern
That’s true, sir.	modern
Mistress, we have.	shakespearean
I’ll do it.	modern
I repeat, spread the rumor that Anne, my wife, is sick and likely to die.	modern
Not a jot more, my lord.	shakespearean
What a foolish duty call you this?	shakespearean
Still be ’t yours.	shakespearean
They were suborned.	shakespearean
Yea, wherefore should she not?	shakespearean
I will speak lower.	shakespearean
What did I do?	modern
I want to do a little good despite my evil nature.	modern
I think he would not wish himself anywhere but where he is.	shakespearean
No, I’m as honest as I am Christian.	modern
Alack, poor gentleman!	shakespearean
That’s how I always do it, getting money from fools.	modern
I know a thousand immature tricks like that, and I’ll use them all.	modern
Hello, sir.	modern
Absolutely, yes indeed.	modern
But if you fail, you have to leave immediately.	modern
I wish mine eyes Would with themselves shut up my thoughts.	shakespearean
What would you like, Laertes?	modern
You smiled with a strength you must have gotten from heaven, while I cried salty tears into the salty sea, and groaned at our situation.	modern
Where are you, Pindarus?	modern
You shall, Mark Antony.	shakespearean
No braver than this?	modern
Oh, I wish you’d never been born!	modern
The humiliation is all mine.	modern
O sirs, consider: they that set you on To do this deed will hate you for the deed.	shakespearean
There must be conclusions.	shakespearean
Twill be ill taken.	shakespearean
Let rivers flood and fiends howl for food!	modern
We’ll bury him, and then, what’s brave, what’s noble, Let’s do ’t after the high Roman fashion And make death proud to take us.	shakespearean
Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting?	shakespearean
I’ll go now to find out the date of the wedding.	modern
If he be sad, he wants money.	shakespearean
Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou, thus to rail on one that is neither known of thee nor knows thee!	shakespearean
I think our father will hence tonight.	shakespearean
What other rites are you going to give her?	modern
The quality of mercy is not strained.	shakespearean
You shall have letters from me to my son In your behalf, to meet you on the way.	shakespearean
What are you doing?	modern
O bitter consequence That Edward still should live “true noble prince”!	shakespearean
But once he got there, the duke learned that Lorenzo and his lover Jessica were together in a gondola.	modern
If it’s okay with you, you should not press your grievances any further, but realize that the current situation should be enough to reconcile you.	modern
Did I do anything good to myself?	modern
Oh, ’tis foul in her.	shakespearean
I do beseech your Grace to pardon me, and withal Forbear your conference with the noble duke.	shakespearean
Yes, boy.	modern
No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.	shakespearean
So, to answer your question.	modern
To the tuition of God.	shakespearean
Caesar should be a beast without a heart If he should stay at home today for fear.	shakespearean
The British powers are marching hitherward.	shakespearean
Go tell your generals to hurry their preparations.	modern
It’s only four o'clock now.	modern
He’s worth more sorrow, And that I’ll spend for him.	shakespearean
Are you in your right mind?	modern
I’d rather die in a ditch in Egypt, and make it my gentle grave.	modern
Approach the chamber, and destroy your sight With a new Gorgon.	shakespearean
This is thy office.	shakespearean
I think he only loves life because of Bassanio.	modern
Therefore the dukes of Berri, Bretagne, Brabant, and Orléans shall advance, and you, Prince Dauphin, will swiftly entrench and fortify our fortress towns with men of courage and the means to defend themselves.	modern
Well then, he’s God’s soldier now!	modern
I would it might be hangers till then.	shakespearean
And that most deeply to consider is The beauty of his daughter.	shakespearean
You shall not find, Though you be therein curious, the least cause For what you seem to fear.	shakespearean
And when shalt thou see him again?	shakespearean
Nothing, madam.	shakespearean
Shake off sleep, which looks like death, and look at death itself!	modern
He has almost supped.	shakespearean
Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts.	shakespearean
When you are gentle, you shall have one too, And not till then.	shakespearean
That, being mad herself, she’s madly mated.	shakespearean
My brother Gloucester’s voice.—Ay, I know thy errand.	shakespearean
Come on, relax, dear.	modern
I think he’ll carry this island home in his pocket and give it to his son like an apple.	modern
If my lips had the power to give life, I would wear them out like this.	modern
You can hope your father isn’t your real father.	modern
Idle old man That still would manage those authorities That he hath given away!	shakespearean
Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?	shakespearean
My pretty children, both of you misunderstand me.	modern
What soldiers, fool?	modern
Lord Hastings, will you go with me?	modern
What a fool I’ve been!	modern
She’s not feeling well.	modern
And having brought our treasure where we will, Then take we down his load and turn him off, Like to the empty ass, to shake his ears And graze in commons.	shakespearean
Pretty lady, I’m much ashamed of your shocking behavior.	modern
Is thy master stirring?	shakespearean
Please, your Grace, tell me what crime I have committed.	modern
O Antony, O thou Arabian bird!	shakespearean
Were you thinking of spending the night here?	modern
See, see, our honored hostess!	shakespearean
And since we dream at night, time passes quickly then.	modern
He tells me flatly there is no mercy for me in heaven because I am a Jew’s daughter, and he says you are no good member of the commonwealth, for in converting Jews to Christians you raise the price of pork.	shakespearean
God keep me so.—Heralds, go with him.	modern
I didn’t realize he knew her.	modern
Oh, the poor bird.	modern
Right on cue.	modern
As they pass by, grab Casca by the sleeve, and he’ll tell you if anything important happened today—in his usual sour way.	modern
Two nights together had these gentlemen, Marcellus and Barnardo, on their watch, In the dead waste and middle of the night, Been thus encountered: a figure like your father, Armed at point exactly, cap-à-pie, Appears before them and with solemn march Goes slow and stately by them.	shakespearean
There’s only one body here.	modern
Of the king’s ship, The mariners, say how thou hast disposed, And all the rest o' th' fleet.	shakespearean
What is the matter?	shakespearean
It’s my duty, sir.	modern
May God be at your table.	modern
He hath disgraced me and hindered me half a million, laughed at my losses, mocked at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine enemies—and what’s his reason?	shakespearean
Please don’t be angry.	modern
Therefore go.	shakespearean
But I might see young Cupid’s fiery shaft Quenched in the chaste beams of the watery moon, And the imperial votaress passèd on, In maiden meditation, fancy-free.	shakespearean
And so will I.	shakespearean
This is not a maiden, as you say, but an old man—wrinkled, faded, and withered.	modern
And from hence I go To make these doubts all even.	shakespearean
I dreamed the souls of the people Richard murdered came to my tent and promised me victory.	modern
I didn’t refuse you.	modern
I am glad he’s come, howsoe'er he comes.	shakespearean
to have a stupid wife.	modern
If she feels like coming over here, I’ll give her your message.	modern
Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile, And touch thy instrument a strain or two?	shakespearean
Why, this is not Lear.	shakespearean
When he raised his arm in command, the world trembled.	modern
Where is that poor rash man?	modern
Don’t tone things down or exaggerate them out of hostility.	modern
If they could purge their guilt simply by saying that they were innocent, they’d all be as innocent as God Himself.	modern
I should have waited to tell you my news.	modern
So you took pleasure in bringing me this message?	modern
This is Caesar you’re looking at.	modern
Come, bring me unto my chance.	shakespearean
Ay, but (by your leave) not before me.	shakespearean
Tush, tush, man, never fleer and jest at me.	shakespearean
Well, I recognize this one  Good God!	modern
Hoppedance cries in Tom’s belly for two white herring.	shakespearean
Brutus” will start a spirit as soon as “Caesar.” Now in the names of all the gods at once, Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed That he is grown so great?	shakespearean
What would you, Desdemona?	shakespearean
Here an angel’s lying in a golden bed.—Give me the key.	modern
Therefore, accept my everlasting farewell.	modern
Therefore, every soldier should do as any man who is sick in his bed would do: clear his conscience of any stain.	modern
The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for Cyprus.	shakespearean
You are only a soldier.	modern
How came you to this?	shakespearean
Will you go?	shakespearean
It may be, these apparent prodigies, The unaccustomed terror of this night, And the persuasion of his augurers May hold him from the Capitol today.	shakespearean
The noble Brutus told you that Caesar was ambitious.	modern
This accident is not unlike my dream, Belief of it oppresses me already.	shakespearean
Besides, his cottage, his flocks, and his grazing rights are on sale now, and since he’s not there, there’s nothing to eat at our house.	modern
Sir, she can turn, and turn, and yet go on, And turn again.	shakespearean
Hillo, ho, ho, boy.	shakespearean
The Lord keep him from the title of king!	modern
Am I all alone?	modern
You’d better go inside.	modern
Make those that do offend you suffer too.	shakespearean
While that the armèd hand doth fight abroad, Th' advisèd head defends itself at home.	shakespearean
Thou art a lady.	shakespearean

How intend you, “practiced”?	shakespearean
He was crazy to run away.	modern
Macduff is missing, and your noble son.	shakespearean
What need the bridge much broader than the flood?	shakespearean
I’m warning you.	modern
Do you think so?	modern
To bed, to bed.	shakespearean
I will not stay behind.	shakespearean
Corporal Nym, be a man and put away your sword.	modern
You’re acting stupid, Casca, and you lack the quick wits that a Roman should have—or else you don’t use them.	modern
What, are we playing with interjections?	modern
Is it even so?	shakespearean
It’s leaping about like a frisky horse.	modern
It would be a pretty stingy love if it could be counted and calculated.	modern
Meanwhile I’ll stay with Regan with my hundred knights.	modern
That’s the right attitude.	modern
I have a file Of all the gentry.	shakespearean
Richard Earl of Cambridge, I arrest you for high treason.	modern
I’ll take the banner from a trumpeter and use that.	modern
You don’t need it yet.	modern
If there’s any doubt, there is no doubt.	modern
Hie you, Messala, And I will seek for Pindarus the while.	shakespearean
I have within my mind A thousand raw tricks of these bragging jacks Which I will practice.	shakespearean
It nothing ill becomes thee.— Aboard my galley I invite you all.	shakespearean
So Fulvia told me.	shakespearean
Thy dæmon—that thy spirit which keeps thee—is Noble, courageous, high, unmatchable Where Caesar’s is not.	shakespearean
Make sure everyone knows that.	modern
No, lad.	shakespearean
But for one reason they refused to execute her.	modern
For I mine own gained knowledge should profane If I would time expend with such a snipe But for my sport and profit.	shakespearean
Therefore, love and tongue-tied simplicity can say the most even when they’re saying the least, in my opinion.	modern
Madam, I’ll take my leave.	shakespearean
Look, sir, I bleed.	shakespearean
My banquet is to close our stomachs up, After our great good cheer.	shakespearean
And lovers' hours are a hundred and sixty times longer than normal ones!	modern
Here at your service.	shakespearean
And if it stand, as you yourself still do, Within the eye of honor, be assured My purse, my person, my extremest means Lie all unlocked to your occasions.	shakespearean
It never ceases to amaze me the way people ignore the correct, traditional principles and rules of war.	modern
Tis a match.	shakespearean
I could cure you, if you just called me Rosalind and came by my cottage every day to woo me.	modern
Most kind messenger, Say to great Caesar this in deputation: I kiss his conqu’ring hand.	shakespearean
The king performs more wonders than seem humanly possible, challenging every enemy he sees.	modern
Some villain has told lies about me.	modern
It was a rough night.	modern
Why are they running away?	modern
A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross.	shakespearean
What, go you toward the Tower?	shakespearean
You shall try but one fall.	shakespearean
Oh, whither hast thou led me, Egypt?	shakespearean
Not know me yet?	shakespearean
In two months—a month before this loan is due—I expect to earn more than three times that much from my investments.	modern
Let him go up into the public chair.	shakespearean
Even if I have to die—as they threaten—I have to help the king.	modern
Tis gone.	shakespearean
But I pray you commend my counterfeiting to him.	shakespearean
So please your grace, the Prologue is addressed.	shakespearean
It is enacted in the laws of Venice, If it be proved against an alien That by direct or indirect attempts He seek the life of any citizen, The party 'gainst the which he doth contrive Shall seize one half his goods.	shakespearean
Who put my servant in the stocks?	modern
You’ll grant me, you hedgehog?	modern
I like you lads.	shakespearean
Invoke his warlike spirit and that of Edward the Black Prince, your great-uncle, who fought a tragic battle on French soil, routing the French army in full force while his mighty father stood by on a hilltop, smiling to see his son steeped in the blood of French noblemen.	modern
No, no, he’s dead.	modern
May we do so?	shakespearean
If it looks like my good father, I’ll speak to it, even if Hell itself opens up and tells me to be quiet.	modern
And the tears of it are wet.	shakespearean
No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favored, for honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar.	shakespearean
Oh, he has given example for our flight Most grossly by his own!	shakespearean
For if the Jew do cut but deep enough, I’ll pay it presently with all my heart.	shakespearean
Thank you for his present and your trouble.	modern
him terribly.	modern
The duke will agree with me on that.	modern
But while thou livest, keep a good tongue in thy head.	shakespearean
But, mistress, know yourself.	shakespearean
Hopefully, your wedding day is only postponed.	modern
Undress the statues if they’re decorated in honor of Caesar.	modern
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it, As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?	shakespearean
Thus Rosalind of many parts By heavenly synod was devised, Of many faces, eyes, and hearts To have the touches dearest prized.	shakespearean
I have news, ma'am.	modern
My sweet darling cries when she sees me work and tells me that such a wonderful man never performed such lowly tasks before.	modern
I’m dying an innocent woman.	modern
Wherefore do you come?	shakespearean
Let’s look in his pockets.	modern
All things are ready if our minds be so.	shakespearean
Your highness, I want nothing more than what you’ve already offered.	modern
Did you send to him, sir?	shakespearean
When you ask for my blessing, I’ll get down on my knees and ask you to forgive me.	modern
Therefore, my sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be merry.	shakespearean
How now, sirrah!	shakespearean
But if you fail, without more speech, my lord, You must be gone from hence immediately.	shakespearean
From this moment on I have a higher opinion of you than before.	modern
Pour in sow’s blood, that hath eaten Her nine farrow; grease that’s sweaten From the murderer’s gibbet throw Into the flame.	shakespearean

It fell upon a little western flower, Before milk-white, now purple with love’s wound.	shakespearean
The thoughts of people.	shakespearean
Shall we their fond pageant see?	shakespearean
Some villains in my court must have known about this and let it happen.	modern
Oh, my heart, my heart is rising into my throat!	modern
I just speak directly.	modern
If thou beest as poor for a subject as he’s for a king, thou'rt poor enough.	shakespearean
I know you are of her bosom.	shakespearean
How cheerest thou, Jessica?	shakespearean
I shall never see my gold again.	shakespearean
Go a little before.	shakespearean
By all means.	modern
Well, you know he sometimes walks here in the lobby for four hours at a time.	modern
These chatty fellows who can rhyme their way into a lady’s good graces always reason themselves out again.	modern
Did you hit your head?	modern
What seems sweet to him now will soon turn bitter.	modern
But let me to my fortune and the caskets.	shakespearean
They never meet but there’s a skirmish of wit between them.	shakespearean
I have brought you from Venice.	shakespearean
You have lost no reputation at all unless you repute yourself such a loser.	shakespearean
If he say so, may his pernicious soul Rot half a grain a day!	shakespearean
Noblest of men, woo’t die?	shakespearean
My good lord, I still need you to like me.	modern
Still the same old Cassius!	modern
Only one man in ten thousand is good in this world.	modern
And second father This lady makes him to me.	shakespearean
The dew is raw and cold.	shakespearean
Good e'en, good e'en.	shakespearean
Alas, I hate myself instead, because of the hateful deeds I’ve committed.	modern
Watch him closely.	modern
And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of holy bread.	shakespearean
Eternity was in our lips and eyes, Bliss in our brows’ bent, none our parts so poor But was a race of heaven.	shakespearean
Ay, and a kind one too.	shakespearean
I think we are too bold upon your rest.	shakespearean
Caesar’s will?	shakespearean
They really wish they were somewhere else, but they want to descend on us, looking fierce so we’ll think they’re brave.	modern
Well, it’s as plain as the beaten path to a parish church.	modern
Did you confer with him?	shakespearean
He who chooses me must give and risk all he has.” Must give everything—for what?	modern
There comes an old man and his three sons— I could match this beginning with an old tale.	shakespearean
I’m your little dog, Demetrius.	modern
Well, take him on up and we’ll try to pull it off.	modern
Now he lies there worth nothing, and no one is so humble as to show him respect.	modern
Yes, my lord.	modern
Twas a color he never liked.	shakespearean
Let’s draw our own swords too.	modern
Sweet Beatrice, wouldst thou come when I called thee?	shakespearean
I’ll kill myself out of grief!	modern
These are gracious drops.	shakespearean
Be wary, then.	shakespearean
Thus with imagined wing our swift scene flies In motion of no less celerity Than that of thought.	shakespearean
Getting right to the point, I live near the Capitol.	modern
That’s why I’ve begged him to come on our shift tonight, so that if the ghost appears he can see what we see and speak to it.	modern
Why do they run away?	shakespearean
Captain Macmorris, when there is more better opportunity to be required, look you, I will be so bold as to tell you I know the disciplines of war, and there is an end.	shakespearean
Here comes Sir Oliver.	modern
I know it’s foolish to be so much in love, but I can’t help it.	modern
Do you remember the circumstances?	modern
Tis time to look about.	shakespearean
If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye, I can tell who should down.	shakespearean
Here he comes, and the Scots captain, Captain Jamy, with him.	shakespearean
Yes, that’s the one.	modern
Tell him to bring his pen and his inkwell to the jail.	modern
Everything except something to live on.	modern
What’s that, I pray?	shakespearean
Meanwhile, we’re the ones who need you.	modern
Good to see you, Signior Hortensio.	modern
I wish your Highness knew my true feelings in this matter: I have never in my life loved my brother.	modern
He’s left them to you and to your heirs forever—public pleasures in which you will be able to stroll and relax.	modern
Will you lead, lords?	shakespearean
And where’s Cordelia?— Do you see this, Kent?	modern
You liar, you’re turning my heart to stone, and making me call what I’ll do murder, when I had been thinking of it as a sacrifice!	modern
Return to her, and fifty men dismissed?	shakespearean
I’ll tell her.	modern
Well,        Aren’t I right, Jephthah, old man?	modern
Why did you leave the dining room?	modern
Where’s my fool, ho?	shakespearean
I’m very afraid of Banquo.	modern
And what about him, Tranio?	modern
Let’s not, Brutus.	modern
A dollar.	shakespearean
Your preparation for war sounds like something.	modern
Will you pleasure me?	shakespearean
Damn your wine!	modern
Oh no, good Cassio!	modern
Right true it is your son Lucentio here Doth love my daughter and she loveth him, Or both dissemble deeply their affections.	shakespearean
In a way” is the right way to go.	modern

Once he’s carried our treasure where we want it, we’ll free him of the load and turn him loose like a jackass, to shake his ears and graze in the public pastures.	modern
Oh, horror, horror, horror!	modern
My love doth so approve him That even his stubbornness, his checks, his frowns— Prithee, unpin me—have grace and favor.	shakespearean
Maybe they call me that because I am cheerful.	modern
No masque tonight.	shakespearean
A Cornish name.	shakespearean
Is it time, my Lord Constable?	modern
How can you ever hope for mercy for yourself, when you don’t give any now?	modern
I mean, sir, for his weapon.	shakespearean
The smell of leek turns my stomach.	modern
Has he, sirs?	modern
I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.	shakespearean
O, sir, the conceit is deeper than you think for.	shakespearean
Bloodshed will force you to.	modern
So go away.	modern

Oh, it was a monstrous roar, to make the earth tremble!	modern
Monster, come, put some lime upon your fingers, and away with the rest.	shakespearean
Cassio’s been wounded.	modern
For assuredly, you are so near the abyss that you’re bound to be swallowed up.	modern
Moon and stars!	shakespearean
Some such squire he was That turned your wit the seamy side without And made you to suspect me with the Moor.	shakespearean
Well, we will leave you then till dinnertime.	shakespearean
Oh, how awful that a lady who’s been rejected by one man should therefore be treated horribly by another one!	modern
But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies have lost?	shakespearean
Your sweet brother wanted to come meet you, but his mother wouldn’t let him.	modern
It won’t go on.	modern
So please your Lordship to accept our duty.	shakespearean
She’s dead, I think.—Help, uncle!—Hero, why Hero!	modern

Tis true.	shakespearean
I think I’m getting delirious.	modern
Oh, by whom?	shakespearean
Well, until that time, don’t come near me.	modern
Why, dear me, Kate!	modern
They’re out to get me, and I won’t stand for it!	modern

For God’s sake, a pot of small ale.	shakespearean
What stay had we but Clarence?	shakespearean
As ignorant as dirt!	shakespearean
You take my house away when you take the money I need for upkeep.	modern
Well, eventually God will send him some more hair, if he thanks Him.	modern
I can’t admit that, since you’d have to compare his excellence to mine.	modern
It would be smart to offer someone poor and innocent like me as a sacrificial lamb to satisfy an angry god like Macbeth.	modern
That was when I was young and inexperienced and didn’t know what passion was.	modern
That useless old man still thinks he can wield all the powers he’s given away.	modern
Aren’t I your Rosalind?	modern
Thank you, doctor.	modern
I can see yet without spectacles, and I see no such matter.	shakespearean
This, this.	shakespearean
I have been up this hour, awake all night.	shakespearean
Then, with your will, go on.	shakespearean

I am very glad to see you.	shakespearean
Hurry up, Robin, and make the night dark and cloudy.	modern
And Cassio’s killed?	modern
Macbeth shall never vanquished be until Great Birnam Wood to high Dunsinane Hill Shall come against him.	shakespearean

If you forgive my mistake, I swear I’ll never break an oath with you again.	modern
God be with you and keep you, and may he heal your head.	modern

Rosalind of a better leer than you.	shakespearean
Goodbye, then.	modern
What do you mean by that?	modern
So you’re saying you’re not a whore?	modern
I love you so much that I’ll send your soul to heaven very soon—if heaven will accept anything from me, that is.	modern
Awaken the memory of those valiant ancestors and with your own powerful arm make their deeds live again.	modern
No, by this hand.	shakespearean
Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?	shakespearean
And do you mean what you’re saying, Gratiano?	modern
Do you need something?	modern
Many a man his life hath sold But my outside to behold.	shakespearean
I’m not dead?	modern

Hold then my sword and turn away thy face While I do run upon it.	shakespearean
Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting That would not let me sleep.	shakespearean
I won’t bet on whether or not any of this is real.	modern
No marvel then, though he were ill affected.	shakespearean
O Pomfret, Pomfret!	shakespearean

See better, Lear, and let me still remain The true blank of thine eye.	shakespearean
And he had a chain that once belonged to you hanging around his neck.	modern
Phoebe did write it.	shakespearean
Well, well, away.	shakespearean
How dost thou, Charles?	shakespearean
Say ’tis not so, a province I will give thee And make thy fortunes proud.	shakespearean
These are the messengers from my sister and the king.	modern
Art thou indeed?	shakespearean
He might have treated me like that, because I’m as unused to abuse as a little child.	modern
Parted you in good terms?	shakespearean
The thought whereof Doth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards, And nothing can or shall content my soul Till I am evened with him, wife for wife.	shakespearean
I’ve never seen a creature with a human shape who was so eager to destroy a man.	modern
She is low-voiced.	shakespearean
Yes, it’s well built, and the ship’s pilot is very expert and experienced.	modern
So it appears by that I have to say.	shakespearean
Is not tomorrow, boy, the ides of March?	shakespearean
Now, my co-mates and brothers in exile, Hath not old custom made this life more sweet Than that of painted pomp?	shakespearean
What should I say to her?	modern
We’ll all want our fortune told.	modern
They were traitors!	shakespearean
She should have died hereafter.	shakespearean
Twenty crowns?	modern
As God is my witness, you know you’re mine.	modern
She give it Cassio?	shakespearean
The same liquor that quenched their thirst has fired me up.	modern
Tis two or three, my lord, that bring you word Macduff is fled to England.	shakespearean
You speak absolutely correctly, sir.	modern
Well, okay.—I swear to God, both their stories match.	modern
It doesn’t matter if it’s in tune so long as it’s loud enough.	modern
Hamlet.” This in obedience hath my daughter shown me, And more above, hath his solicitings, As they fell out by time, by means, and place, All given to mine ear.	shakespearean
So, so, so, so!	modern
And I have built Two chantries where the sad and solemn priests Sing still for Richard’s soul.	shakespearean
And before I make her normal again—I can cure her by treating her with another plant—I’ll make her give me that little boy as my page.	modern
I pray thee, bear my former answer back.	shakespearean
Where shall we go?	shakespearean
I thought he was just toying with you and meant to ruin your reputation.	modern
And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true.	shakespearean
Can I have a word with you, Lucillius?	modern
Now I am alone.	shakespearean
Our troops set forth tomorrow.	shakespearean
He saves my labor by his own approach.	shakespearean
I’m sorry I hit you.	modern
He is taking care of it as we speak.	modern
Treason and murder ever kept together As two yoke-devils sworn to either’s purpose, Working so grossly in a natural cause That admiration did not whoop at them.	shakespearean
I know him; he wears a lock.	shakespearean
Yes, yes.	modern
Oh, oh, oh!	modern
What does this mean, my lord?	shakespearean
Come on, let’s go see King Edward.	modern
Is it within reason and compass?	shakespearean
By the eighth hour.	shakespearean
It’s driven me crazy.	modern

Farewell, everyone.	shakespearean
Untimely comes this hurt.	shakespearean
You don’t love me.	modern

On me, that halts and am misshapen thus?	shakespearean
What is your difference?	shakespearean
But of that tomorrow, When therewithal we shall have cause of state Craving us jointly.	shakespearean
By foul play, as thou sayst, were we heaved thence, But blessedly holp hither.	shakespearean
And I know that by now they’re waiting for me on the porch outside Pompey’s theater.	modern
It was my magic that saved you when I arrived on the island and heard you, making the pine tree open and let you out.	modern
Twenty crowns?	shakespearean
Go, take it away and let your master make whatever use of it he can.	modern
But if I were smart enough to get out of this forest, I’d be wise enough to satisfy myself.	modern
This shall make Our purpose necessary and not envious, Which so appearing to the common eyes, We shall be called purgers, not murderers.	shakespearean
She’s no longer my daughter, and I’ll never see her face again.	modern
And Benedick is not the unhopefulest husband that I know.	shakespearean
Actually, I’m still feeling some pangs of conscience.	modern
Set your countenance, sir.	shakespearean
Before my God, I might not this believe Without the sensible and true avouch Of mine own eyes.	shakespearean
Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret me, yet you cannot play upon me.	shakespearean

Oh, traitors, villains!	modern
Cupid is a bad boy for making poor women go crazy like this.	modern
He’s offered me a lot of affection lately.	modern
Be brave and do well!	modern
I cannot hide what I am.	shakespearean
Here, sirrah Grumio.	shakespearean
Madam, we have to go: the Prince, the Count, Signior Benedick, Don John, and all the gentlemen of the town have come to bring you to church.	modern
I’m speaking purely in analogies and comparisons.	modern
Make yourself comfortable.	modern
Wait for me there.	modern
Tell him, if he comes here, I’ll explain everything to him and, on my word, he’ll leave unharmed.	modern
If not, leave me alone, and I’ll stay away from your turf.	modern
There lies your love.	shakespearean
And why do you blame me for loving you?	modern
What did he do to you?	modern
Those uncles that you wish were here were dangerous.	modern
The general speaks to you.	shakespearean
And whoever is most irritated by my foolishness has to laugh the hardest.	modern
He doth entreat your Grace, my noble lord, To visit him tomorrow or next day.	shakespearean
And when will that be?	modern
Yes, we talked for a couple of hours.	modern
Goodbye to the soldiers and to the wars that make men great!	modern
Make we our march towards Birnam.	shakespearean
And I for Ganymede.	shakespearean
O Cleopatra!	shakespearean
Come, come away.	shakespearean
How are you, Guildenstern?	modern
I led them on in this distracted fear And left sweet Pyramus translated there.	shakespearean
I find it still, when I have leave to sleep.	shakespearean
Yes, and be wise.	modern
For the one, I have neither words nor measure; and for the other, I have no strength in measure, yet a reasonable measure in strength.	shakespearean
How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?	shakespearean
I am not sick if Brutus have in hand Any exploit worthy the name of honor.	shakespearean
What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!	shakespearean
Stay down, heart.	modern
What does he say of Brutus?	shakespearean
Yes, but swear by my sword this time.	modern
Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee, and Requires to live in Egypt; which not granted, He lessens his requests, and to thee sues To let him breathe between the heavens and earth A private man in Athens.	shakespearean
If he’s never drunk it before, it’ll help soothe his fever.	modern
Why, well.	shakespearean
For the sake of your father’s memory, make peace.	modern
He looks angry.	modern
The Duke himself, Or any of my brothers of the state, Cannot but feel this wrong as ’twere their own.	shakespearean
Most kind messenger, tell great Caesar that through his deputy I kiss his conquering hand.	modern
Damn your stones for disappointing me like this!	modern
Then we can all three be comrades on our way to France.	modern
I will desire you to live in the meantime and eat your victuals.	shakespearean
O no, my reasons are too deep and dead— Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their graves.	shakespearean
Even for a  Good morning, lieutenant.	modern
You hit my servants, and your disorderly mob of knights treat their superiors like servants.	modern
The war’s over and the Turks are drowned.	modern
What, man?	shakespearean
Where’s that dog?	modern
Well, I’m sorry for your niece.	modern
I’ll listen to Brutus.	modern
I have walked around the streets, exposing myself to the perilous night, unbuttoned like this, as you see, Casca, baring my chest to the thunderbolt.	modern
Mistress, what cheer?	shakespearean
Go to hell, you whore!	modern
They are winged.	shakespearean
I have known when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife, and now had he rather hear the tabor and the pipe.	shakespearean
The clerk is answered.	shakespearean
Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she willfully seeks her own salvation?	shakespearean
Marry, we were sent for to the justices.	shakespearean
Their messengers are ready, waiting to deliver our response in these matters.	modern
Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once Had not concluded all.—He wakes.	shakespearean
Please wait, sir.	modern
If you’re a virgin, you’ll answer this question.	modern
This news will comfort Cassius.	modern
And then the moon, like to a silver bow New bent in heaven, shall behold the night Of our solemnities.	shakespearean
At Sardis once, And this last night here in Philippi fields.	shakespearean
Perchance, Iago, I will ne'er go home.	shakespearean
I will not confess it to you nor to anyone else, because there was no one else to witness her speech.	modern
Happy indeed, the way we have spent the day.	modern
Come, let’s all take hands Till that the conquering wine hath steeped our sense In soft and delicate Lethe.	shakespearean
Biondello, go and tell your mistress to come to me.	modern
I have more reason to be distressed.	modern
But those who understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads.	modern
Therefore my son i' th' ooze is bedded, and I’ll seek him deeper than e'er plummet sounded And with him there lie mudded.	shakespearean
Listen to this.	modern
Contending with the fretful elements.	shakespearean
Did not you tell me I should know the man By the Athenian garment he had on?	shakespearean
It’s like a monster that just grows and grows, out of nothing.	modern
Ask this man’s forgiveness, love him, and accept his offer.	modern
Monsieur the challenger, the Princess calls for you.	shakespearean
He’s a good man.	modern
It only stands Our lives upon to use our strongest hands.	shakespearean
O, this evil wind that spreads nothing but misery.	modern
If thou ask me why, sufficeth my reasons are both good and weighty.	shakespearean
And but my noble Moor Is true of mind and made of no such baseness As jealous creatures are, it were enough To put him to ill thinking.	shakespearean
Bring forth men-children only, For thy undaunted mettle should compose Nothing but males.	shakespearean
Oh, what a world is this when what is comely Envenoms him that bears it!	shakespearean
I’ve been informed by certain sources I can’t disclose that your younger brother Orlando plans to fight me in disguise.	modern
Helen, to you our minds we will unfold.	shakespearean
You take my life When you do take the means whereby I live.	shakespearean
Are they “informed” of this?	shakespearean
No, none at all.	modern
Yes, sir, we hope so.	modern
She is worse than wicked.	modern
Marry, on Hero, the daughter and heir of Leonato.	shakespearean
You know me well, and herein spend but time To wind about my love with circumstance.	shakespearean
I’m yours forever.	modern
Thou art a soldier only.	shakespearean
Stop it, I order you.	modern
Dost thou think I care for a satire or an epigram?	shakespearean
They sing when they die.	modern
He hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the Indies.	shakespearean
God forbid that I snatch the crown from him.	modern
Are you Tyrrel?	modern
Why, thy horn is a foot, and so long am I, at the least.	shakespearean
Therefore you must needs play Pyramus.	shakespearean
Amen to that, sweet powers!	shakespearean
If knives, poison, or snakes have edge, effect, or venom, I am safe from that fate.	modern
Rub his temples.	modern
Sure, I think so, And therefore certainly it were not good She knew his love, lest she make sport at it.	shakespearean
My wife was killed too?	modern
These recent eclipses of the sun and moon don’t bode well for us.	modern
And where’s Cordelia?— Seest thou this object, Kent?	shakespearean
And look, where Publius is come to fetch me.	shakespearean
What is it she does now?	shakespearean
O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early, Who, having some advantage on Octavius, Took it too eagerly.	shakespearean
You have the power to fix it.	modern
You can decide that privately.	modern
It becomes The thronèd monarch better than his crown.	shakespearean
I thank thee, master.	shakespearean
I swear that nothing anyone can say will change my mind.	modern
You may change your mind later.	modern
Next he slung his arm around the bride’s neck and kissed her with such a smack that when they parted the sound of their lips made the whole church echo.	modern
Go find him, please, and bring him to my tent.	modern
Too well, too well.	shakespearean
Why, that was he.	shakespearean
Is his ship sturdy?	modern
Look around you, Caesar.	modern
I am very ill at ease, Unfit for mine own purposes.	shakespearean
You have of late stood out against your brother, and he hath ta'en you newly into his grace, where it is impossible you should take true root but by the fair weather that you make yourself.	shakespearean
Farewell, farewell.	shakespearean
I wouldn’t have given it away for a whole jungle of monkeys.	modern
Petruchio, patience.	shakespearean
And when she was here recently she flirted with Edmund and gave him significant glances.	modern
The best I can, my lord.	shakespearean
You had rotten food, and he helped you eat it.	modern
Come forward and speak.	modern
If Cleopatra heard you, your reproof Were well deserved of rashness.	shakespearean
Enjoy your frankness; it suits you.	modern
This is the inventory of the money, silverware, dishes, and jewels that are still in my possession.	modern
Get up and tell me how you came here.	modern
I hope God keeps that monster from growing in Othello’s mind!	modern
Get out of here.	modern
I think few die well who die in battle.	modern
And to me, Denmark is a prison.	modern
A certain aim he took At a fair vestal thronèd by the west, And loosed his love shaft smartly from his bow As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts.	shakespearean
That thou shalt see the difference of our spirit, I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it.	shakespearean
I thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws of a lion.	shakespearean
He’s been killed.	modern
What good does heaven have in store that can do me any good now?	modern
And what’s he then that says I play the villain?	shakespearean
Grandmother, this would have been a biting joke.	modern
Go ahead and say you don’t love me, but not so bitterly.	modern
Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.” I will assume desert.—Give me a key for this, And instantly unlock my fortunes here.	shakespearean
And laid the love juice on some true love’s sight.	shakespearean
Be free and happy.	modern
What shall I do for you?	modern
But upon the fairest boughs, Or at every sentence end, Will I “Rosalinda” write, Teaching all that read to know The quintessence of every sprite Heaven would in little show.	shakespearean
Ay, his breast.	shakespearean
My services which I have done the signiory Shall out-tongue his complaints.	shakespearean
Not young enough to fall in love with a woman because she sings well, but not old enough to dote on a woman for any reason.	modern
Tis better, sir, to be brief than tedious.—Let him see our commission, and talk no more.	shakespearean
Tell them you know that Hero loves me.	modern
Oh, he’s returned, and as pleasant as ever he was.	shakespearean
Who am I then?	modern
Tis not a time for private stomaching.	shakespearean
Great thing of us forgot!— Speak, Edmund, where’s the king?	shakespearean
Where be thy tenants and thy followers?	shakespearean
Oh, damn, damn, damn!	modern
Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way Of starvèd people.	shakespearean
Death, in guerdon of her wrongs, Gives her fame which never dies.	shakespearean
Take him hence.	shakespearean
Hymen brought her from heaven Yes, brought her here.	modern
Yes, marry, sir.	shakespearean
For the most part, too, they are foolish that are so.	shakespearean
Don’t ask why.	modern
A man who’s robbed, but doesn’t miss what’s stolen, isn’t robbed at all.	modern
If you’re Trinculo, then come out.	modern
I do beseech you, take it not amiss; I cannot, nor I will not, yield to you.	shakespearean
Well, go to.	shakespearean
Hath an argosy cast away coming from Tripolis.	shakespearean
Yes, as kind as snow to a harvest.	modern
Has it come to this?	modern
You need to learn what ants know well about winter—there’s no point in slaving away if there’s no hope for profit.	modern
He exposed Edgar’s murderous plot, and was wounded, as you see there, when trying to apprehend him.	modern
Though it be pity to see such a sight, it well becomes the ground.	shakespearean
She’s busy and cannot come!” Is that an answer?	modern
I have done ill, Of which I do accuse myself so sorely That I will joy no more.	shakespearean
I know ’t—my sister’s.	shakespearean
I tell thee, Litio, this is wonderful!	shakespearean
I’ll call for you soon.	modern
I lent my body once to make him rich.	modern
Ay, boy.	shakespearean
Brother— Quiet.	modern
Another general shout!	shakespearean
There go the minstrels.	modern
That’s why paintings of Cupid, the god of love, always show him as blind.	modern
And why, sir, must they so?	shakespearean
It has been done already, and the messenger is on his way.	modern
Good morrow to you both.	shakespearean
Give me a hand and help me off with this magic cloak.	modern
Thus says my king: an if your father’s Highness Do not, in grant of all demands at large, Sweeten the bitter mock you sent his Majesty, He’ll call you to so hot an answer of it That caves and womby vaultages of France Shall chide your trespass and return your mock In second accent of his ordinance.	shakespearean
You take pleasure then in the message?	shakespearean
O wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame?	shakespearean
With the quick, intelligent wit she’s rumored to have, she can’t really be such a bad judge of character that she’d refuse a man as exceptional as Signior Benedick.	modern
Death, traitor!	shakespearean
I pray you, dissuade him from her.	shakespearean
The sun is up and we’re wasting the day!	modern
As he was valiant, I honor him.	shakespearean
I took their stings too, wouldn’t you say?	modern
Wake Duncan with thy knocking.	shakespearean
Didn’t you call him a liar?	modern
What is thy name?	shakespearean
Good, good, I like that—it’s only fair!	modern
I’m glad.	modern
You peers, continue this united league.	shakespearean
By God’s sonties, ’twill be a hard way to hit.	shakespearean
She says enough, yet she’s a simple bawd That cannot say as much.	shakespearean
Take him to my sleeping area.	modern
Just let me follow behind you, even though I’m not good enough for you.	modern
I’m indebted to you.	modern
That’s what made him crazy.	modern
Where should we go?	modern
News, madam.	shakespearean
I will live in thy heart, die in thy lap, and be buried in thy eyes—and moreover, I will go with thee to thy uncle’s.	shakespearean
A leathermaker will last nine years.	modern
Hound or spaniel, brach or him,  Bobtail tyke or trundle-tail—  Tom will make them weep and wail.	shakespearean
I have to ask you, as a favor, not to let on that you recognize me until the time is right.	modern
I have to eat my dinner now.	modern
I have told thee often, and I re-tell thee again and again, I hate the Moor.	shakespearean
Every man look o'er his part.	shakespearean
Oh, honey!	modern
But whenever you feel a larger pain, the smaller one disappears.	modern
Come, sister.—Shepherdess, look on him better, And be not proud.	shakespearean
Be patient, gentlemen.	shakespearean
What will be my evidence?	modern
You’re not answering my question.	modern
That sir which serves and seeks for gain,  And follows but for form,  Will pack when it begins to rain  And leave thee in the storm.	shakespearean
These outbursts of yours don’t even look like real fear.	modern
How now, my dear Othello?	shakespearean
Whom should I knock?	shakespearean
And leave us, Publius, lest that the people, Rushing on us, should do your age some mischief.	shakespearean
The pound of flesh that I want from him was very expensive.	modern
The merchandise you bring from Rome is too expensive for me.	modern
Good luck.	modern
Be Kent unmannerly When Lear is mad.	shakespearean
I don’t really understand what you mean.	modern

I have money in my purse and property at home, so I’m off to see the world.	modern
But this place is too cold for hell.	shakespearean
I’m not Lear.	modern
Be warned by me, then: they that ride so, and ride not warily, fall into foul bogs.	shakespearean
Why then, thou hast it.	shakespearean
Great Duke, be merciful to mortal men.	modern
Oh, that’s nonsense!	modern
He ate at my house, but that doesn’t make me nervous.	modern
It pleases your Worship to say so, but we are the poor duke’s officers.	shakespearean

If you choose that one, I’m yours, along with the picture.	modern
So smooth he daubed his vice with show of virtue That, his apparent open guilt omitted— I mean his conversation with Shore’s wife— He lived from all attainder of suspects.	shakespearean
He’ll bring a lot of money to the person who owns him, that’s for sure.	modern

To whom, my lord?	shakespearean
Why, friends, you don’t even know what you’re doing yet.	modern

I know you can do better than that, but it’ll do for now.	modern
How did we manage to get ashore?	modern

Grant their law-abiding request!	modern
The whole butt, man.	shakespearean
I think this applause is for some new honors awarded to Caesar.	modern
Go in, and weep not.	shakespearean
Yes, that’s quite likely.	modern
My dearest sister!	modern
She’s yours.—Come, Ariel!	modern
Come on, Desdemona, I’ve only got an hour of love to spend with you, to tell you what you need to do.	modern

But for whose sake did I do that sick deed?	modern
A ripe age.	shakespearean
Now go ahead and tell me the rest of your story.—Please go stand farther away.	modern

But you’re not down and out, either, are you?	modern
Is this my prize?	modern

Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?	shakespearean
Let me alone.	shakespearean
Why, he’s the Prince’s fool, and a very dull fool at that.	modern
Go with me.	shakespearean
Yes, he’s the one who first told me about her.	modern
Get ready for the third hit, Laertes.	modern

Let’s be sacrificers but not butchers, Caius.	modern
Advise your fellows so.	shakespearean
Now I’ll get Cassio to do something in front of all these drunkards that will offend everyone on the island.	modern
Who serv’st thou under?	shakespearean
Yes, I want it, and I’ll get it.	modern
Here, take away this dish.	shakespearean
In time we hate that which we often fear.	shakespearean
He’s as brave as a fox.	modern
Why should the poor be flattered?	shakespearean
You best know the place.	shakespearean
He is the only man of Italy, Always excepted my dear Claudio.	shakespearean
Back then, I called you “a poor, imitation queen,” a badly reproduced copy of what I was, a pretty prologue for the tragedy that was about to follow, a woman who was lifted high only to be hurled down to hell, a mother only teased with two beautiful children, who would soon die.	modern

And when you do them—     Cassius, be content.	shakespearean
To cry “Amen” to that, thus we appear.	shakespearean
But I would rather abstain from everything for four days than drink so much in one.	modern
As I intend to prosper and repent, So thrive I in my dangerous affairs Of hostile arms!	shakespearean
There remain And fortify it strongly 'gainst the French.	shakespearean
She was filthy!	modern
My Lord of Oxford, you, Sir William Brandon, and you, Sir Walter Herbert, are going to stay with me.	modern
He’ll tell them so.	modern
Have a safe trip.	modern
Good sooth, even thus.	shakespearean
Not long ago you challenged and opposed your brother, and it is only very recently that he has forgiven you.	modern
In a false quarrel there is no true valor.	shakespearean

Prithee, how many boys and wenches must I have?	shakespearean
Is the snake better than the eel because the pattern on his back pleases the eye?	modern
Have Montjoy hurry, then, Lord Constable, and have him ask the king of England what he is willing to pay us to get out of the war.	modern

I am sorry for my cousin.	shakespearean
That’s right, you stupid thing.	modern
You’ve never thought of me like that, and you have no reason to.	modern
I grant him bloody, Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful, Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin That has a name.	shakespearean

Take care of the queen!	modern
Tell me.	modern
Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.	shakespearean

And let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them, for there be of them that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too, though in the meantime some necessary question of the play be then to be considered.	shakespearean

Please let me know your plan, Bassanio.	modern
But my personal motivation—and that which should move you most to sanction my departure—is that Fulvia is dead.	modern

It looks that way.	modern
If not, to say to thee that I shall die is true, but for thy love, by the Lord, no.	shakespearean
But I’ll marry you under different circumstances—with extravagant festivals, public festivities, and celebration.	modern
Full many a lady I have eyed with best regard and many a time	shakespearean
They are afoot.	shakespearean
Why should I now have to make do with only twenty-five?	modern
All men’s faces are true, whatsome’er their hands are.	shakespearean
What says the golden chest?	shakespearean
The rest of the king’s guests are already inside.	modern
Why, sir, must he?	modern
Well, the poor man died by your first order, which was carried by a winged messenger.	modern
It’s too bad that Antony’s fault should make you look like a jerk.	modern
Go thou.	shakespearean
Speak, Claudio, that’s your cue.	modern
Where’s Dolabella, To second Proculeius?	shakespearean
No, truly, but in friendly recompense.	shakespearean
I demand to be satisfied.	modern
A lioness gave birth in the streets, and graves cracked open and thrust out their dead.	modern
I can be discreet in honorable matters, ride a horse, run, tell a good story badly, and deliver a plain message bluntly.	modern
I am to blame to be thus waited for.	shakespearean
Let’s briefly put on manly readiness, And meet i' th' hall together.	shakespearean
Why are you talking about robbery?	modern
To the Forest of Arden, to find your father.	modern
Lieutenant Cassio will be on guard duty tonight.	modern
Come, gentlemen, let’s discuss tomorrow’s action in my tent.	modern
I have to tell you everything.	modern
Shall I say to Caesar What you require of him?	shakespearean
Spoke like an officer!	shakespearean
All you English princes, I salute you.	modern
I will verify as much in his beard.	shakespearean
But the rarity of it is—which is indeed almost beyond credit—  As many vouched rarities are.	shakespearean
Fellow, I know thee.	shakespearean
Pull them apart.	modern
O thou weed, Who art so lovely fair and smell’st so sweet That the sense aches at thee, would thou hadst ne'er been born!	shakespearean
What if I am?	modern
I’ve shut the memory of your beautiful eyes out of my heart.	modern
You’ll be lord of the island then, and I’ll be your servant.	modern
I would kiss before I spoke.	shakespearean
Besides, he’s young and handsome, and he’s got all the qualities that naïve and silly girls go for.	modern
You did know How much you were my conqueror, and that My sword, made weak by my affection, would Obey it on all cause.	shakespearean
Since nobody knows anything about what he leaves behind, then what does it mean to leave early?	modern
I didn’t take any more pains bringing this message than you took pains in thanking me.	modern
We, now at our largest, can only decrease.	modern
We are all made of dreams, and our life stretches from sleep before birth to sleep after death.	modern
Some of them are leaning already.	modern
I would fain prove so.	shakespearean
Why, now, blow wind, swell billow, and swim bark!	shakespearean
Go to.	shakespearean
I will be hanged, if some eternal villain, Some busy and insinuating rogue, Some cogging, cozening slave, to get some office, Have not devised this slander.	shakespearean
Till which encounter It is my business too.	shakespearean
Oh, banish me, my lord, but kill me not!	shakespearean
No, my good lord.	shakespearean

I’ve got a plan that will fix everything.	modern
You’ll wear a mask, and you can make your voice as high as you want to.	modern
Now let me tell you, Casca, I have already convinced some of the noblest Romans to join me in an honorable but dangerous mission.	modern
Could my good brother-in-law—a man to whom the	modern
Thus do all traitors.	shakespearean
He would not?	shakespearean
When we’re by ourselves you can call me “Tranio.” Everywhere else, address me as your master Lucentio.	modern
Why did you send me out, brave Cassius?	modern
I’ll do most of the drinking for you.	modern
Those that Macbeth hath slain.	shakespearean
Answer me.	modern
You are completely wrong about this king.	modern
Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?	shakespearean
His grace hath made the match, and all grace say “Amen” to it.	shakespearean
Advise yourself.	shakespearean
For me, three thousand ducats.	shakespearean
All this done Upon the gad?—Edmund, how now?	shakespearean
If I can recover him and keep him tame and get to Naples with him, he’s a present for any emperor that ever trod on neat’s leather.	shakespearean
What noise is that?	shakespearean
He refuses to admit what everyone else knows.	modern
I’ll tell him the news.	modern
If not, then this parting was well done.	modern
Draw your sword and give me enough blows to kill me.	modern
And this report Hath so exasperated the king that he Prepares for some attempt of war.	shakespearean
Be sad only at the fact that you’ll lose your friend—your friend doesn’t regret that he paid your debt.	modern

Where’s thy conscience now?	shakespearean
Ay, madam, it is common.	shakespearean
The oars were silver, Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made The water which they beat to follow faster, As amorous of their strokes.	shakespearean
Tell me what I want to know.	modern
Tomorrow, Caesar, I’ll be able to tell you what land and sea forces I can raise for this war.	modern
A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.	shakespearean
Come, come, we’re worrying about the worst-case scenario.	modern
What are these things we’re looking at, my lord Antonio?	modern
Thus it must be.	shakespearean
Kent, on thy life, no more.	shakespearean
The source from which your royal blood comes has been stopped.	modern
How say you, sir?	shakespearean
Yet is this no charm for the toothache.—Old Signior, walk aside with me.	shakespearean
We see yonder the beginning of the day, but I think we shall never see the end of it.—Who goes there?	shakespearean
I’ll tell my husband, Launcelot, what you say.	shakespearean
Dead, I think.—Help, uncle!— Hero, why, Hero!	shakespearean
And you’re all sizzle.	modern
Even though it’s early, there are already a thousand armored soldiers waiting for you at the harbor.	modern
And so of men.	shakespearean
Not by the likes of you!	modern
I wasn’t born to die on your sword.	modern
Amen to that.	modern
I swear to God I’ll get revenge.	modern
If we grow all to be pork-eaters, we shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money.	shakespearean
A proper saying!	shakespearean
My mask is like the roof of the poor	modern
My reputation, Iago, my reputation!	shakespearean
Firm and irrevocable is my doom Which I have passed upon her.	shakespearean
The people love me, and the sea is mine.	shakespearean
Once more, what news?	shakespearean
In this time of the night?	shakespearean
He’s not jealous?	modern
Now, by my mother’s son, and that’s myself, It shall be moon, or star, or what I list, Or e'er I journey to your father’s house.	shakespearean
Tell me that.	shakespearean
You must be the one who laughs when boys or women tell you their dreams.	modern
It’s him, it’s him.	modern
You told me she got them, and that she promised to give me a little something in return soon, but nothing like that ever happens.	modern
I don’t wish that on you.	modern
I swear I’ll smack you if you hit me again.	modern
Pray you come in.	shakespearean
O villain, villain, smiling, damnèd villain!	shakespearean
A brave vessel Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her Dashed all to pieces.	shakespearean
Will you surrender and avoid all this or be called to account for the destruction of this town?	modern
Do as I bid thee.	shakespearean
I’m even happier that I’m not stupid, and I can learn.	modern
Well, that doesn’t worry me.	modern
My master’s calling me.	modern
Oh, on my soul, my cousin is belied!	shakespearean
Who bids thee call?	shakespearean
I will so.	shakespearean
You’re so much older than you look!	modern
Oh, how he loves Caesar!	shakespearean
I knew him when he would’ve walked ten miles to see a well-crafted suit of armor; now he spends ten nights awake in his room designing himself a fancy new jacket.	modern
That’s all I wanted to know.	modern
I will withdraw To furnish me with some swift means of death For the fair devil.	shakespearean

I was always plain with you, and so now I speak my agitation of the matter.	shakespearean
What, not even to pray?	modern
Then never man was man true.	shakespearean
Within a month, Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears Had left the flushing in her gallèd eyes, She married.	shakespearean
I admit the cape.	modern
Tis strange that they should so depart from home, And not send back my messenger.	shakespearean
I told him to come back and talk to me in a bit, and he promised he would.	modern
This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child And here was left by th' sailors.	shakespearean
It’s a deal!	modern
What’s that noise?	modern
I’ll slit the villain’s nose that would have sent me to the jail.	shakespearean
Then tell me, what makes he upon the seas?	shakespearean
My lord, I did intend it.	shakespearean
Art thou there, Diomed?	shakespearean
You’re sick, yet you sneak out of your warm bed and let the humid and disease-infested air make you sicker?	modern

This, this All Souls' Day to my fearful soul Is the determined respite of my wrongs.	shakespearean
Oh, couldst thou speak, That I might hear thee call great Caesar ass Unpolicied!	shakespearean
Have you ever cured anyone this way before?	modern
The only possibility is that you’ve murdered him.	modern
Yes, leeks are good.	modern
We have to take the king’s side.	modern
At once, good night.	shakespearean
You are welcome here.	modern
At other times, I know what’s what.	modern
Do not torment me.	shakespearean
Why, what’s a moveable?	shakespearean
Your eldest daughters destroyed themselves and died in despair.	modern
Oh, dear husband, don’t believe everything you hear—or if you must believe it, don’t let it all make you angry.	modern
I will fetch him.	shakespearean
By the end I will either live, or else I’ll restore my honor by shedding my blood.	modern
The spirits that know All mortal consequences have pronounced me thus: “Fear not, Macbeth.	shakespearean
Oh, Regan, she’s torn me apart with unkindness, like a vulture, right here.	modern
There’s a nicer piece of work right here.	modern
Dearest, kindest, most honorable sir, may I say, with your esteemed approval, which is lit up by the illuminating radiance of the sun-god Phoebus, that— What do you mean by that?	modern
But fish not with this melancholy bait For this fool gudgeon, this opinion.— Come, good Lorenzo.—Fare ye well awhile.	shakespearean
I am never merry when I hear sweet music.	shakespearean
Ay, sir, for three months.	shakespearean
He’s gone, but his wife’s killed.	shakespearean
Hear you aught of her in yours?	shakespearean
My father’s loss, the weakness which I feel, The wrack of all my friends, nor this man’s threats, To whom I am subdued, are but light to me, Might I but through my prison once a day Behold this maid.	shakespearean
I hate him so much it makes me sick, and whoever can ruin his happiness will make me happy.	modern
Yet you, the murderer, look as bright, as clear, As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere.	shakespearean
Madam, here comes your husband.	modern
Look at the stars, see how the floor of heaven is inlaid with small disks of bright gold.	modern
Go around the forest, moving faster than the wind, and make sure you find Helena of Athens.—She’s lovesick, and her face is pale from all the sighing she’s been doing, because sighing is bad for the blood.	modern
I heard that Apollodorus carried—   What did he carry, please?	modern
Thither will I invite the duke and all’s contented followers.	shakespearean
I loved this man so much it makes me weep.	modern
Nothing, but this is so.	shakespearean
My father, led by a poor peasant?	modern
What could I say, my dear?	modern
I give you a sister whom I love more than a brother ever loved any sister.	modern
Casca, by your voice.	shakespearean
Everyone’s there except Metellus Cimber, and he’s gone to look for you at your house.	modern
Fie, fie on all tired jades, on all mad masters, and all foul ways!	shakespearean
But thinking like this won’t help me choose a husband.	modern
Give us answers.	modern
We have beat him to his camp.	shakespearean
I’m the one who fathered those bloodsucking daughters.	modern
I will, even if I were king of all kingdoms.	modern
Tis just.	shakespearean
That will please God, who has him now.	modern
Thou look’st like him that knows a warlike charge.	shakespearean
Thou art thy father’s daughter.	shakespearean
No, I must let them find me.	modern
Well, my dread lord—so must I call you now.	shakespearean
Now all the blessings Of a glad father, compass thee about.	shakespearean
I cannot draw a cart, nor eat dried oats.	shakespearean
This broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter, and, my fortunes against any lay worth naming, this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before.	shakespearean
I, madam?	shakespearean
I know not.	shakespearean
It was just that the showiness of his grief sent me into a fury.	modern
Do not say so, Lysander.	shakespearean
How think you of it?	shakespearean
Which of you—if you were a prince’s son Being pent from liberty, as I am now— If two such murderers as yourselves came to you, Would not entreat for life?	shakespearean
Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind, says, “Suum, mun, nonny.” Dauphin my boy, my boy, cessez.	shakespearean
Tis monstrous.	shakespearean
Hence with your little ones.	shakespearean
No, faith, die by attorney.	shakespearean
Yes, Captain, but with this acknowledgement—that God fought for us.	modern
Shall we go, coz?	shakespearean
Why did you bring these daggers from the place?	shakespearean
Oh, that a lady of one man refused Should of another therefore be abused!	shakespearean
Confined together In the same fashion as you gave in charge, Just as you left them, all prisoners, sir, In the line grove which weather-fends your cell.	shakespearean
What’s going on in here?	modern
The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices Make instruments to plague us.	shakespearean
Signor Bassanio, hear me.	shakespearean
A good moral, my lord: it is not enough to speak, but to speak true.	shakespearean
No, he just gets reality completely wrong.	modern
What Tranio did, he did at my command.	modern
Be lion-mettled, proud, and take no care Who chafes, who frets, or where conspirers are.	shakespearean
Oh, the glory of war has faded.	modern
I’ll fight till from my bones my flesh be hacked.	shakespearean
It’s your music, madam, from your house.	modern
Right now we’re shaken up by fears and doubts.	modern
And yet my sky shall not want.	shakespearean
Nay, an I tell you that, I’ll ne'er look you i' th' face again.	shakespearean
It’s worthless.	modern
Set him before me.	shakespearean
The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives, With blearèd visages come forth to view The issue of th' exploit.—Go, Hercules!	shakespearean
That is he.	shakespearean
So you’ve dared him to single combat.	modern
This is not yet an Alexandrian feast.	shakespearean
Did he take interest?	shakespearean
Two o'clock is your hour?	shakespearean
Oh, coward that I am, to live so long To see my best friend ta'en before my face!	shakespearean
Touch her soft mouth, and march.	shakespearean
Thy asses are gone about 'em.	shakespearean
Let our best heads Know that tomorrow the last of many battles We mean to fight.	shakespearean
I see Regan and Goneril in hell—A thousand hissing devils with sizzling red pitchforks come up to them!	modern
Bid me tear the bond.	shakespearean
How malicious is my fortune, that I must repent to be just!	shakespearean
He’s out of his right mind.	modern
How goes it, friend Eros?	modern
I by bargain should Wear it myself.	shakespearean
No, just help me unpin this.	modern
I’ll tell everyone what you did, even if it	modern
If you have poison for me, I will drink it.	shakespearean
What’s he?	shakespearean
My breath and blood!	shakespearean
I have marked A thousand blushing apparitions To start into her face, a thousand innocent shames In angel whiteness beat away those blushes, And in her eye there hath appeared a fire To burn the errors that these princes hold Against her maiden truth.	shakespearean
If she is silent and won’t speak at all, I’ll praise her chattiness and say she speaks with piercing eloquence.	modern
All the worse that she stooped this low, then.	modern
Ay, and Wall too.	shakespearean
Now, most noble Brutus, The gods today stand friendly that we may, Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age.	shakespearean
Imagine, me, a drunk!	modern
And what will you do if it returns to you?	modern
Before I hear him, I want to decide some important issues that are on my mind concerning my throne and France.	modern
Maybe it’s an English tailor who liked to skimp on the fabric for people’s clothes.	modern
Pray thee, marry us.	shakespearean
Finally, the ceremony done, he called for wine.	modern
Tell him that when our noble father, the duke of York, gave his three sons his blessing, he never imagined that our friendship would come to this.	modern
Listen to him talk about war, and you’ll hear elegant and thrilling accounts of the battles.	modern
Crown him that, And then I grant we put a sting in him That at his will he may do danger with.	shakespearean
This not to do, So grace and mercy at your most need help you, Swear.	shakespearean
No man’s life was to be trusted with them.	shakespearean
In the first act he is an infant, whimpering and puking in his nurse’s arms.	modern
I know you from before.	modern
Lysander, keep your Hermia.	modern
If you will not, come when you are next prepared for.	shakespearean
Lead us, monster; we’ll follow.	modern
Will you please make this half-devil say why he tricked me and damned my soul?	modern
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy— Which, like dumb mouths, do ope their ruby lips To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue— A curse shall light upon the limbs of men.	shakespearean
And so in me, and so, I think, in all.	shakespearean
May God give their souls rest.	modern
His coffers are too poor to atone for our losses, his entire kingdom too small to account for the amount of blood we’ve shed, and the sight of him kneeling at our feet an empty satisfaction compared to the indignity we have put up with.	modern
Pray ye, sir?	shakespearean
He’s furious because she stole an adorable boy from an Indian king.	modern
Whiles I threat, he lives.	shakespearean
Even he.	shakespearean
I hope we have the time some day!	modern
Sneaky, dried-up old coot!	modern
And mine a hundred and forty.	shakespearean
And in return for this gift, he wishes you to drop your claim to the dukedoms.	modern
And so I shall catch the fly, your cousin, in the latter end and she must be blind too.	shakespearean
What would you like?	modern
Not with any sauce they could provide for them.	modern
Damn those words, “but yet!” “But yet” is like a jailer about to bring out some horrible criminal.	modern
Follow them, please.	modern
Invest me in my motley.	shakespearean
Yet not one among them, if all three were to wait on me, could be my “man,” because three such fakes don’t amount to a man.	modern
They are full of pity for Caesar.	modern
Nay, faith, I’ll see the church a' your back, and then come back to my master’s as soon as I can.	shakespearean
Coldhearted toward me?	shakespearean
Please stay seated.	modern
Here, noble lord.	shakespearean
How did my master die, Strato?	modern
Yes, ma'am.	modern
Oh, that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!	shakespearean
What’s your answer?	modern
Now I have to leave.	modern
Give me thy arm.	shakespearean
Master Fer!	modern
I am now in great haste, as it may appear unto you.	shakespearean
I won’t listen to you.	modern
When beggars die there are no comets in the sky.	modern
Oh, and then at the very next turn, don’t turn left or right, but turn down and around to the Jew’s house.	modern
Therefore great France My mourning and importuned tears hath pitied.	shakespearean
He’s got my vote as I die.	modern
O mercy, God!	shakespearean
What ish my nation?	shakespearean
It was a huge mistake to let old Gloucester live after we blinded him.	modern
Bring them to me.	modern
Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex.	shakespearean
I think they want him to go home and appoint Cassio governor in his place.	modern
Snakes shed their skin there, and the shed skin is wide enough to wrap a fairy in.	modern
Oh, no.	modern
Yes, and that’s surprising, because lovers are usually early.	modern
It looks like a day when the sun is hidden.	modern
The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could carry cannon by our sides.	shakespearean
And so he fell.	shakespearean
He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain From the excess of laughter.	shakespearean
Add details of your own to back up what I’m saying.	modern
Light the candles!	modern
Therefore should every soldier in the wars do as every sick man in his bed: wash every mote out of his conscience.	shakespearean
You say you’re a better soldier.	modern
What, is the man lunatic?	shakespearean
Look, he’s recovering.	modern
Alas, poor hurt fowl, now will he creep into sedges.	shakespearean
With all of them at once: they work together to create such an entirely evil person that no good ever manages to enter the mix.	modern
Get out of my face.	modern
But how?	modern
But where the greater malady is fixed The lesser is scarce felt.	shakespearean
Why, go to then.	shakespearean
Look, here comes the woman you love.	modern
It is that.	modern
Three proper young men, all good looking and with great presence—	modern
But did I never speak of all that time?	shakespearean
And, being men, the contents of Caesar’s will would enrage you.	modern
But for your private satisfaction, because I love you, I’ll tell you.	modern
Most heartily I do beseech the court To give the judgment.	shakespearean
It will be made even heavier soon—by the weight of a man.	modern
There aren’t three people in all of Egypt who could do better.	modern
My lord, I did, But answer made it none.	shakespearean
Let’s go!	modern
Take me by the hand and say, “Harry of England, I am yours.” No sooner shall I hear that word than I will tell you straight out, “England is yours, Ireland is yours, France is yours, and Harry Plantagenet	modern
Monster, I will kill this man.	shakespearean
Over hill, over dale,  Thorough bush, thorough brier,  Over park, over pale,  Thorough flood, thorough fire.	shakespearean
I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing.	shakespearean
I didn’t say anything.	modern
The work we enjoy is not really work.	modern
It’s impossible.	modern
Can you feel your legs?	modern
I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.	shakespearean
Fortune is an excellent moral.	shakespearean
Who is so low that he wouldn’t?	modern
Please go to him, my friend.	modern
But come, your Bergomask.	shakespearean
It’s true, good lieutenant.	shakespearean
Marry, sir, to get a husband for her sister.	shakespearean
It blushes, is easily embarrassed, and stages regular uprisings in a man’s heart.	modern
My master is grown quarrelsome.	shakespearean
Fie upon ’t, foh!	shakespearean
Nothing at all.	shakespearean
What do you here?	shakespearean
Stood the state so?	shakespearean
In the meantime I will draw a bill of properties such as our play wants.	shakespearean
Fine, i' faith!	shakespearean
So were their daggers, which unwiped we found Upon their pillows.	shakespearean
In England this strange monster would be just like a man.	modern
Upon my life, my lord, I’ll do it.	modern
Pray you, let’s have no more fooling about it, but give me your blessing.	shakespearean
Zounds, he dies!	shakespearean
Take that, and that.	modern
How clever of you.	modern
Oh, young and noble Cato, have you been slain?	modern
It weeps, it bleeds, and each new day a gash Is added to her wounds.	shakespearean
The article of my oath?	shakespearean
O infinite virtue, com’st thou smiling from The world’s great snare uncaught?	shakespearean
He that sweetest rose will find Must find love’s prick, and Rosalind.	shakespearean
This will either make us or break us.	modern
Who can say I mean just her when all her neighbors are exactly like her?	modern
Let me speak proudly: tell the constable We are but warriors for the working day; Our gayness and our gilt are all besmirched With rainy marching in the painful field.	shakespearean
So be careful.	modern
My lord, I have news for you.	modern
There lies your way.	shakespearean
What an idiot I was to think this drunkard was a god and to worship such a stupid fool!	modern
Here, you there, Grumio.	modern
The glove which I have given him for a favor May haply purchase him a box o' th' ear.	shakespearean
I will do this deed before I lose my sense of purpose.	modern
Only I yield to die.	shakespearean
They shall have none, I swear, but these my joints, Which, if they have, as I will leave 'em them, Shall yield them little.	shakespearean
The highest-ranking?	modern
Would you mind if we woke up the king?	modern
I want the law, the penalty, and the fulfillment of my contract.	modern
It’s a strange snake.	modern
I’ll talk with this good man.	modern
Why not!	modern
Now from head to foot I’m as firm as marble.	modern
Say again, where didst thou leave these varlets?	shakespearean
Lady Beatrice, have you wept all this while?	shakespearean
People don’t cry when they’re mocking someone.	modern
Where are you going?	modern
Ring the alarm bell.	modern
Do you agree that Ferdinand must have drowned?	modern
If you shut the windows, it will pour out the keyhole.	modern
The basest horn of his hoof is more musical than the pipe of Hermes.	shakespearean
Help, ho, help!	shakespearean
Of all places, I don’t like the	modern
Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.	shakespearean
Give mine the benefit of seigniory, And let my griefs frown on the upper hand.	shakespearean
Why did you carry these daggers out of the room?	modern
What’s the prize?	modern
Lead him to my bower.	shakespearean
Hath he asked for me?	shakespearean
Ere I would say I would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen, I would change my humanity with a baboon.	shakespearean
Very well, thank you.	modern
And how was that ta'en up?	shakespearean
I pray you, let it stand.	shakespearean
What does that have to do with my Lysander?	modern
I was born to speak all mirth and no  matter.	shakespearean
How fares my gracious sir?	shakespearean
Is that possible?	modern
Did he marry me just to starve me?	modern
You durst not so have tempted him.	shakespearean
I am a gentleman, sir, and my name is Conrade.	shakespearean
He’s an important person.	modern
If I’m telling the truth like a fool in saying all this, whip the first person who thinks I sound foolish.	modern
We’re overjoyed to see you sane again.	modern
His most horrible murder.	modern
I admit it doesn’t look that way to me, and the fact that you suspect me shows that you’re smart.	modern
I must needs tell thee all.	shakespearean
Good madam, keep yourself within yourself.	shakespearean
Your wife, Fulvia, is dead.	modern
By my faith, he is very swift and sententious.	shakespearean
Three miles from here you can see it coming, a moving forest.	modern
Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature, if it be well used.	shakespearean
My dear friends, thanks for your patience.	modern
My library was a large enough dukedom for me.	modern
Hast thou, spirit, Performed to point the tempest that I bade thee?	shakespearean
The day is well on its way.	modern
That shows thou art unconfirmed.	shakespearean
You, you, ay, you!	shakespearean
Toward Chertsey, noble lord?	modern
Better once than never, for never too late.	shakespearean
Nobody’s coming?	modern
They say there are only five people on it.	modern
Then I’d be punished for the sins of my mother.	modern
With the handicap they’ve given me, I think I’ll win.	modern
Why then, your uncle and the Prince and Claudio Have been deceived.	shakespearean
Go, make money.	shakespearean
While the moon was shining we didn’t even notice the candle.	modern
We will spare for no wit, I warrant you.	shakespearean
I am your neighbor, and was suitor first.	shakespearean
God and your arms be praised, victorious friends!	shakespearean
What shall I say?	shakespearean
My body waits here, but the rest of me is gone.	modern
So, she’s in on this too!	modern
Excuse me, sir.— Tom’s chilly.	modern
Do you hear, Cassio?	shakespearean
I would have my bond.	shakespearean
But if I were Brutus and Brutus were me, then I’d stir you up, and install in each of Caesar’s wounds the kind of voice that could convince even stones to rise up and mutiny.	modern
By providence divine.	shakespearean
When I strike, I’ll cry, “All or nothing!” Well put.	modern
Oh, let me remember what happened to Hastings and hurry to	modern
By mine honor I will, and when I break that oath, let me turn monster.	shakespearean
I’m no villain.	modern
But if the cause be not good, the king himself hath a heavy reckoning to make, when all those legs and arms and heads, chopped off in a battle, shall join together at the latter day, and cry all, “We died at such a place,” some swearing, some crying for a surgeon, some upon their wives left poor behind them, some upon the debts they owe, some upon their children rawly left.	shakespearean
I am sick in displeasure to him, and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges evenly with mine.	shakespearean
Pay me three times the amount of the loan and let the Christian go.	modern
Come, why be so hesitant?	modern
Yes, sir, it’s all too true, God help us.	modern
I’m glad to see you.	modern
Where art thou, Pindarus?	shakespearean
Find out where the Jew’s house is.	modern
What work is here, Charmian?	shakespearean
Greet the king with a welcoming expression in your eyes, your hands, and your words.	modern
Oh, damn her, damn her!	shakespearean
Thus when I shun Scylla your father, I fall into Charybdis your mother.	shakespearean
O wonderful son that can so ’stonish a mother!	shakespearean
Ay, sir, I have a pretty wit.	shakespearean
Tis no such matter.	shakespearean
His military ability is double that of the other two.	modern
Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads To knot and gender in!	shakespearean
Please pardon our brother Clarence.	modern
It is shaped, sir, like itself, and it is as broad as it hath breadth.	shakespearean
You’re alive.	modern
He thinks that since his fortune is twenty times better than yours, it would be like pitting twenty men against one.	modern
No, it’s certain, Iras.	modern
Marcus Octavius, Marcus Justeius, Publicola, and Caelius will go by sea, but we’ll keep the bulk on land.	modern
He’s been in an unusually good mood and has granted many gifts to your household and servants.	modern
All three of us will marry now in death.	modern
Although I hate her, I’ll not harm her so.	shakespearean
He hath every month a new sworn brother.	shakespearean
My Lord of Warwick and my brother Gloucester, Follow Fluellen closely at the heels.	shakespearean
My lord, I don’t think I cried out.	modern
Leave Hermia alone.	modern
Where should we stable our horses?	modern
Who are you?	modern
What’s he That was not born of woman?	shakespearean
Let’s follow the old earl, and get that crazy Tom to take him wherever he wants to go.	modern
The services I have done for the Venetian government will count for more than his complaints will.	modern
But you didn’t, even though you had every reason.	modern
This grief is crowned with consolation.	shakespearean
So, by heaven’s decree, Rosalind Was composed Of different faces, eyes, and hearts, so that she might have the most prized touches of all.	modern
Tomorrow I’ll be at the depths of my misery thinking about the happiness my brother has achieved, in having what he wished for.	modern
Alack, sir, you cannot see your way.	shakespearean
Good dawning to thee, friend.	shakespearean
mutinies, in countries discord, in palaces treason, and the bond cracked ’twixt son and father.	shakespearean
Yes, my lord.	modern
Let’s follow the music as far as we can without leaving our station and see if it stops.	modern
What other bond Than secret Romans that have spoke the word And will not palter?	shakespearean
If I may say so, your Majesty, your famous grandfather and your great-uncle Edward, the Black Prince of Wales—or so I’ve read in the history books—fought a very brave battle here in France.	modern
To our shores Throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends, Unarmed and unresolved to beat them back.	shakespearean
My dear lord, You know the fiery quality of the duke, How unremoveable and fixed he is In his own course.	shakespearean
Like that.	modern
I’ll do so.	modern
I love my master, and he’ll find me very hard-working.	modern
This is the man, this is Antonio, To whom I am so infinitely bound.	shakespearean
Get out of here, you measly, lying wretch.	modern
That’s “Ninus’s grave,” man.	modern
But when you are with him, your angel is weakened and easily frightened.	modern
Herald, save thou thy labor.	shakespearean
Base Trojan, thou shalt die.	shakespearean
I beg you, remember the good work I’ve done for you, and how I’ve never lied to you, never made mistakes, and never grumbled in my work.	modern
Your Grace does me as great honors as can be desired in the hearts of his subjects.	shakespearean
This is just a trifling matter here, sir.	modern
A nice message.	modern
But who’s coming?	modern
I wish you all the comfort that such a dark night as this can offer, noble father-in-law.	modern
If then they chanced to slack you, We could control them.	shakespearean
Well, the beginning that is dead and buried.	shakespearean
I must embrace thee.	shakespearean
As thick as tale Can post with post, and every one did bear Thy praises in his kingdom’s great defense, And poured them down before him.	shakespearean
What though he love your Hermia?	shakespearean
Upon my life, my lord, I’ll undertake it.	shakespearean
Here, sir, as foolish as I was before.	shakespearean
What wicked magician has conjured up this devil to interrupt this sacred burial rite?	modern
If there’s anything more sorrowful left to add, keep it to yourself.	modern
How many then should cover that stand bare!	shakespearean
Those are the raisèd father and his friends.	shakespearean
Here comes one of them now.	modern
No, my friends, don’t please fate by giving it your sorrow as well.	modern
I shall have glory by this losing day More than Octavius and Mark Antony By this vile conquest shall attain unto.	shakespearean
This house is little.	shakespearean
Father, take pity on him.	modern
She replied It should be better he became her guest, Which she entreated.	shakespearean
You are their heir and sit on their throne, and the blood and courage that glorified them run in your veins.	modern
Oh my God, what a terrible world this is!	modern
I don’t know.	modern
Meanwhile, thank you for your efforts.	modern
O dolt!	shakespearean
You and he are both welcome, sir.	modern
Friends, go your separate ways.	modern
Pray thee, sweet Mistress Margaret, deserve well at my hands by helping me to the speech of Beatrice.	shakespearean
I’m off, my lord.	modern
O, in the duke of Gloucester’s purse.	shakespearean
Honest to God, where’s the sexton?	modern
My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up.	shakespearean
Tarry, good Beatrice.	shakespearean
Sweet soul, let’s in, and there expect their coming.	shakespearean
The air Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself Unto our gentle senses.	shakespearean
Aboard, aboard, for shame!	shakespearean
But by sea he is an absolute master.	shakespearean
Be not disturbed with my infirmity.	shakespearean
And I have much less to comfort me than you do, since I’ve lost my daughter.	modern
Be certain, nothing truer.	shakespearean
Hey, Brabantio!	modern
The ground is brown.	modern
Messala, I have here receivèd letters That young Octavius and Mark Antony Come down upon us with a mighty power, Bending their expedition toward Philippi.	shakespearean
Is it fit, The threefold world divided, he should stand One of the three to share it?	shakespearean
Eat your dinner and pay no attention to him.	modern
Let the dying fire shine a glimmering light throughout the house.	modern
Where be these knaves?	shakespearean
We are bound to the like.	shakespearean
Please it your Grace lead on?	shakespearean
What noise?	shakespearean
None at all.	shakespearean
Come, Nerissa.—	shakespearean
So, what hour of comfort have I ever had in your company?	modern
This was the basket.	modern
A servant told me the night-watchmen saw horrid sights too, but different ones from what we heard and saw.	modern
Is he dead?	modern
But Antonio is certainly undone.	shakespearean
Hark, hark!	shakespearean
Here you may roast your goose.	shakespearean
I’ve heard a lot more.	modern
If I did take the kingdom from your sons, To make amends I’ll give it to your daughter.	shakespearean
But I am shepherd to another man And do not shear the fleeces that I graze.	shakespearean
And still do, I swear by my hands.	modern
Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much To think my poverty is treacherous.	shakespearean
Thou shouldst not have been old till thou hadst been wise.	shakespearean
Here, stand behind this bulk, straight will he come.	shakespearean
When beggars die there are no comets seen.	shakespearean
Go back with her?	modern
I’m here, sir.	modern
I have very poor and unhappy brains for drinking.	shakespearean
Please put that log down and rest a while.	modern
We wait upon your Grace.	shakespearean
Good morrow, sweet Hero.	shakespearean

I cannot live without her.	modern
You’ll be ashamed of this forever!	modern
You will never run mad, niece.	shakespearean
You cannot revel into dukedoms there.	shakespearean
It’s true that my brother’s daughter is Queen of Tunis, and heir of Naples.	modern
Two or three men, my lord, who brought the message that Macduff has fled to England.	modern
Well, that’s a fine answer.	modern
Choose your revenge.	modern
Look for yourself—see the top of the cliff way up there?	modern
Your commission’s ready.	shakespearean
I’ll keep my promise just as if you really were Rosalind.	modern
He must be very near by now.	modern
But I won’t attack a woman, even if she is a demon.	modern
I’m happiest of all that I’m yours now, my lord, my king, and you can guide me as you wish.	modern
Write to me very soon and I’ll let you know what she thinks.	modern
That’s Claudio.	modern
Let’s hear what he has to say.	modern
Oh, quick, before I’m gone.	modern
I’m not talking with you.	modern
You’re much deceived.	shakespearean
Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!	shakespearean
He said my eyes and my hair were black and, now that I think of it, he scorned me.	modern
The king loves you very much.	modern
O noble Caesar!	shakespearean
We have here recovered the most dangerous piece of lechery that ever was known in the commonwealth.	shakespearean
Nerissa teaches me what to believe.	shakespearean
How did she get that candle?	modern
Father, in.	shakespearean
I remember wooing a pea plant in her name, and then taking two pea pods and begging her to wear them “for my sake.” Those of us who are really in love will do the strangest things.	modern
Haven’t you made your other love, Demetrius—who kicked me with his foot not long ago—call me a goddess and a divine, rare, precious, heavenly creature?	modern
Get out of here, my friend.	modern
Worthy prince, I know ’t.	shakespearean
And what’s to come of my despisèd time Is naught but bitterness.	shakespearean
Proceed, proceed.	shakespearean
What do you here alone?	shakespearean
How far into the morning is it, lords?	shakespearean
Oh, she was heavenly true!	shakespearean
Modo he’s called, and Mahu.	shakespearean
Thus, I’ll leave without being kissed.	modern
There I’ll see only myself.	modern
Say welcome to all of our friends for me, sir, for in my heart they are all welcome.	modern
This ’greed upon To part with unhacked edges and bear back Our targes undinted.	shakespearean
Thither he Will come to know his destiny.	shakespearean
Have mind upon your health, tempt me no further.	shakespearean
But where is my love?	modern
By my troth, he’ll yield the crow a pudding one of these days.	shakespearean
Is this the king we offered to ransom?	modern
The whole world is a stage, and all the men and women merely actors.	modern
Well then, now Have you considered of my speeches?	shakespearean
Get me a surgeon!	modern
My lord?	modern
Now, Baptista, let’s turn to your younger daughter.	modern
Thou art in a parlous state, shepherd.	shakespearean
And cries aloud, “Tarry, my cousin Suffolk.	shakespearean
Oh, goodbye to my peace of mind!	modern
Oh, really?	modern
I have a health for you.	shakespearean
To take ’t again perforce— Monster ingratitude!	shakespearean
So kind a father!—Be my horses ready?	shakespearean
And, honest company, I thank you all, That have beheld me give away myself To this most patient, sweet and virtuous wife.	shakespearean
An now tell me, how doth your cousin?	shakespearean
Despair and die!	shakespearean
Tell the hot-headed duke that I… But no, not yet.	modern
Look you here, Here is himself, marred, as you see, with traitors.	shakespearean
Let’s go gather our jewels and money.	modern
Ancient, what makes he here?	shakespearean
What might import my sister’s letter to him?	shakespearean
Yes, Lepidus.	modern
This, Cinna.	shakespearean
What, am I being denied death, as well?	modern
Then your other senses must be getting worse because of the trauma of blindness.	modern
He’ll be like this for a little while.	modern
What do you think, girl!	modern
He comes to kill my heart.	shakespearean
Who are you, moaning in the hut like that?	modern
Come hither, Proculeius.	shakespearean
Marry, God forbid!	shakespearean
You stay on the left.	modern
There’s not a one of them but in his house I keep a servant fee’d.	shakespearean
You’ll see, I promise you.	modern
Is Claudio thine enemy?	shakespearean
I, for my part, knew the tailor that made the wings she flew withal.	shakespearean
It’s no use!	modern
Where is your sister, and Hortensio’s wife?	shakespearean
How may we try it further?	shakespearean
Be eloquent in my behalf to her.	shakespearean
I’ll steal away to England, and I’ll steal some more when I get there.	modern
I’ve been looking all over for you.	modern
Now sit we close about this taper here And call in question our necessities.	shakespearean
Calm down.	modern
What’s wrong, cousin?	modern
Good morning, Brutus.	modern
Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, Creeps in this petty pace from day to day To the last syllable of recorded time, And all our yesterdays have lighted fools The way to dusty death.	shakespearean
Sailors, my lord, they say.	shakespearean
No, he’s a devil—a devil, I tell you!	modern
That “fair” again unsay.	shakespearean
If you can leave your body so easily, then the touch of death is like a lover’s pinch, which hurts but is desired.	modern
If you saw yourself with your eyes or knew yourself with your judgment, the fear of your adventure would counsel you to a more equal enterprise.	shakespearean
Who’s there, in the other devil’s name?	modern
Twenty-five, sir.	modern
All right, stop this.	modern
But it would better fit your honor to change your mind.	shakespearean
I have forgot your name, but sure that part Was aptly fitted and naturally performed.	shakespearean
Instead, hide your true face behind smiles and friendliness.	modern
Give the word, ho, and stand.	shakespearean
What are you going to do for a father?	modern
He will live as a cursed man.	modern
The Moor already changes with my poison.	shakespearean
Not that we love words better, as you do.	shakespearean
If with myself I hold intelligence Or have acquaintance with mine own desires, If that I do not dream or be not frantic— As I do trust I am not—then, dear uncle, Never so much as in a thought unborn Did I offend your Highness.	shakespearean
Do as I say.	modern
Thanks for letting me go.	modern
Let it be so.	shakespearean
And art thou living, Stephano?	shakespearean
Look at them.	modern
We heard that once you were served eight wild boars roasted whole for breakfast—for only twelve people!	modern
Have you snuck over here to watch the wrestling?	modern
Those being all my study, The government I cast upon my brother And to my state grew stranger, being transported And rapt in secret studies.	shakespearean
If we walk not in the trodden paths our very petticoats will catch them.	shakespearean
I think withal There would be hands uplifted in my right; And here from gracious England have I offer Of goodly thousands.	shakespearean
Where is thy power, then, to beat him back?	shakespearean
Bad luck, bad luck?	modern
How now?	shakespearean
Come, sir.	shakespearean
Why, for that too.	shakespearean
Well, I am sorry for your niece.	shakespearean
But it’s dark out, and it could be a trap.	modern
This was a venture, sir, that Jacob served for— A thing not in his power to bring to pass But swayed and fashioned by the hand of heaven.	shakespearean
I’ll go farther off.	shakespearean
That’s impossible.	modern
How  What, are you jealous, Oberon?—Fairies, let’s get out of here.	modern
Before you can say “Come” and “Go,” And breathe twice and cry “So, so!” Each one, tripping on his toe,	shakespearean
This treachery of yours is like the second	modern
Do you really think there’s a man fool enough to marry into hell—however rich the father is?	modern
Alack, alack!	shakespearean
Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.	shakespearean
Oh, noble Caesar!	modern
A man, as you are.	shakespearean
Hurry up, Audrey, hurry.—I’m coming, I’m coming.	modern
He says so.	shakespearean
In him there is a hope of government, Which, in his nonage, council under him, And, in his full and ripened years, himself, No doubt shall then, and till then, govern well.	shakespearean
So long?	shakespearean
I’ll tell you who time ambles withal, who time trots withal, who time gallops withal, and who he stands still withal.	shakespearean
I was with Hercules and Cadmus once, When in a wood of Crete they bayed the bear With hounds of Sparta.	shakespearean
Take heed you fall not.	shakespearean
You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames Into her scornful eyes!	shakespearean
A fair name.	shakespearean
Now let’s sit closely around this candle and discuss our needs.	modern
If it’s sad to see a handsome man with a cheating wife, it’s a tragedy to see an ugly thug with a wife who’s faithful.	modern
And there’s a messenger representing a fifth one, the prince of Morocco, who says the prince will be here tonight.	modern
Madam, sleeps still.	shakespearean
The world’s a liar.	modern
Uncle of Exeter, release the man who was arrested yesterday for railing against me.	modern
Don’t worry about how I handle it.	modern
But major issues must come before minor ones.	modern
Here, sir!” You stupid, unpolished dolts!	modern
Kings and noblemen served him.	modern
Oh, I were damned beneath all depth in hell, But that I did proceed upon just grounds To this extremity.	shakespearean
If you knew my business, You would entreat me rather go than stay.	shakespearean
Can’t help it?	modern
He’s not here.	modern
I wonder what it means.	modern
I wasn’t invited because they like me.	modern
Ay, by my life, And never did desire to see thee more.	shakespearean
Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?	shakespearean
But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter— Or rather a disease that’s in my flesh, Which I must needs call mine.	shakespearean
With God as my witness, I swear I have wept for yours.	modern
Hortensio, what’s all this about?	modern
Definitely not.	modern
Oh, you wicked scoundrel!	modern
Is this true?	modern
And then his clerk, who went to a lot of trouble with the writing, begged for mine.	modern
Beware Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in, Bear ’t that th' opposèd may beware of thee.	shakespearean
How now, Captain Macmorris, have you quit the mines?	shakespearean
Yes, hand me one too.	modern
I would these dewy tears were from the ground.	shakespearean
Why have your rosy cheeks faded so quickly?	modern
Why, he drinks you with facility your Dane dead drunk; he sweats not to overthrow your Almain.	shakespearean
How dost thou like the Lord Bassanio’s wife?	shakespearean
The king hath heard them, to the which as yet There is no answer made.	shakespearean
One word, sir.	shakespearean
The interim’s mine.	shakespearean
Good gentlemen, let me have leave to speak.	shakespearean
Not a whit.	shakespearean
Where did you learn that song, Fool?	modern
Good morning to you.	modern
I’ll have the work ta'en out And give ’t Iago.	shakespearean
Alack, sir, I am sand-blind.	shakespearean
You may as well undertake to be hanged.	modern
I will settle this matter.	modern
I’m locked in one of them.	modern
That will never happen.	modern
Oh, me, lieutenant!	shakespearean
My story does raise that question.	modern
Is this the Prince’s brother?	shakespearean
Kneel not, gentle Portia.	shakespearean
Though he seems a little old-fashioned, there is much care and courage in this Welshman.	modern
Tis figured in my tongue.	shakespearean
Cassio’s a handsome man.	modern
Well, the difference of a horse!	modern
There’s nothing in her yet.	shakespearean
Good idea.	modern
But he, poor man, by your first order died, And that a wingèd Mercury did bear.	shakespearean
O, belike his majesty hath some intent That you shall be new christened in the Tower.	shakespearean
Just look.	modern
He plans to leave tomorrow.	modern
Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?	shakespearean
Thou bleed’st apace.	shakespearean
Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace, And offer me disguised in sober robes To old Baptista as a schoolmaster Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca, That so I may, by this device at least, Have leave and leisure to make love to her And, unsuspected, court her by herself.	shakespearean
Why, what should you fear?	shakespearean
But if Antony is alive, healthy, friendly with Caesar, and not Caesar’s prisoner, I’ll shower you with gold and pearls.	modern
They’re lying over there, and the poor old man, their father, weeps so piteously over them that the whole audience has joined him in grieving.	modern
I swear by the mass, before I close my eyes to go to sleep, I’ll put in some good fighting, or I’ll lie in the ground dead.	modern
Y'are a baggage, the Slys are no rogues.	shakespearean
I’ve separated them into groups around the island, just as you ordered.	modern
Give it up and go drink.	modern
If I told you that, what would I get out of it?	modern
To find out you.	shakespearean
Content, in faith.	shakespearean
There is no power in Venice Can alter a decree establishèd.	shakespearean
Therefore I do advise you, take this note.	shakespearean
Their battles are at hand.	shakespearean
Why then, your ambition makes it one.	shakespearean
Call forth my household servants.	shakespearean
I tell you, they are not honest men.	modern
But you’re no such man.	modern
You have obtained it.	shakespearean
Why, that’s spoken like an honest drover; so they sell bullocks.	shakespearean
Was it you that he rescued?	modern
Oh, God defend me!	shakespearean
But by the grace of God, she’s mine.	modern
Quiet thy cudgel.	shakespearean
Well, old man, I will tell you news of your son.	shakespearean
And here’s another poem, which I stole from my cousin’s pocket—in her handwriting and all about her adoration for Benedick.	modern
Ay, madam, but returns again tonight.	shakespearean
If you take more or less than exactly a pound, even if it’s just the tiniest fraction of an ounce—if the scale changes by even so much as a hair, you die, and all your property will be confiscated.	modern
Do you want to get married, fool?	modern
Monster, lay to your fingers.	shakespearean
Why then, your other senses grow imperfect By your eyes' anguish.	shakespearean
But it sufficeth that the day will end, And then the end is known.—Come, ho!	shakespearean
Fare thee well, dame.	shakespearean
Gremio, this is no time to compete over how deeply we love Bianca.	modern
Then my children will probably be illegitimate.	modern
In these less dainty times, you’re not breaking the laws of sanctuary to seize him.	modern
We say that Shore’s wife hath a pretty foot, A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue, And that the queen’s kindred are made gentlefolks.	shakespearean
I’m critical by nature.	modern
Come you, sir.	shakespearean
One of you go find the forest ranger.	modern
Sir, sir, that cannot be.	shakespearean
I did not give the lie.	shakespearean
Ay.—Fare you well, fair gentleman.	shakespearean
Know you him?	shakespearean
Who can blame him for acting crazy, when inside he condemns himself for everything he’s done?	modern
The cowslip flowers are her bodyguards.	modern
He’s in  They say he cried out against sherry.	modern
My mind is confused.	modern
If you had been afraid to break an oath with him, the crown you are currently wearing would have graced the head of my child, and both princes would still be alive, not preyed on by worms.	modern
What you wanted is yours.	modern
I’m sorry to have to say this— Help me away from here, dear Charmian!	modern
What do you think?	modern
Prithee, see there!	shakespearean
Be eloquent on my behalf.	modern
Doth Fortune play the huswife with me now?	shakespearean
Get ready, my lord.	modern
He and I will be there.	modern
CALIBAN  Stephano!	modern
I don’t like what you’re asking me to do.	modern
Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I’ll have a suit of sables.	shakespearean
There isn’t a single drop of sincerity in him that could be touched with love.	modern
And O you mortal engines, whose rude throats The immortal Jove’s dead clamors counterfeit, Farewell!	shakespearean
Shall I abide In this dull world, which in thy absence is No better than a sty?	shakespearean
Do your best.	modern
As I do live, my honored lord, ’tis true.	shakespearean
How dare you tell us about God’s laws when you have broken them so savagely yourself?	modern
Kent banished thus?	shakespearean
Ay, boy.	shakespearean
I prithee, tell me who is it quickly, and speak apace.	shakespearean
Check and see if he’s breathing.	modern
How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?	shakespearean
Yes, my lord.	modern
So how can anyone say I’m alone, when the whole world is here to look at me?	modern
About the wood go swifter than the wind, And Helena of Athens look thou find— All fancy-sick she is and pale of cheer, With sighs of love, that costs the fresh blood dear.	shakespearean
I' faith, coz, ’tis he.	shakespearean
Then let God grant me that you’ll be damned for that wicked deed.	modern
Then tell me, if I get your daughter’s love, What dowry shall I have with her to wife?	shakespearean
So do the kings of France unto this day, Howbeit they would hold up this Salic law To bar your Highness claiming from the female And rather choose to hide them in a net Than amply to imbar their crooked titles Usurped from you and your progenitors.	shakespearean
There’s a cliff there that leans precariously over the deep sea.	modern
You shall hear more by midnight.	shakespearean
Are you thinking of buying her?	modern
A man, like you.	modern
But wherefore do you hold me here so long?	shakespearean
Well, sir, in brief, the gown is not for me.	shakespearean
It’s best to rehearse there, because if we do it here in the city, we’ll be bothered by crowds of people and everyone will know the plot of our play.	modern
That from your first of difference and decay Have followed your sad steps.	shakespearean
I think you came to see my mother’s wedding instead.	modern
My uncle the king is to blame for this.	modern
Then they’re cold friends to me.	modern
I was afraid this would happen, because he was a noble, brave man, but I didn’t think he had a weapon.	modern
What news from Genoa?	shakespearean
giving it back to him.	modern
What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?	shakespearean
Either I had to ruin you, or you would have ruined me.	modern
That’s just what he said in the letter.	modern
Nay, that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your marriage as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear it.	shakespearean
Who pays their way?	modern
Don’t move, dog.	modern
Tie him up, I tell you.	modern
Attack the breach in the city wall once more, dear friends, attack it once more—or else let’s close it up with English corpses.	modern

Please do, madam.	modern
That’s it.	modern
With an eye of green in ’t.	shakespearean
No, he has only a little beard.	modern

Yes, the duke of Buckingham and I have just returned from visiting him.	modern
I had it of him.	shakespearean
I’m at your service.	modern
What say the augurers?	shakespearean
Tis three o'clock, and, Romans, yet ere night We shall try fortune in a second fight.	shakespearean
And of women.	shakespearean
Madam, undress you and come now to bed.	shakespearean
We must starve our sight From lovers' food till morrow deep midnight.	shakespearean
Queen of Egypt, greetings!	modern
He mustn’t go to prison.	modern
Well, then, help me.	modern

Who lies i' th' second chamber?	shakespearean
Can anything be made of this?	shakespearean
Therefore I pray you That to our sister you do make return.	shakespearean
Go, bring them in.—And take your places, ladies.	shakespearean
Pity the hand that shed this valuable blood.	modern
But if thy love were ever like to mine— As sure I think did never man love so— How many actions most ridiculous Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy?	shakespearean
Had he his hurts before?	shakespearean
As for this ghost we just saw, he’s a real one, I can tell you that much.	modern
Stay, lovely Helena.	modern
What kind of crude jerk are you?	modern
At home, my lord.	shakespearean
Now, I’ll stand to it, the pancakes were naught and the mustard was good, and yet was not the knight forsworn.	shakespearean
Was that mine?	shakespearean
And when goes hence?	shakespearean
A credulous father, and a brother noble— Whose nature is so far from doing harms That he suspects none, on whose foolish honesty My practices ride easy.	shakespearean
My ear must pull it out.	modern
Our queen and all our elves come here anon.	shakespearean
And I’ll turn you into a spirit like us, so you won’t die as humans do.—Come here, Peaseblossom, Cobweb, Moth, and Mustardseed!	modern
Tis like a demi-cannon.	shakespearean

Hello, Roderigo!	modern
No, please, save it for dinner conversation.	modern
Yes, we should get his support, for his mature presence will make others think well of us and speak out in support of our actions.	modern
What, what, good cheer!	shakespearean
But how did you want it made?	modern
For a taste: If a hart do lack a hind, Let him seek out Rosalind.	shakespearean
I have as much of my father in me as you, albeit, I confess, your coming before me is nearer to his reverence.	shakespearean
Listen to me.	modern
Have an eye to Cinna.	shakespearean
To suckle fools and chronicle small beer.	shakespearean
Go you and tell my daughter I would speak with her.	shakespearean
You have to be patient with me.	modern
You don’t?	modern
When did I ever do you any harm?	modern
She would have died later anyway.	modern
Come on, you can go.	modern
I tell thee, churlish priest, A ministering angel shall my sister be When thou liest howling.	shakespearean
I’m sorry I said anything.	modern
Why no, no more than reason.	shakespearean
Arm myself?	modern

Most rightful judge!	shakespearean
Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.	shakespearean
Worthy sir, greetings!	modern
A thousand, sir, Early though ’t be, have on their riveted trim And at the port expect you.	shakespearean

Am I the motive of these tears, my lord?	shakespearean
Oh, there has been much throwing about of brains.	shakespearean
Why, the night gone by.	shakespearean
Where do you dwell?	shakespearean
I must talk a word with you.	shakespearean
The clock says it’s daytime, but dark night is strangling the sun.	modern
Open, locks, Whoever knocks.	shakespearean
I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us, sir.	shakespearean

Pray you, let’s sit together.	shakespearean
Lucentio, sir.	modern
You’ll both help me, right?	modern
Be merciful, great duke, to men of mold.	shakespearean

Go ahead.	modern
Happily he’s the second time come to them, for they say an old man is twice a child.	shakespearean

How excellent for Antony!	modern
And take good note What Caesar doth, what suitors press to him.	shakespearean
Trinculo, watch out.	modern
Well, sir?	shakespearean
Now get out of here!	modern
All this done, Repair to Pompey’s porch, where you shall find us.	shakespearean
There’s nothing to get upset about.	modern
Do you see something wrong with that?	modern
What say you then to Falconbridge, the young baron of England?	shakespearean
Either there are wars in heaven, or else the world, too insolent toward the gods, provokes them to send destruction.	modern
Is that how it’s going to be?	modern
I’ll tell twenty lies like that, so men will think I graduated from school at least a year ago.	modern
Leave me quickly.	modern
There’s music coming out of thin air.	modern
Does Leonato have a son, my lord?	modern
Startle even the sky with the sound of your lances cracking.	modern
Do you question me as an honest man should do, for my simple true judgment?	shakespearean
Good Master Peaseblossom, I shall desire you of more acquaintance too.— Your name, I beseech you, sir?	shakespearean

You’re a pustule, a sore, a tumor digesting my bloodline.	modern
O Caesar!	shakespearean
Women’s gentle brain Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention, Such Ethiop words, blacker in their effect Than in their countenance.	shakespearean

Thou hast harped my fear aright.	shakespearean
Goodbye, nymph.	modern
Great Queen Juno is coming.	modern
Menas, I’ll not on shore.	shakespearean

You don’t know that?	modern
Nor is he dead, for aught that I can tell.	shakespearean
Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.	shakespearean
I’m not insulting you.	modern
I remember a jumble of impressions, but nothing distinctly.	modern
Go, sirrah, take them to the buttery And give them friendly welcome every one.	shakespearean
This bad weather isn’t good to walk around in.	modern
No eyes in your head til there’s money in your wallet?	modern
If I were in England now, like I was once, and I had even a painted picture of this fish, every fool there would give me a piece of silver to look at it.	modern
The change will be recorded as a precedent, and many bad legal decisions will result.	modern
Did you speak to him?	modern
And I.	shakespearean
Those that “Hobgoblin” call you, and “sweet Puck,” You do their work, and they shall have good luck.	shakespearean
Intelligence is given where you are hid.	shakespearean
What do you think of me?	shakespearean
Me neither.	modern
Nerissa’s got the right idea.	modern
This same is she, and I do give you her.	shakespearean

Why only a few courtiers, my lord of Buckingham?	modern
The whole town will riot!	modern
You speak to Casca, and to such a man That is no fleering telltale.	shakespearean
We must both give and take, my loving lord.	shakespearean
I could do a great job with Hercules, or any other part that requires ranting and raving.	modern
It’s almost ten o'clock.	modern
Just as bad, my lord.	modern
This hard work would be boring and nasty to me, but I’m working for a mistress who makes me enjoy my labor.	modern
Have more than thou showest, Speak less than thou knowest, Lend less than thou owest, Ride more than thou goest, Learn more than thou trowest, Set less than thou throwest, Leave thy drink and thy whore And keep in-a-door, And thou shalt have more Than two tens to a score.	shakespearean
I should not urge thy duty past thy might.	shakespearean
Only for this, I pray you, pardon me.	shakespearean

I now repent I told the pursuivant, As too triumphing, how mine enemies Today at Pomfret bloodily were butchered, And I myself secure in grace and favor.	shakespearean
Take on someone your own size: if you kill me, boy, you’ll have killed a man.	modern
It seldom visits sorrow.	shakespearean

They bleed on both sides.—How is it, my lord?	shakespearean
That part of his reputation will stand.	modern
Yet you killed my children.	modern
But yet I’ll make assurance double sure, And take a bond of fate.	shakespearean
But you know, sirrah, we customarily say that the dead are well.	modern
And so they parted.	shakespearean
Just as you got Milan, I’ll get Naples.	modern
Every second you delay is as long and dull as a journey to South Seas.	modern
This is no way to treat a host who has welcomed you into his house.	modern
And you, sir.	shakespearean
All of you who are looking at her, wouldn’t you swear that she’s a virgin, judging by these outward shows?	modern
Oh, is that all?	shakespearean
I should have been a sore one then.	shakespearean
I cannot speak enough of this content.	shakespearean
Nay, I have ta'en you napping, gentle love, And have forsworn you with Hortensio.	shakespearean

Set you down this,	shakespearean
You know what you know.	modern
Who stocked my servant?	shakespearean
My best way is to creep under his gaberdine.	shakespearean
Do I blame Nature for being so thrifty?	modern

I, not remembering how I cried out then, Will cry it o'er again.	shakespearean
Come on, you.	modern
Another thing, Domitius: Antony wants to see you now.	modern
Thank you for saying that, your Worship, but we’re just the poor duke’s officers.	modern
He can’t like her very long.	modern
Oh, I’m sure you don’t dislike him so much as to wish he were here alone, even though you say this to find out how the rest of us feel.	modern
You may think that I don’t love you.	modern
Go to the platform, Brutus.	modern
Everything will be all right.	modern
I swear I have no idea why he stopped loving me.	modern
Then I heard the trumpets blow twice, and left him there in a trance.	modern
Bring that swinger Orlando here.	modern
To Brutus', to Cassius', burn all.	shakespearean
If thou canst love me for this, take me.	shakespearean
And, Kate, when France is mine and I am yours, then yours is France and you are mine.	shakespearean
She shall be buried with her face upwards.	shakespearean
Alas, poor Harry of England!	shakespearean
Never—O fault!—revealed myself unto him Until some half-hour past, when I was armed.	shakespearean

I will possess you of that ship and treasure.	shakespearean
Be kind to her.	modern
Can you inquire him out and be edified by report?	shakespearean
I will not be faced or bested.	modern
Swear by my sword Never to speak of this that you have heard.	shakespearean
You see her eyes are open.	shakespearean
Has he never before sounded you in this business?	shakespearean
It would’ve been better for you not to have been born at all than to displease me as you did.	modern
And if I, your poor devoted servant, may ask you for one small favor, you will guarantee my happiness forever.	modern
There is no love in you.	shakespearean
It’s still waving to me.	modern
Oh, but I fear.	shakespearean
We owe you love and service forever.	modern
Dishonor not your mothers.	shakespearean
Bring the villain forth.	shakespearean

Damn it!	modern
Good Margaret, run thee to the parlor.	shakespearean
If she be black, and thereto have a wit, She’ll find a white that shall her blackness fit.	shakespearean
I swear ’tis better to be much abused Than but to know ’t a little.	shakespearean
I’ve served you since childhood, but I’ve never done you a better service than telling you to stop.	modern
The question is, how would being king change him?	modern
I did nothing.	shakespearean
Go after her.	shakespearean
Alas, I am the mother of all these others' griefs.	modern
You are a senator!	shakespearean
Which is that adversary?	shakespearean
They are sick?	shakespearean
In its tail.	modern
Have you sent anyone to Bottom’s house?	modern
The moon is down.	shakespearean
Good night, lieutenant.	modern
These lily lips, This cherry nose, These yellow cowslip cheeks Are gone, are gone.	shakespearean
It’s the tragedy of our times that lunatics must lead the blind.	modern
And I’m her father as well.	modern
Let’s sit here and let the music fill our ears.	modern
Are you familiar with the case currently before the court?	modern
Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth, Unapt to toil and trouble in the world, But that our soft conditions and our hearts Should well agree with our external parts?	shakespearean
Dying, sleeping—that’s all dying is—a sleep that ends all the heartache and shocks that life on earth gives us—that’s an achievement to wish for.	modern

Good morrow to my sovereign king and queen, And, princely peers, a happy time of day.	shakespearean
Curse you all, you’re all murderers and traitors!	modern

What we will do, we do upon command.	shakespearean
Run, run, oh, run!	modern
When will there be another like him?	modern
Her head’s declined, and death will seize her but Your comfort makes the rescue.	shakespearean

Messala, I have received these letters explaining that young Octavius and Mark Antony are rushing toward Philippi and bearing down upon us with a mighty power.	modern
Her father loved me, oft invited me, Still questioned me the story of my life From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes, That I have passed.	shakespearean

With God’s help.	modern
Fare thee well.	shakespearean
I didn’t, either.	modern

From the time I was seventeen, over sixty years ago, I have lived in this house, but now I will live here no more.	modern
Do you know anyone who would kill someone for money?	modern
Whatever happens to me, this is a soldier’s kiss.	modern
Yes, I guarantee he won’t drown—even if this ship were as fragile as an eggshell and as leaky as a menstruating woman.	modern
Set it down awhile.	modern
I’ve worked it out.	modern
Don’t tempt me to suicide again.	modern
Oh, speak of that.	shakespearean
Let’s all sink with the king.	modern
To hell with you!	modern
He will, sir, if He wants to.	modern
Boy, I beg you to run to the senate house.	modern
There is one goat for you.	shakespearean

Canidius and the others that left Antony are given hospitality here but no positions of trust.	modern

Come, come, do you think I do not know you by your excellent wit?	shakespearean
Then there must be no lovers in the forest, either, because they’re as good as a clock, marking the lazy foot of time with a sigh every minute and a groan every hour.	modern
I’m more anxious watching you fight than you are in the fight itself.	modern
Keep an eye on her.	modern
When they are gone, then must I count my gains.	shakespearean
No more.	shakespearean
I swear by Jupiter I’ll never revoke this punishment.	modern
It wouldn’t surprise me, my lord.	modern

Let him command me, and I’ll do whatever he asks, no matter how violent.	modern
What said he when he came unto himself?	shakespearean
That I did for him.	shakespearean

By this light, a most perfidious and drunken monster.	shakespearean
And if it doesn’t go well, then you can keep her hidden in a nunnery, the best place for someone with her kind of dirtied reputation—away from the public’s eyes, tongues, mind, and insults.	modern
What do you think of marching to Philippi immediately?	modern
Farewell, good Salisbury, and good luck go with thee.	shakespearean
O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet!	shakespearean

I beg your	modern
I know that young men look forward to their rest.	modern
Well, fare you well, my lord.	shakespearean
Your honor is most welcome.	shakespearean
But oh, how odd it is to have to ask for my child’s forgiveness!	modern
Call you me daughter?	shakespearean
Yes, they are.	modern
At the bottom, any change is for the better.	modern
My daughter!	shakespearean
I wonder if the lion’s going to talk.	modern
In my bedroom window there is a book.	modern
As I vowed, I will unite the York and Lancaster families.	modern

Agrippa, go start the battle.	modern
But stop my house’s ears—I mean my casements— Let not the sound of shallow foppery enter My sober house.	shakespearean
Happy, in that we are not overhappy.	shakespearean
Why of thy thought, Iago?	shakespearean
Away with the dotard!	shakespearean

Yes it is, you half-blood.	modern

Thence I have followed it, Or it hath drawn me rather.	shakespearean
I have no interest in getting mixed up with the devil.	modern

In that case it’s good to be a post.	modern
Yea, by Mass, that it is.	shakespearean
Listen to me, good Shylock.	modern
Why, what’s the problem?	modern
Bear’st thou her face in mind?	shakespearean
My gracious king.	modern
To die, to sleep—to sleep, maybe to dream.	modern
That’s what he said.	modern
That’s what her mother always tells me.	modern

A rebel!	modern
Very impressive.	modern
That’s enough for the senate.	modern
I’m helping  Indeed, sir, find something better to do and get lost for a while.	modern
Do you see that cloud up there that looks like a camel?	modern
I’m not talking about proof yet.	modern
There is one within, Besides the things that we have heard and seen, Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.	shakespearean

But if your soles are worn out, I can mend you.	modern
I am only sorry  He had no other death’s-man.	shakespearean
I cannot tell, except they are busied about a counterfeit assurance.	shakespearean
No more than that, my lord.	modern
I hope so, Lepidus.	shakespearean
Was that the prologue or the inscription on some wedding ring?	modern
Tis he.	shakespearean
Pluck off colorful butterfly wings, and use them to fan moonbeams away from his eyes as he sleeps.	modern
Ha, ha, are you honest?	shakespearean
Escape and make peace with Caesar.	modern
Soon enough.	modern
Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower.	shakespearean

Well, the  Shall we get moving?	modern
Upon the stroke of ten.	shakespearean
It’s nice of you to remind me.	modern
Thou didst smile Infusèd with a fortitude from heaven, When I have decked the sea with drops full salt, Under my burthen groaned; which raised in me An undergoing stomach to bear up Against what should ensue.	shakespearean
Lord, how it looks about!	shakespearean
But if you have the stomach for it, you’ll have all the help from me you need.	modern
Set fire!	modern
What good is covered with the face of heaven, To be discovered, that can do me good?	shakespearean
Listen, in books they say that true love always faces obstacles.	modern
O treachery!	shakespearean
Yes, they’re spirits that I’ve called out of their prisons to perform my whims.	modern
I said “your husband.”—Do you understand that word?	modern
I pray thee, overname them.	shakespearean
We want to hear the will.	modern
You have too much respect upon the world.	shakespearean

I’ll humbly signify what in his name, That magical word of war, we have effected: How with his banners and his well-paid ranks The ne’er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia We have jaded out o’ th’ field.	shakespearean
What, Brutus?	shakespearean
I am he.	shakespearean
Why did you so?	shakespearean
Bring me an exact report of the number of dead on both sides.	modern
You stole it from her?	modern
We would not die in that man’s company That fears his fellowship to die with us.	shakespearean
I hope that, after I tell you my news, you will think better of me.	modern
No, he’s an ordinary guy who ’s got a gentleman for a son, since someone would have to be crazy to let his son become a gentleman before he’s achieved that distinction himself.	modern
Pray you, is he married to Cleopatra?	shakespearean

Trouble us not.	shakespearean
Here, my lord.	shakespearean
That’s a poor example.	modern
That’s why there must be space between you.	modern
No, my dear, you were a little angel who kept me going.	modern
Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.	shakespearean
Conduct me to mine host.	shakespearean
He cannot speak, my lord.	shakespearean
Ay, now am I in Arden, the more fool I.	shakespearean
Keep it from leaving, Marcellus.	modern
Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind, Nor well, unless in mind.	shakespearean
And he is a very paramour for a sweet voice.	shakespearean
May the gods bless you.	modern
We would be resolved, Before we hear him, of some things of weight That task our thoughts concerning us and France.	shakespearean
My noble lord— What dost thou say, Iago?	shakespearean
It would be hard, almost impossible.	modern
It’s too bad some mutual friend of theirs doesn’t introduce them.	modern
But never mind.	modern
God’s my life, where’s the Sexton?	shakespearean
My lord, welcome this man.	modern
Sir, you are very welcome to our house.	shakespearean

And how long is that, think you?	shakespearean
I’ll return the favor.	modern

I’ll do what I can to make you even more comfortable.	modern
Then, my queen, in silence sad, Trip we after the night’s shade.	shakespearean
But, as he was ambitious, I slew him.	shakespearean
Him and his worth and our great need of him You have right well conceited.	shakespearean
Come here, boy.	modern
Kill me tomorrow—but let me live tonight.	modern
Let it not, Brutus.	shakespearean
They are all but stomachs, and we all but food.	shakespearean
Dearly my delicate Ariel.	shakespearean
This isn’t a monster, it’s a devil.	modern
An if I be, sir, is it any offense?	shakespearean
The younger rises when the old doth fall.	shakespearean
Every town and port is crawling with henchmen on the lookout, waiting to capture me.	modern
My necessaries are embarked.	shakespearean
What is between you?	shakespearean
Come on, sister.	modern
And so do I. I think we all do.	modern
That will be ere the set of sun.	shakespearean
May God’s arm strike on our side!	modern
You notorious whore!	modern
Fortune and Antony part here.	shakespearean
The laws are mine, not thine.	shakespearean

You’ve already done something you should be sorry for.	modern
So, in God’s name, let’s march.	modern
Fast work and a little luck are all I need.—Brother, could I have a word with you?	modern
I’m going to rest my head on this little slope.	modern
That’s twice.	shakespearean
Well then, if ever I thank any man, I’ll thank you.	shakespearean
Why, what canst thou tell, my boy?	shakespearean
Forty thousand brothers Could not with all their quantity of love Make up my sum.	shakespearean
It follows, then, the cat must stay at home.	shakespearean
All to our advantage.	modern
Horses are tied by the heads, dogs and bears by the neck, monkeys by the loins, and men by the legs.	shakespearean
And even if you throw everything you possess to the two of them, they’ll battle each other to the death to have it all.	modern
I say thou hast belied mine innocent child.	shakespearean
No, to my cabin.	shakespearean
While I was looking for a flint to light it, I found this paper on the window, sealed up like this, and I’m sure it wasn’t there when I went to bed.	modern
Caesar is upset.	modern
Well, then, what should we do for fun instead?	modern
Leave, you little man.	modern
That’s right, or drinking, swearing, fist-fighting, visiting prostitutes—that kind of thing.	modern
Pluck but his name out of his heart and turn him going.	shakespearean
What’s your business?	modern
Upon his royal face there is no note How dread an army hath enrounded him, Nor doth he dedicate one jot of color Unto the weary and all-watchèd night, But freshly looks and overbears attaint With cheerful semblance and sweet majesty, That every wretch, pining and pale before, Beholding him, plucks comfort from his looks.	shakespearean
And you won’t tell me who you are?	modern
Would you tie me to a whole world of worries?	modern
So please rest.	modern
A lioness hath whelpèd in the streets, And graves have yawned and yielded up their dead.	shakespearean
Why should calamity be full of words?	shakespearean
Oh, pardon me, Signior Gremio, I would fain be doing.	shakespearean
Show us the way.	modern
When it is paid, bring your true friend along.	shakespearean
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, and Brutus is an honorable man.	modern
I’ll head to France soon.	modern
What you have said I will consider, what you have to say I will with patience hear, and find a time Both meet to hear and answer such high things.	shakespearean
It’s undeniable.	modern
So says the Prince and my new-trothèd lord.	shakespearean
You were born from a woman.	modern
You’re looking for Lord Hamlet.	modern
And keep yourself hidden, I command you.	modern
Was it mine?	modern
It’ll help us more than hurt us.	modern
I am dying, Cleopatra, dying.	modern
To Ireland, I.	shakespearean
Why dost thou ask?	shakespearean
Yes, now I’m in Arden, and that makes me the bigger fool.	modern
Believe that you are a foolish little baby for believing these “offers” are something real.	modern
I’m not a slut—I keep myself clean—but I thank God I am ugly.	modern
I will owe thee an answer for that.	shakespearean
The duke’s to blame in this.	shakespearean
I am desperate of my fortunes if they check me.	shakespearean
Who’s shouting?	modern
Thou know’st the first time that we smell the air We wawl and cry.	shakespearean
Then let’s go in and hear what he has to say—though I think I can guess before the Frenchman has uttered a word.	modern
Men may sleep, and when they do they may have their throats with them, and some people say knives have blades.	modern

You know, uncle, A sparrow once raised a cuckoo in its nest Until the cuckoo grew up and bit the sparrow’s head off.	modern
Tarry, Jew.	shakespearean
He is definitely not there, sir.	modern
To do what, Signior?	shakespearean
He attends here in the forest on the duke your father.	shakespearean
I' faith, he’ll have a lusty widow now That shall be wooed and wedded in a day.	shakespearean
It’s no time for jokes: sober up.	modern
Two or three more lords and ladies have been married too.	modern
Oh, let us be merciful anyway.	modern
I hope to God it’s something political, like you think, and not jealousy involving you.	modern
What’s the problem?	modern
Or it’s bottomless, at least: pour affection in one end, and it runs out the other.	modern
Ah, but there is, Horatio, there’s a lot of offense.	modern
Your Highnesses can both attest to the fact that I’ve strived mightily, with all my wits and energy, to bring about this royal meeting between you two imperial Majesties.	modern
Take it thankfully.	shakespearean
Let him look to his bond.	shakespearean
Her reputation is also her own.	modern
He’s waiting outside.	modern
So I recommend you take note of what I’m about to say.	modern
I hope it works out for the best, Lepidus.	modern
Leave you alone!	modern
If you refuse, let an eternal curse fall on you.	modern

Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry— But ’twas thy beauty that provokèd me.	shakespearean
What were these?	shakespearean
He brings you figs.	shakespearean
In that case you should sleep.	modern
The greatest note of it is his melancholy.	shakespearean
Not if the small come first.	shakespearean
Melt Egypt into Nile, and kindly creatures Turn all to serpents.	shakespearean
I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of Rosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he.	shakespearean
Nay, faith, let me not play a woman.	shakespearean
And your lies caused this murder.	modern
Yes, and he’s been carried off the field.	modern
Listen, listen to what I say: whoever strikes first, I’ll run him through with my sword, as sure as I’m a soldier.	modern
Here, sir!	shakespearean
Sit, worthy friends.	shakespearean
How amazing!	modern
Go to thy cold bed and warm thee.	shakespearean
This bigmouth jerk here—( He’ll still die by hanging, not drowning, even if every drop of water in the sea tries to swallow him.	modern
I would not kill thy unpreparèd spirit.	shakespearean
If they’re not honest, they shouldn’t look like they are!	modern
Where’s that snake?	modern
Why, then you must.	shakespearean
God, the best maker of all marriages, Combine your hearts in one, your realms in one.	shakespearean
Oh, the man who avenged her could ask anything of me!	modern
But do not go with it.	shakespearean
I could be convinced if I were like you.	modern
I must Once in a month recount what thou hast been, Which thou forget’st.	shakespearean
Give me an almanac.	modern
Spake you with him?	shakespearean
Doesn’t anyone else want to see this, and hear breath wheezing out from broken ribs?	modern
It’s as silent as a graveyard here.	modern
Go, take your sweetheart and leave him to me.	modern
The greater therefore should our courage be.	shakespearean
But here they come.	shakespearean
And have I ever seemed less than modest or appropriate to you?	modern
Our arms, which can be strong and cruel, and our hearts, filled with brotherly love, embrace you with kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.	modern
Let us to the field.	shakespearean
We are their parents and original.	shakespearean
O Thou, whose captain I account myself, Look on my forces with a gracious eye.	shakespearean
Hid’st thou that forehead with a golden crown Where should be branded, if that right were right, The slaughter of the prince that owed that crown And the dire death of my poor sons and brothers?	shakespearean
We’ll overreach the graybeard, Gremio, The narrow-prying father, Minola, The quaint musician, amorous Litio, All for my master’s sake, Lucentio.	shakespearean
Then so much have I heard.	shakespearean
I humbly thank your ladyship.	shakespearean
Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the matter.	shakespearean
Ask her to help you heal the rift between her husband and you.	modern
In any case, Antonio assured the duke they weren’t with Bassanio on his ship.	modern
Let us deal justly.	shakespearean
Read it, Mark Antony.	modern
Your mother sends her blessings.	modern
Nothing but “low” and “little”!— Why will you suffer her to flout me thus?	shakespearean
Cousins, you all have work to do.—Oh, I beg your pardon.	modern
Oh, a cherubim Thou wast that did preserve me.	shakespearean
Now let Richmond and Elizabeth, the true heirs of each royal house, be joined together!	modern
You may gather more.	shakespearean

Why, he shall never wake until the great Judgment Day.	shakespearean
We’ll have thee, as our rarer monsters are, Painted on a pole, and underwrit, “Here may you see the tyrant.”      I will not yield, To kiss the ground before young Malcolm’s feet, And to be baited with the rabble’s curse.	shakespearean
If his face changed as much as his personality has, I wouldn’t recognize him.	modern
Then the writer imitated the one I composed to my steed, for my horse is my mistress.	modern
I’ll tell you what, Prince: a whole university full of wisecrackers couldn’t change my mood today.	modern
There we go!	modern
How will you get proof?	modern
Well, if you have to go, you have to go.	modern
The barbarous Scythian, Or he that makes his generation messes To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom Be as well neighbored, pitied, and relieved As thou my sometime daughter.	shakespearean

Like a good doctor.	modern
But we’ll obey.	modern
There’s no reason to be afraid.	modern
The man i' th' moon!	shakespearean

Yes, madam, that’s the one.	modern
O upright, just, and true-disposing God, How do I thank thee that this carnal cur Preys on the issue of his mother’s body And makes her pew-fellow with others' moan!	shakespearean
Indeed she’s a most fresh and delicate creature.	shakespearean
No, alas, I found it And I did give ’t my husband.	shakespearean
She lives about twenty miles from Athens, and she thinks of me as a son.	modern
Then I guess beggars are the ones with bodies, while ambitious kings and heroes are just the shadows of beggars.	modern
And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus.	modern
Sir, sir!	modern
Why, sir, he’s not coming.	modern

It was urgent and important enough to require his personal presence.	modern
My dear Regan, your sister’s not worth anything.	modern
Guard them carefully until we decide how to punish them.	modern
Pronounce that sentence then on me, my liege.	shakespearean
Don’t worry about me.	modern
And now, my friends, my courageous and educated friends, do me one small favor.	modern
Enobarbus, welcome.	shakespearean
A sculptor or a painter couldn’t have screwed him up as bad as that, even as an apprentice.	modern
Go disguise yourself as a sea nymph.	modern
I am dying!—My lord, you still have one eye left to see Cornwall punished.	modern
If your Majesties is remembered of it, the Welshmen did good service in a garden where leeks did grow, wearing leeks in their Monmouth caps, which, your Majesty know, to this hour is an honorable badge of the service.	shakespearean
Will you think so?	shakespearean
Lysander, whereto tends all this?	shakespearean
Portia, what are you doing awake?	modern
Tonight I’ll throw through his window a few letters in different handwriting—as if they came from several citizens—all testifying to the great respect Romans have for Brutus, and all alluding to Caesar’s unseemly ambition.	modern
You resent my friends' rise in society, and my own.	modern
But goodbye.	modern
Fret till your proud heart break.	shakespearean
Too late, good Diomed.	shakespearean
Are you my son?	modern
By that kind of logic, I should hate Orlando, since my father hates his father.	modern
It was worse than being a captive in chains.	modern
He is in earnest.	shakespearean
Wipe thine eyes.	shakespearean
But you were with him, weren’t you?	modern
But now I must condemn it.	modern
Nay, he reserved a blanket, else we had been all shamed.	shakespearean
Exclaim no more against it.	shakespearean
Th' occasion speaks thee, and My strong imagination sees a crown Dropping upon thy head.	shakespearean
Is there a scale here to weigh the flesh?	modern
Pray thee, take pain To allay with some cold drops of modesty Thy skipping spirit, lest through thy wild behavior I be misconst’red in the place I go to, And lose my hopes.	shakespearean
She turned to folly, and she was a whore.	shakespearean
Well said.	shakespearean
I pray now, keep below.	shakespearean
I can’t, my lord.	modern
To have a foolish wife.	shakespearean
You’re right, Lysander’s admirable too.	modern
What should I say, sweet lady?	shakespearean
Thou bloodier villain Than terms can give thee out!	shakespearean
I have Immortal longings in me.	shakespearean
Ay, sir; there are a crew of wretched souls That stay his cure.	shakespearean
Hello, spirit!	modern
Is it possible to be wise, bewildered, calm, furious, loyal, and neutral all at once?	modern
We have God and a good cause on our side.	modern

As young as I am, I have observed these three swashers.	shakespearean
Now, noble Buckingham, seal this alliance by embracing my wife’s friends, and make me happy in your unity.	modern
I’ll die like a swan.	modern

The enemy’s losses have been very great, pretty substantial.	modern
Are you not a strumpet?	shakespearean
Scorn and defiance, slight regard, contempt, And anything that may not misbecome The mighty sender, doth he prize you at.	shakespearean
God’s bodykins, man, much better.	shakespearean
Think yourself a baby That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay, Which are not sterling.	shakespearean
The air is sweet and appeals to my refined senses.	modern
O noble judge!	shakespearean
But I, who never knew how to entreat, Nor never needed that I should entreat, Am starved for meat, giddy for lack of sleep, With oaths kept waking and with brawling fed.	shakespearean
A very candid reply.	modern
I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl.	shakespearean
Now we can shout, “Congratulations, congratulations, my lord and lady!” My Lord Bassanio, and my dear lady, I wish you all the joy I can wish for.	modern
Master Constable, you go not the way to examine.	shakespearean
Whoever’s a real friend should strike me dead.	modern
A hundred and sixty-eight hours?	modern
The gods have ordained it to be like this, sir.	modern
I know her answer.	shakespearean
Yes, right away.	modern
Naught that I am, Not for their own demerits, but for mine, Fell slaughter on their souls.	shakespearean
Should I not say, “Hath a dog money?	shakespearean
Ride you this afternoon?	shakespearean
No, if you’re ever late like this again, I’ll refuse to see you.	modern
Hitting his wife?	modern
Marry, heaven forbid!	shakespearean
You keep by land The legions and the horse whole, do you not?	shakespearean
I’ll have some proof.	shakespearean
I did that and more, which brings me to the point of this second meeting.	modern
Where’s the evidence against me?	modern
I loved him, as much as any father ever loved his son.	modern
Words before fighting.	modern
You shall read us the will, Caesar’s will.	shakespearean
So are those crispèd snaky golden locks Which maketh such wanton gambols with the wind, Upon supposèd fairness, often known To be the dowry of a second head, The skull that bred them in the sepulcher.	shakespearean
First, if all obstacles were cut away And that my path were even to the crown As the ripe revenue and due of birth, Yet so much is my poverty of spirit, So mighty and so many my defects, That I would rather hide me from my greatness, Being a bark to brook no mighty sea, Than in my greatness covet to be hid And in the vapor of my glory smothered.	shakespearean
They were poisoned, then.	modern
Miserable England, I foresee for you the most frightening time you have ever experienced.—Come, lead me to the block.	modern
And find I am alone felicitate In your dear highness' love.	shakespearean
Go make thyself like a nymph o' th' sea.	shakespearean
I’m really worried about that.	modern
Leave me, I say.	shakespearean
You absolute villain!	modern
When you see him walking by here (as I’ll make sure he does between twelve and one) you can nab him.	modern
I promise I will.	modern
Now I go, a jolly, thriving wooer, to marry my brother Edward’s young daughter, Elizabeth, because I know Richmond has his eye on her.	modern
The usurer hangs the cozener.	shakespearean
The Duke does greet you, general, And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance, Even on the instant.	shakespearean
God’s will and His pleasure, Captain, I beseech you now, come apace to the king.	shakespearean
Then shall the sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar, and, as I said before, that which is the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of their variance.	shakespearean
No, I’ve had my say.	modern
We didn’t expect Mark Antony to be here.	modern
I’m a nobleman, and I know what I’m doing in assigning this job to you.	modern
His majesty, Tend'ring my person’s safety, hath appointed This conduct to convey me to the Tower.	shakespearean
But his flawed heart— Alack, too weak the conflict to support— 'Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief, Burst smilingly.	shakespearean
Do not presume too much upon my love.	shakespearean
Henry the Sixth, crowned king of France and England while still in his infancy, succeeded him.	modern
Truly, no—no more than is reasonable.	modern
Wouldn’t he be a comfort to us in our travels?	modern
Welcome, my friends.	modern
But he that tempered thee bade thee stand up, Gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason, Unless to dub thee with the name of traitor.	shakespearean
Budge not,” says my conscience.	shakespearean
I don’t think any woman like that exists.	modern
Who asked you to call her?	modern
Why, you scoundrel!	modern
Okay, let’s go!	modern
Be good enough to hear me out.	modern
Send me away, my lord, but don’t kill me!	modern
Tis clean out of the way.	shakespearean
He smiled and said “The better for our purpose.” He was in the right, and so indeed it is.	shakespearean
He said mine eyes were black and my hair black And, now I am remembered, scorned at me.	shakespearean
And it’s too bad, Brutus, that you don’t have any mirrors that could display your hidden excellence to yourself.	modern
Mine ear must pluck it thence.	shakespearean
He and Lepidus are at Caesar’s house.	shakespearean
I’m an honest Puck, and I swear that if we’re lucky enough not to get hissed at, we’ll make it up to you soon.	modern
What, are you answered yet?	shakespearean
He smiled and said, “The better for us.” He’s right, and that’s how it is.	modern
Thou shalt buy this dear If ever I thy face by daylight see.	shakespearean
I charge you, as you hope to have redemption, By Christ’s dear blood shed for our grievous sins, That you depart, and lay no hands on me.	shakespearean
Was the Duke of Milan kicked out of Milan so his children could become kings of Naples?	modern
If you care about your health, you won’t push me any further.	modern
I do the wrong and am the first to start quarrels.	modern
My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.	shakespearean
Didst thou behold Octavia?	shakespearean
Most mighty sovereign, you have no reason to doubt my friendship.	modern
I’ll try to persuade him to put on something more appropriate before going to the church, if it’s at all possible.	modern
The second I saw you, my heart rushed to serve you and be your slave, so here I am now, a patient log-man.	modern
I’ll follow.	modern
We are two lions littered in one day, And I the elder and more terrible.	shakespearean
Truly, an obedient lady.	shakespearean
When she was dying she gave it to me and told me to give it to my wife when I got married.	modern
Why would they do that, my lord?	modern
He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome.	shakespearean
If your love do not persuade you to come, let not my letter.” O love, dispatch all business and be gone!	shakespearean
Did this happen before the King of France returned home?	modern
I won’t have one any bigger.	modern

Wilt thou lift up Olympus?	shakespearean
Weren’t you the one who made him desert Perigouna in the middle of the night, right after he’d raped her?	modern
What a worthy man!	modern
Well, sit we down, And let us hear Barnardo speak of this.	shakespearean
It isn’t good for your health to expose your weak body to the raw, cold morning.	modern
O, now let Richmond and Elizabeth, The true succeeders of each royal house, By God’s fair ordinance conjoin together, And let their heirs, God, if thy will be so.	shakespearean
The devil himself couldn’t say a name I hate more.	modern
I’m backed into a corner with nowhere to run.	modern
But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon, Your buskined mistress and your warrior love, To Theseus must be wedded, and you come To give their bed joy and prosperity.	shakespearean
How can it seem like I’m making fun of you, when my tears prove that I’m sincere?	modern
No, in its tongue.	modern
Fool, speak well of yourself.	modern
Oh, ’tis a gallant king!	shakespearean
Hail, Caesar, and my lord!	shakespearean

Give me your arm.	modern
With Demetrius.	shakespearean

No, to Whitefriars.	shakespearean
We were Christians eno' before, e'en as many as could well live one by another.	shakespearean

Night hangs upon mine eyes.	shakespearean
Get into your cold beds and warm yourselves up.	modern
Big Mars seems bankrupt in their beggared host And faintly through a rusty beaver peeps.	shakespearean

You seem to think no one outside of your bedroom knows what you wish.	modern
Lo, where he comes!	shakespearean
Then that’s the way it’ll be.	modern
Set down, set down your honorable load, If honor may be shrouded in a hearse, Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament Th' untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.	shakespearean
O sun, thy uprise shall I see no more.	shakespearean
I did kill her.	modern
At last, a little shaking of mine arm And thrice his head thus waving up and down, He raised a sigh so piteous and profound As it did seem to shatter all his bulk And end his being.	shakespearean
Didn’t feel like it?	modern
How’s the night going, boy?	modern
If he will not stand when he is bidden, he is none of the Prince’s subjects.	shakespearean
You praise yourself By laying defects of judgment to me, but You patched up your excuses.	shakespearean
Look how the judge yells at a simple thief.	modern
To bed, to bed!	modern
What say you, Bottom?	shakespearean
All the power of his wits have given way to his impatience.	shakespearean
I need people as trustworthy as you.	modern
Most monstrous, oh!	shakespearean
What art thou?	shakespearean
Didst thou not kill this king?	shakespearean
The hand of death hath raught him.	shakespearean
Come with me.	modern
I like your new wig and headdress, though I’d like it more if the hair were a shade browner.	modern
Lady, you know no rules of charity, Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.	shakespearean
Pardon me but I do not know what is “like me.” An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.	modern
He did, very sincerely.	modern
Now, I’ll begin: first, we came down a steep hill, my master riding behind my mistress— Both on one horse?	modern
The treacherous instrument is in thy hand, Unbated and envenomed.	shakespearean
But Macbeth is.	modern
Your crown is crooked.	modern
Get up.	modern
Be bold, and get ready.	modern
Those who have done this deed are honorable.	modern
Go find those herbs for him, before his madness puts his life in danger.	modern
Please keep in mind we’re only here out of spite.	modern
Know then I came before you here a man prepared To take this offer, but Mark Antony Put me to some impatience.	shakespearean
You evil thief, where have you hidden my daughter?	modern
This is not the way To win your daughter.	shakespearean
Well, madam, and in health.	shakespearean
With what I get, I mean, and so do they.	shakespearean
I’ll put it on anyway.	modern
We do not come as minding to contest you, Our true intent is.	shakespearean
What are you going to do now?	modern
God grant him health.	shakespearean
I’ll meet you there.	modern
Come on, good fellow, help me into that armor you’re carrying.	modern
Get thee a wife, get thee a wife.	shakespearean
I did hear him groan, Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans Mark him and write his speeches in their books— “Alas,” it cried, “give me some drink, Titinius,” As a sick girl.	shakespearean
Asses are made to bear, and so are you.	shakespearean
I know young bloods look for a time of rest.	shakespearean
If I tremble then, you can call me a little girl.	modern
I have fled myself, and have instructed cowards To run and show their shoulders.	shakespearean
I speak but in the figures and comparisons of it.	shakespearean
Never hung poison on a fouler toad.	shakespearean
Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper?	shakespearean
But we both obey And here give up ourselves, in the full bent, To lay our service freely at your feet To be commanded.	shakespearean
He is like a god and knows the truth.	modern
Pray you, keep seat.	shakespearean
Confess yourself freely to her, importune her help to put you in your place again.	shakespearean
His father, though I say ’t, is an honest exceeding poor man and, God be thanked, well to live.	shakespearean
The Count sent me an excellent pair of perfumed gloves.	modern
The Prince and Claudio promised by this hour To visit me.—You know your office, brother.	shakespearean
Me too—otherwise I would have had to duel with Claudio.	modern
There’ll be hell to pay for this.	modern
And there’s nothing I can do about it.	modern
Wait, good Beatrice.	modern
Armed, say you?	shakespearean
Would you were not sick!	shakespearean
Don’t ask me to talk about it.	modern
Indeed, they say that the senators plan to establish Caesar as a king tomorrow, and he’ll wear his crown at sea and on land everywhere except here in Italy.	modern
I’ll pheeze you, in faith.	shakespearean

Really, he’s very witty, and full of wise sayings.	modern
I suggest you lay low until his rage cools a little.	modern
Who are all these people?	modern
Out upon her!	shakespearean
Go to bed, and sleep.	modern
Your wife, Fulvia, mustered her army first.	modern
I am not Barbason; you cannot conjure me.	shakespearean
My lord, it’s news I wish I didn’t have to report.	modern
Since his majesty went into the field, I have seen her rise from her bed, throw her nightgown upon her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it, write upon ’t, read it, afterwards seal it, and again return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.	shakespearean
It isn’t daybreak yet.	modern
I swear, I love you.	modern
Goodbye to the horses and the trumpets and the drums, the flute and the splendid banners, and all those proud displays and pageantry of war!	modern
Thou hast described A hot friend cooling.	shakespearean
Who are you?	modern
Or come back to life again and challenge me to a duel in some deserted place.	modern
I have deceived even your very eyes.	shakespearean
I found this pinned to my tent this morning.	modern
It’s time for us to stand guard.	modern
Therefore, O Antony, stay not by his side.	shakespearean
Sa, sa, sa, sa.	modern
Some French agents are already at work in our main ports and are on the verge of declaring open war.	modern
Which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young.	shakespearean
But, hey, this doesn’t mean you’re looking to get married, does it?	modern
Hold your peace.	modern
You’re not going anywhere.	modern
The Queen Of audience nor desire shall fail, so she From Egypt drive her all-disgracèd friend Or take his life there.	shakespearean
I did not think you could have been so angry.	shakespearean
Prithee, if thou lovest me, tell me.	shakespearean
I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love.	shakespearean
A good epithet!	shakespearean
Has it been a quiet night?	modern
A most poor man made tame to fortune’s blows, Who by the art of known and feeling sorrows Am pregnant to good pity.	shakespearean
Go get Aliena ready—because, look, here comes my Rosalind.	modern
This storm protects me from thoughts that would hurt me more.	modern
Therefore, put money in thy purse.	shakespearean
Good-bye for a while.	modern
My Queen and Eros have by their brave examples beaten me to the history books.	modern
I’m off.	modern
One of your tears is worth everything that was won and lost.	modern
Where is Polonius?	modern
There’s a fool sharing my bed now.	modern
Hortensio, to what end are all these words?	shakespearean
Where do you want me to go to respond to these charges?	modern
Inquire the Jew’s house out.	shakespearean
When I’ve revealed my true identity, you’ll be glad you took the time to help me out.	modern
Why, sir, you know no house nor no such maid, Nor no such men as you have reckoned up, As Stephen Sly and old John Naps of Greece, And Peter Turph and Henry Pimpernell, And twenty more such names and men as these, Which never were, nor no man ever saw.	shakespearean
Be patient till the last.	shakespearean
Gave it a judge’s clerk!	shakespearean
I can no more.	shakespearean
Tis no matter.	shakespearean
Have them click their heels together and don’t dare touch a hair of the master’s horse’s tail till they kiss their hands.	modern
He can hold his fingers in a V-shape like this, and Pyramus and Thisbe can whisper to each other through that little crack.	modern
I hate the Moor, and there’s a widespread rumor that he’s slept with my wife.	modern
Hence, make your best of it.	shakespearean
I will o’ertake thee, Cleopatra, and Weep for my pardon.	shakespearean
And will you give me leave?	shakespearean
Delighted to hear you ask so nicely, but I won’t stay in any case.	modern
Methinks the ground is even.	shakespearean
For I am sure mine nails Are stronger than mine eyes.	shakespearean
You need not kneel to me.	modern
Let me borrow a mirror.	modern
Come hither, captain.	shakespearean
Carry me to the jail?	shakespearean
He’s dressed like a freak, a total freak, and not at all like a proper footman or a gentleman’s valet.	modern
His wits are gone.	shakespearean
Tell him a messenger has arrived from my master with good news.	modern
The Roman people are fed up with his arrogance already.	modern
And you won’t until the needy eat.	modern
If I were, I wouldn’t need to ask you what happened.	modern
It was windy on shore too.	modern
My precious Queen, forbear, And give true evidence to his love which stands An honorable trial.	shakespearean
My grandam told me he was murdered there.	shakespearean
It seems to me like we’re still sleeping, still dreaming.	modern
I admit I’m only a woman, but nevertheless I’m the woman Lord Brutus took for his wife.	modern
How durst you, villains, bring it from the dresser And serve it thus to me that love it not?	shakespearean
And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.	shakespearean
Whip him!	modern
Well, we shall see your bearing.	shakespearean
Were you dreaming, Lucius?	modern
Not I.	shakespearean
I have been talking with a suitor here, A man that languishes in your displeasure.	shakespearean
Pardon my crime, sovereign, but not my person.	modern
Ay, marry, must you.	shakespearean
There’s a knocking at the gate.	modern
I prithee, who doth he trot withal?	shakespearean
Carried to Colmekill, The sacred storehouse of his predecessors, And guardian of their bones.	shakespearean
He cannot flatter, he.	shakespearean
Oh, relation Too nice and yet too true!	shakespearean
I did so, and take heed on ’t, Make it a darling like your precious eye.	shakespearean
You lying brat.	modern
God knows I loved my niece, and now she’s dead—slandered to death by cowards who would just as likely fight a real man as I would grab a poisonous snake by the tongue.	modern
Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon, Be it lawful I take up what’s cast away.	shakespearean
It’s a disgrace to us all.	modern
We will greet the time.	shakespearean
What news, man?	modern
How now, what news?	shakespearean
No, because we shouldn’t be doing that—stuff.	modern
Will you have some more sauce to your leek?	shakespearean
I can’t believe that.	modern
He’ll just turn it into a joke and torment the poor woman even more.	modern
She’s like a liar gone to burning hell.	shakespearean
Now, my dear friend, what lucky wind blows you in from Verona?	modern
It doesn’t matter where, so long as it’s not here.	modern
I won’t be a soldier anymore.	modern
You don’t know what money can buy.	modern
Brother— Content yourself.	shakespearean
Her hair, what color?	shakespearean
The main body of the army is expected here any hour now.	modern
They stared at us in confusion.	modern
Come now, keep your oath.	modern
It’s true that your son Lucentio here loves my daughter, and she loves him—or else they’re putting on quite an act.	modern
If you’re as good at pleading to them as I am at saying no to you, this will definitely come to a happy end.	modern
Your highness will have to force me to tell.	modern
I say gudday, Captain Fluellen.	shakespearean
I’ve been here too long.	modern
To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.	shakespearean
Thus doth he force the swords of wicked men To turn their own points in their masters' bosoms.	shakespearean
It cannot be.	shakespearean
For what had he to do to chide at me?	shakespearean
A joint stool.	shakespearean
So, in that case, tell me who’s next in line to inherit the kingdom of Naples?	modern
Upon my soul, a lie, a wicked lie.	shakespearean
No, this fun is not for me.	modern
Please, stop bowing, good sir.	modern
By Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth If thou with Caesar paragon again My man of men.	shakespearean
The English power is near, led on by Malcolm, His uncle Siward and the good Macduff.	shakespearean
For, sir, It is as sure as you are Roderigo, Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago.	shakespearean
I wish they had stayed!	modern
I fear it is too choleric a meat.	shakespearean
Amen to that!	modern
Isn’t there any other rite you can perform?	modern
To her, widow!	shakespearean
Yes, my lord.	modern
I have a beard coming.	shakespearean
Come, Kate, let’s go to bed.	modern
It’s your turn now.	modern
Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?	shakespearean

Whenever you like.	modern
Well, but what time is it?	modern
Thy husband.	shakespearean
What shall I know of thee?	shakespearean
Hark how our steeds for present service neigh.	shakespearean
So shall I clothe me in a forced content, And shut myself up in some other course, To fortune’s alms.	shakespearean
So is the dearest o' th' loss.	shakespearean
What’s the bet?	modern
It’s not friendly, and it’s not ladylike.	modern
You think I’m a sponge, my lord?	modern
Pick up her bed and carry her ladies out of the tomb.	modern
Master young man, you, I pray you, which is the way to Master Jew’s?	shakespearean
We doubt not of a fair and lucky war, Since God so graciously hath brought to light This dangerous treason lurking in our way To hinder our beginnings.	shakespearean
You will pretend to be a schoolmaster and offer to teach the girl.	modern
All, all.	shakespearean
Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.	shakespearean
If they let you off, then we’ll have to assume that Lady Justice has lost all her power.	modern

That will happen before sunset.	modern
Go to, carry this.	shakespearean
Innocent sweethearts, you have no idea who’s responsible for your father’s death.	modern
And like I am for Rosalind.	modern
Let me come clean.	modern
Now grit your teeth and let your nostrils flare.	modern
I do serve you in this business.	shakespearean

Yes, sir.	modern
I’ll go ahead of you, sir.	modern

There is no rest to be had in any bedroom where you are!	modern
In weightier things you’ll say a beggar nay.	shakespearean
I peseech you heartily, scurvy, lousy knave, at my desires, and my requests, and my petitions, to eat, look you, this leek.	shakespearean
That will tell you a lot.	modern
Yes, something you can deny for your own safety: you have been a great thief by sea.	shakespearean

Tell the constable that.	modern
Are you talking about young Master Launcelot?	modern

Is there anyone to give the bride away?	modern
And you, sweet Hero?	modern
Don’t be offended.	modern
Dear father, if you caused this terrible storm with your magic powers, please put an end to it.	modern
It’s not right to obey his orders to let him go alone.	modern
My dearest love, Duncan is coming here tonight.	modern
Wake Duncan with your knocking.	modern
It was some fiend.	shakespearean
Pray thee, go seek him, and bring him to my tent.	shakespearean
It was a vision fair and fortunate.	shakespearean
I’ll limp after you.	modern
We’ll give them present audience.	shakespearean
It cannot be but thou hast murdered him.	shakespearean
Believe me, no.	shakespearean
Wherefore this ghastly looking?	shakespearean
Beseech you, father.	shakespearean
Thy husband knew it all.	shakespearean
Let me see.	shakespearean
I didn’t kill Lysander.	modern
Yes, and paid me well for doing it.	modern
Titinius, if you love me, get on your horse and spur him on until he’s brought you to those troops and back again, so that I can find out whether those troops are friends or enemies.	modern
So do you take her or leave her?	modern
They have to stay there.	modern
No Corin, since you’re old, you cannot guess—even if you were as dedicated a lover in your youth as there ever was, sighing and mooning all night long.	modern
Hark, now I hear them.	shakespearean
A fox you’ve trapped And such a daughter Should both be slaughtered, If my fool’s cap is worth a rope to bind them.	modern
I am mightily abused.	shakespearean
It will make you melancholy, Monsieur Jaques.	shakespearean
We’ll have the barber trim it later, along with your beard.	modern
Claudio deserves to be honored, and Don Pedro has rewarded him accordingly.	modern
Right or not, it’s made you the Earl of Gloucester.	modern
Thank you, brave Cassio.	modern
Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell As when, by night and negligence, the fire Is spied in populous cities.	shakespearean
That only proves how inexperienced you are.	modern
But if you remember, I didn’t tell you to parody the style.	modern
Wherefore’s this noise?	shakespearean
Such wind as scatters young men through the world To seek their fortunes farther than at home, Where small experience grows.	shakespearean
Why, therefore fire, for I have caught extreme cold.	shakespearean
If you really are Sir Rowland’s son, as you’ve just whispered to me—and I can absolutely see the likeness in your face— you are truly welcome here.	modern
Pray you, be careful.	shakespearean
The time is free.	shakespearean
Come, good fellow, put thine iron on.	shakespearean
What a tedious wait!	modern
At least I’ve got some booze to comfort me.	modern
Driven?” Really?	modern
One ever near thee.	shakespearean
And if the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating idiot, does that mean, you think, that we should also be an ass and a fool and a prating idiot?	modern
He were no lion were not Romans hinds.	shakespearean
I thank you, Sir John, with all my heart.	modern
Take it to heart, Dorset.	modern
I really believe your cousin was falsely accused.	modern
Oh, ’tish ill done, ’tish ill done, by my hand, ’tish ill done.	shakespearean
I will not disclose 'em.	shakespearean
Bring me his answers quickly.	modern
Be careful, Signior Baptista, lest you be made the dupe in this business.	modern
I care not if I have.	shakespearean
Then right next to him I saw the murderers, dripping with blood, their daggers rudely covered in gore.	modern
Tis a subject for a sovereign to reason on, and for a sovereign’s sovereign to ride on, and for the world, familiar to us and unknown, to lay apart their particular functions and wonder at him.	shakespearean
I wish you all joy of the worm.	shakespearean
Caesar hanged him for this service.	modern
Thou liest.	shakespearean
If I’m not mistaken, that’s Portia’s voice.	modern
He thinks he still is at his instrument.	shakespearean
In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I looked on.	shakespearean
From seventeen years till now almost fourscore Here livèd I, but now live here no more.	shakespearean
I’m very glad about that.	modern
I’m going back into battle.	modern
That’s the deal.	modern
I pray you, give me leave to go from hence.	shakespearean
Do it, England, For like the hectic in my blood he rages, And thou must cure me.	shakespearean
Then let us both be sudden.	shakespearean
And I’d be surprised if he even did that, for he prefers sports, fun, and friends.	modern
Gentle cousin, Let us go thank him and encourage him.	shakespearean
I heard it not.	shakespearean
But heavenly Rosalind!	shakespearean
First let me talk with this philosopher here.—	modern
O woeful day!	shakespearean
I’ll do so.	modern
With one cut you can be through paying money to Naples.	modern
She was the wife of Caius Marcellus.	shakespearean
Thou liest.	shakespearean
Have you heard anything to the contrary?	modern
Give him this money and these letters, Reynaldo.	modern
Tonight is for celebrating!	modern
This diamond he greets your wife withal, By the name of most kind hostess, and shut up In measureless content.	shakespearean
Right well, dear madam.	shakespearean
Please take them off.	modern
It would be spoke to.	shakespearean
So, thanks to all at once and to each one, Whom we invite to see us crowned at Scone.	shakespearean
It takes a wise father to know his own child.	modern
But if you believe everything they say, you won’t be saved by half of what they do.	modern
How that might change his nature, there’s the question.	shakespearean
I don’t feel anything.	modern
Something there isn’t a word for.	modern
Tell your men as much.	modern
If you say, I hope you will not kill me.	shakespearean
Attend the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester.	shakespearean
To this, add defiance, and tell him, for conclusion, he hath betrayed his followers, whose condemnation is pronounced.” So far my king and master; so much my office.	shakespearean
And as you said (and you said it wisely), it’s good to have someone other than a mother listening in on them, since she can be too partial to him.	modern
Will you break my heart?	modern
Oh, I’d kill that bastard Cassio forty thousand times if I could!	modern
I’ve brought him a present.	modern
It would be a pity to throw them away for nothing, but if it’s a matter of choosing between them and a great cause, then they’re worthless.	modern
Ay, do.	shakespearean
Did you see Octavia?	modern
You unwashed farmworker!	modern
I’ll grow a talker for this gear.	shakespearean
Things have certainly changed!	modern
Do you know where I’m going?	modern
Those island-bred skeletons, terrified for their bones, are an offensive sight on the morning field.	modern
I mean what I say.	modern
For Pyramus is a sweet-faced man, a proper man as one shall see in a summer’s day, a most lovely, gentlemanlike man.	shakespearean
Is she dead?	modern
Tis a very excellent piece of work, madam lady.	shakespearean
Best safety lies in fear.	shakespearean
No one passing by?	modern
I’m going to find out what you’re thinking.	modern
Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and all you peers who owe your lives and duty to this imperial throne.	modern
And I’m telling you it was burnt and dried out.	modern
Ah, ladies, ladies!	modern
By Jupiter, Were I the wearer of Antonio’s beard, I would not shave ’t today.	shakespearean
And when some lowlife protests that  Stop, and eat no more.	modern
You are very welcome here.	modern
Tis false.	shakespearean
Very clever!	modern
Just a moment.	modern
Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand For lifting food to ’t?	shakespearean
Such an expression of despair would only prove that I was guilty.	modern
The candle is burning in your study, sir.	modern
She has a low-pitched voice.	modern
No, he’s a yeoman that has a gentleman to his son, for he’s a mad yeoman that sees his son a gentleman before him.	shakespearean
To celebrate a marriage of true love, and give a gift to the lovers.	modern
Thou still hast been the father of good news.	shakespearean
Oh, I only wish I knew the name of that husband you said he predicted will have a cheating wife!	modern
Her fallow fields are overgrown with weeds, while the blade that should uproot such wilderness lies rusting.	modern
This it is: 'Tis better that the enemy seek us.	shakespearean
The wit you flaunt is like a blunt sword—it can’t hurt anyone, thank God.—My lord, I thank you for your many kindnesses.	modern
I am dumb.	shakespearean
If love has touched you, love has touched you—end of story.	modern
Help to bear this away where my hogshead of wine is, or I’ll turn you out of my kingdom.	shakespearean
How will that kill this marriage?	modern
Why did you once seem lovely to me?	modern
Your grief should not be equal to his worth, because then your sorrow would never end.	modern
No one except her maid and a holy hermit.	modern
And there’s no need for wonder or worry.	modern
And when you get married, I hope I can be married at the same time.	modern
Turning th' accomplishment of many years Into an hour-glass; for the which supply, Admit me chorus to this history; Who, prologue-like, your humble patience pray Gently to hear, kindly to judge our play.	shakespearean
Please, get some excellent music, because tomorrow we want to serenade Lady Hero at her bedroom window.	modern
And yet I think you look with your eyes just like every other woman does.	modern
Keep peace, upon your lives.	shakespearean
You know sometimes he walks four hours together Here in the lobby.	shakespearean
Call up the right Master Constable.	shakespearean
All because of what happened to that brat Rutland?	modern
But this is bad!	modern
Why, she defies me Like Turk to Christian.	shakespearean
All other devils who tempt people to treason patch together some motive, put together from shreds	modern
Knock you here, sir?	shakespearean
He can report, As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt The newest state.	shakespearean
When a great leader dies he doesn’t die alone but, like a whirlpool, draws others with him.	modern
When we’re in love, we don’t see with our eyes but with our minds.	modern
Why shouldn’t I?	modern
But lest my liking might too sudden seem, I would have salved it with a longer treatise.	shakespearean
Wake her not.	shakespearean
Yes, you did.	modern
Why, how now, Hecate!	shakespearean
You can see my ribs so well you can count them.	modern
When it concerns the fool or coward.	shakespearean
Will you play upon this pipe?	shakespearean
Ay, that’s the way.	shakespearean
I this infer: That many things, having full reference To one consent, may work contrariously, As many arrows loosèd several ways Come to one mark, as many ways meet in one town, As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea, As many lines close in the dial’s center, So may a thousand actions, once afoot, End in one purpose, and be all well borne Without defeat.	shakespearean
Or Tuesday noon or at night, or Wednesday morning.	modern
And you have mercy on me too!	modern
It sets you up for a fall.	modern
O villainy!	shakespearean
My dear, let’s go inside and wait for them to arrive.	modern
And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover To entertain these fair well-spoken days, I am determinèd to prove a villain And hate the idle pleasures of these days.	shakespearean
Come on, you’re a fool, and driven to extreme measures by love.	modern
He’s married to Octavia, madam.	modern
I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wrack.	shakespearean
How now, general?	shakespearean
Now, my Lord Constable?	shakespearean
And, good boy, good night.	shakespearean
Even innocents cannot always escape disaster.	modern
The people are on my side, and I’m in charge of the sea.	modern
It is not nighttime now.	modern
Shut that, and ’twill out at the keyhole.	shakespearean
My Lord of Norfolk— Here, most gracious king.	modern
I not doubt He came alive to land.	shakespearean
The noise is coming from over there.	modern
Come, go with me apart.	shakespearean
Will Caesar speak?	shakespearean
I say, it is not lost.	shakespearean
Only to despite them, I will endeavor anything.	shakespearean
The ground feels flat to me.	modern
Then is Caesar and he forever knit together.	shakespearean
I one, my lord.	shakespearean
Sure, since beauty’s power can more easily change a good girl into a whore than the power of goodness can change a beautiful girl into a virgin.	modern
His daughters seek his death.	shakespearean
Here, drink to me.	modern
But what will you be called?	shakespearean
And ere I take this charm from of her sight— As I can take it with another herb— I’ll make her render up her page to me.	shakespearean
But if it is a sin to be selfish about honor, I am the most guilty soul alive.	modern
Ay, but when?	shakespearean
We are free from his tyranny.	modern
How’s the queen?	modern
We will haste us.	shakespearean
Virtue is no hornmaker, and my Rosalind is virtuous.	shakespearean
Not explicitly, but so what?	modern
These foolish drops do something drown my manly spirit.	shakespearean
Macbeth has heard this news and he is so angry that he’s preparing for war.	modern
We never valued this poor seat of England And therefore, living hence, did give ourself To barbarous license, as ’tis ever common That men are merriest when they are from home.	shakespearean
Let’s embrace	modern
We’re very sorry, sir, that you may not live to wear us out with your commands.	modern
For even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to mutiny, whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of Cassio.	shakespearean
I have bankrupted three tailors.	modern
Yes, probably, because I’m staying for lunch.	modern
I am so.	shakespearean
Don’t misunderstand me, sir.	modern
It’s not a false gallop, anyway.	modern
Close by, my master.	shakespearean
I’m ready and waiting.—Give me your hand, Bassanio.	modern
What has the governor of the town decided?	modern
Bring the villain forward.	modern
So the gods keep you And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends.	shakespearean
What is ’t you say?	shakespearean
Are you dreaming or awake?	modern
I mean I will live on whatever I get, like birds do.	modern
It is a massy wheel Fixed on the summit of the highest mount, To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things Are mortised and adjoined, which, when it falls, Each small annexment, petty consequence, Attends the boisterous ruin.	shakespearean
My people do already know my mind And will acknowledge you and Jessica In place of Lord Bassanio and myself.	shakespearean
Speak, I command you.	modern
He rushed away on serious business.	modern
Your brother is young and inexperienced, and because of my affection for you, I’d hate to crush him—though I’d have to, if he challenged me.	modern
Or are you low, vulgar, and of the common people?	modern
Then tell them to treat us well.	modern
Dear sir, forbear!	shakespearean
Oh, if only I were a man!	modern
You are a rude, ragged nurse and an old, sullen playmate for such tender princes.	modern
Follow it, follow it!	modern
Oh, sin can disguise itself so artfully!	modern
Good madam, do.	shakespearean
Look in the calendar and bring me word.	shakespearean
He can’t go in there because of the candle.	modern
He is drunk now.	shakespearean
Eros, would you like to look through a window in Rome and watch your master marching in Caesar’s victory parade, his arms crossed and tied, his head bowed in submission, his face red from shame, while the chariot of triumphant Caesar precedes him, putting the final stamp to his humiliation?	modern
Yes, Caesar, but it’s not gone yet.	modern
What else did you hear?	modern
Good e'en, brother.	shakespearean
If you close the doors on a woman’s wit, it’ll fly out the window.	modern
When he regained consciousness again, he said that if he’d done or said anything wrong, he wanted them to know that it was all because of his sickness.	modern
With the earl, sir, here within.	shakespearean
And so am I, being else by faith enforced To call young Claudio to a reckoning for it.	shakespearean
I am sure I am none such.	shakespearean
I pray you, turn the key and keep our counsel.	shakespearean
We’ll do what you want us to, my lord.	modern
Don’t put me in the stocks.	modern
It’s all stopped.	modern
One of them contains my picture.	modern
Then take this man into your service, Octavius, for he did the final service to my master.	modern
Therefore Make space enough between you.	shakespearean
He used to praise his mother’s nipple before he sucked it.	modern
The town is besieged, and the trumpet calls us to the gap, and we talk and do nothing, by Christ.	modern
His wildness is a threat to all of us—to you, to me, to everyone.	modern
This is how the candle burned the moth.	modern
I am come To bid my king and master aye good night.	shakespearean
And request that she come here.	modern
Cleopatra— Why should I think you can be mine, and true— Though you in swearing shake the thronèd gods— Who have been false to Fulvia?	shakespearean
We’ve driven him all the way back to his camp.	modern
Thy gown?	shakespearean
I pray that the mighty gods defend you!	modern
God doesn’t need to use indirect or illegal means to kill those who have offended him.	modern
Yes, my lord.	modern
It’s yours.	modern
Come hither, fellow.	shakespearean
There were many even more memorable feasts.	modern
But cheer thy heart, and be thou not dismayed.	shakespearean
It took me two years before I had a single tooth.	modern
I’ve been dishonored: I arranged for a friend of mine to marry a common whore.	modern
Well said, old mole!	shakespearean
If thou and nature can so gently part, The stroke of death is as a lover’s pinch, Which hurts, and is desired.	shakespearean
Everyone else will have to stay single.	modern
In honored love.	shakespearean
Madam, it so fell out, that certain players We o'erraught on the way.	shakespearean
Come this way, my lord.	modern
Ere it be demanded, As like enough it will, I would have it copied.	shakespearean
I didn’t have the heart to say no to him.	modern
We still have hope.	modern
What time is it?	modern
Madam, I will.	shakespearean
If you go on thus, you will kill yourself, And ’tis not wisdom thus to second grief Against yourself.	shakespearean
Ah, dear, if that is true, let heaven make poisonous hail grow from my heart, and let the first hailstone drop down my throat.	modern
There’s a strong fellow, Menas.	shakespearean
That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold.	shakespearean
Small but brave in his surroundings, he’s trying to stand up against the wind and rain blowing back and forth.	modern
Villain, I say, knock me at this gate And rap me well, or I’ll knock your knave’s pate.	shakespearean
No wonder, my lord.	shakespearean
But you don’t have any of the symptoms my uncle told me about.	modern
And yesternight, at supper, You suddenly arose and walked about, Musing and sighing, with your arms across, And when I asked you what the matter was, You stared upon me with ungentle looks.	shakespearean
Rest you happy!	shakespearean
Now, if these men have defeated the law and outrun native punishment, though they can outstrip men, they have no wings to fly from God.	shakespearean
The cold wind blows through the hawthorn trees.	modern
There it is.	modern
Is ’t possible that on so little acquaintance you should like her?	shakespearean
What trumpet’s that?	shakespearean
Sit i' th' middle.	shakespearean
A grandam’s name is little less in love Than is the doting title of a mother.	shakespearean
That nothing do but meditate on blood, To swearing and stern looks, diffused attire, And everything that seems unnatural.	shakespearean
Come, more, another stanzo.	shakespearean
I had a son, Now outlawed from my blood.	shakespearean
Drones hive not with me.	shakespearean
But what’s the upshot of her admiration?	modern
Good Father, how foolish are our minds!	shakespearean
Would you buy her, that you enquire after her?	shakespearean
I myself could make A chough of as deep chat.	shakespearean
You stayed well by ’t in Egypt.	shakespearean
Well, I’ll get my revenge.	modern
Get up, I tell you!	modern
You rise to play and go to bed to work.	shakespearean
In the meantime I’ll tell you all, as honestly as I confess my sins to God, how I wooed this beautiful lady, and how she came to love me.	modern
Around three or four o'clock, look for news from the meeting hall.	modern
Let us on heaps go offer up our lives.	shakespearean
But ’tis all one; ’tis alike as my fingers is to my fingers, and there is salmons in both.	shakespearean
Thou knowest that the fashion of a doublet, or a hat, or a cloak, is nothing to a man.	shakespearean
Foolish wench, To th' most of men this is a Caliban And they to him are angels.	shakespearean
I pray you, go Along with me.	shakespearean
Nay, that’s certain.	shakespearean
Varrus and Claudio!	shakespearean
That a monster should be such a natural!	shakespearean
Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here.	shakespearean
O Stephano, hast any more of this?	shakespearean
I’m going to take it from you now.	modern
Me, a penny?	modern
Ah, for my husband, for my dear lord Edward!	shakespearean
He would be crowned.	shakespearean
How are you doing, brother?	modern
I’m sure he’s out there dancing.	modern
That’s some nap.	modern
Why, Rosalind!	shakespearean
If I cut my finger, I’ll use you as a bandage to stop the bleeding.—And your name, sir?	modern
Thus we may see,” quoth he, “how the world wags.	shakespearean
A wonderful miracle!	modern
How do you, Cassio?—Oh, a chair, a chair!	shakespearean
How now, Cassio!	shakespearean
Come ho, and wake Diana with a hymn!	shakespearean
It’s easy to get Desdemona on your side.	modern
Nay, go not back.	shakespearean
I don’t think there’s anywhere I’d rather die than in the king’s company, as his cause is just and honorable.	modern
I don’t make fortunes; I only see them.	modern
how am I beset!— What kind of catechizing call you this?	shakespearean
My sister would be much more offended to have her trusted messenger abused and assaulted just for carrying out her orders.—Put his legs in the stocks.	modern
If not to answer, you might haply think Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty, Which fondly you would here impose on me.	shakespearean
But I’ll go out of spite, to feed off the wasteful Christian.—Jessica, my girl, watch the house.	modern
Yes, you already hurt me in the church, in the town, and in the fields.	modern
God bless thee, and put meekness in thy breast, Love, charity, obedience, and true duty.	shakespearean
Your Highness just told me that I should ride there before you.	modern
What a thrice-double ass Was I, to take this drunkard for a god And worship this dull fool!	shakespearean
He’ll make your palace tremble for this insult, even if it were the mightiest in all of Europe.	modern
Is it they?	shakespearean
I learned to do this from you.	modern
This damned witch Sycorax was kicked out of Algiers for various witching crimes too terrible for humans to hear about.	modern
You pretty lovers are lucky you met me here.	modern
So all the work that oxen and farmers have done in plowing the fields has been for nothing, because the unripe grain has rotted before it was ripe.	modern
You mistake, sir, you mistake, sir.	shakespearean
Bless the isle of Cyprus and our noble general Othello!	shakespearean
And may not young men die as well as old?	shakespearean
Tomorrow, then, I judge a happy day.	shakespearean
Yes, and be brief.	modern
O brave new world, That has such people in ’t!	shakespearean
We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.	shakespearean
And all my armor laid into my tent?	shakespearean
But when shall we set the savage bull’s horns on the sensible Benedick’s head?	shakespearean
Oh, you streetwalker!	modern
Go with my brothers to my English peers.	modern
Don’t ever tell anyone what you’ve seen tonight.	modern
He’s eager to see your head.	modern
And let us swear our resolution.	shakespearean
My Lord Constable, are those stars or suns I saw on the armor in your tent tonight?	modern
Worse than that, she’s polluted herself, so that the fountain is a place where disgusting toads copulate and reproduce!	modern
That’s certain.	shakespearean
Your threats don’t scare me, Cassius, because I’m so secure in my honesty and integrity that they pass me by like a weak breeze.	modern
He’ll be done in time.	modern
For Oberon is passing fell and wrath Because that she, as her attendant hath A lovely boy stolen from an Indian king.	shakespearean
Hear my soul speak.	shakespearean
We have lost your son, I fear, forever.	shakespearean
You may do your will, But he’s a tried and valiant soldier.	shakespearean
He misses not much.	shakespearean
See, my women, Against the blown rose may they stop their nose, That kneeled unto the buds.—Admit him, sir.	shakespearean
Thanks, my good countryman.	modern
My spirit has been as proud as each of yours, my courage as great, and my reason perhaps even better suited to bandy words back and forth and exchange frown for frown.	modern
Give me the letter, sir.	shakespearean
Let’s fall on our swords.	modern
Three in Egypt Cannot make better note.	shakespearean
If our secret’s known, either Caesar or I will die, for I’ll kill myself.	modern
I tax not you, you elements, with unkindness.	shakespearean
Your son Edward, who stabbed my son Edward, is dead.	modern
What a pain.	modern
Mistress, your father requests that you leave your books and come help decorate your sister’s room.	modern
What were I best to say?	shakespearean
I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland.	shakespearean
Happy be Theseus, our renownèd duke.	shakespearean
Come, some music!	shakespearean
I’ll go as fast as I can, madam.	modern
Here comes the Prince and Claudio hastily.	shakespearean
Say our pleasure, To such whose place is under us, requires Our quick remove from hence.	shakespearean
Our master and mistress seeks you.	shakespearean
They are of Norway, sir.	shakespearean
And what a slug Hastings is that he hasn’t even arrived to tell us whether they’re coming!	modern
Die when thou hast lived.	shakespearean
be like the fountain that my children and all my descendants flow from, has rejected me!	modern
Love cools, friendship falls off, brothers divide, in cities	shakespearean
Look how your servants wait on you, each one ready to do whatever you command.	modern
Take it and do ’t, and leave me for this time.	shakespearean
Haste thee for thy life.	shakespearean
I’ll fetch him.	modern
Get up early tomorrow—at the sound of the lark—noble Norfolk.	modern
Are you rich?	modern
Please wait.	modern
Good heavens, man, give them more than that!	modern
Where is the foolish knave I sent before?	shakespearean
His own unkindness That stripped her from his benediction turned her To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights To his dog-hearted daughters.	shakespearean
For you, our swords have blunt edges, too dull to harm you, Mark Antony.	modern
I know you’d never skip school.	modern
We’ve all been duped.	modern
To tell you the truth, I was just going to your house.	modern
I have this present evening from my sister Been well informed of them—and with such cautions That if they come to sojourn at my house I’ll not be there.	shakespearean
How fares our cousin Hamlet?	shakespearean
Now the witch take me if I meant it thus!	shakespearean
If he is, that’s his problem.	modern
And here comes father.	modern
We are your servants, your highness, and as always our house and everything in it is at your disposal, for after all, we keep it in your trust and we’re glad to give you back what’s yours.	modern
The foul’st best fits My latter part of life.	shakespearean
He’s fainted!	modern
O inhuman dog!	shakespearean
My lord, he is but even now gone hence.	shakespearean
Who’s in there?	modern
And so I’m dying.	modern
Dost thou think If I would stand against thee, would the reposal Of any trust, virtue, or worth in thee Make thy words faithed?	shakespearean
Look what I have here.	modern
Think, my lord?” Alas, thou echo’st me As if there were some monster in thy thought Too hideous to be shown.	shakespearean
I see him rouse himself To praise my noble act.	shakespearean
So that in these ten thousand they have lost, There are but sixteen hundred mercenaries.	shakespearean
Hereafter, in a better world than this, I shall desire more love and knowledge of you.	shakespearean
Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you, trippingly on the tongue.	shakespearean
Have you that holy feeling in your souls To counsel me to make my peace with God, And art you yet to your own souls so blind That thou will war with God by murd'ring me?	shakespearean
I don’t have that kind of reputation!	modern
A very weak monster.	shakespearean

In God’s name, who are you?	modern
I’ll go with you, my lord, if you’ll allow me.	modern
Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on, Behold her topped?	shakespearean
We’ll see our husbands before they even have a chance to miss us.	modern

Good sir, be a man, Think every bearded fellow that’s but yoked May draw with you.	shakespearean

Iago is most honest.	shakespearean
If God will be avengèd for this deed, O, know you yet He doth it publicly!	shakespearean
Thou know’st where I will tarry.	shakespearean
No, you can’t do that until you take her hand and, in front of this friar, swear to marry her.	modern
Tis the curse of service.	shakespearean
I’ll cry at nothing, and I’ll always do it when you’re in a good mood.	modern
Tis a point of wisdom.	shakespearean
Oh, to think that the same body that once ruled the world could now patch up a wall!	modern
From this time forth I never will speak word.	shakespearean

Well, I’ll turn pimp and do some occasional pickpocketing.	modern
My stomach’s a little upset.	modern
I’m very sorry I was so hard on him.	modern
I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so.	shakespearean
Still, I’d hate to see my former dreams return.	modern
I will not be long from you.	shakespearean
Ay, my lord.	shakespearean
For any good That I myself have done unto myself?	shakespearean
Hide with a false pleasant face what you know in your false, evil heart.	modern
Your son will have my consent to marry my daughter.	modern
What’s this to my Lysander?	shakespearean
Did you see the weird sisters?	modern

I had been happy if the general camp, Pioneers and all, had tasted her sweet body, So I had nothing known.	shakespearean
Marry, sir, they have committed false report; moreover, they have spoken untruths; secondarily, they are slanders; sixth and lastly, they have belied a lady; thirdly, they have verified unjust things; and, to conclude, they are lying knaves.	shakespearean

All women would be angry with you for doing it, even though I’m the only one who’s hurt by it.	modern
Should I say to you, “Set them free!	modern
A wise man and a fool.	modern
This is the fruits of whoring.	shakespearean

Is there any way to show such friendship?	shakespearean
If you would know your wronger, look on me.	shakespearean
Horny animals!	modern
I don’t know how.	modern
Let’s hear what Antony has to say.	modern
You are very welcome, sir.	shakespearean
Marry, that can Hero!	shakespearean

Though it appear a little out of fashion, There is much care and valor in this Welshman.	shakespearean
The King of Naples, being an enemy To me inveterate, hearkens my brother’s suit, Which was that he, in lieu o' th' premises Of homage and I know not how much tribute, Should presently extirpate me and mine Out of the dukedom, and confer fair Milan With all the honors on my brother.	shakespearean
So you want to put a man in your belly.	modern
Then Antony offered it to him again, and he refused it again (though, in my opinion, he was reluctant to take his hand off it).	modern
Some good friend of his must have died, because nothing else in the world could change a man so much.	modern
I’m wounded.	modern

The sister to my wife, this gentlewoman, Thy son by this hath married.	shakespearean
I think you’ve been frowning too much recently.	modern
I say she shall.—And first begin with her.	shakespearean
My leg’s been cut in two.	modern
God willing, our love and our happiness will only increase as we get older.	modern
That’s an odd thing to say.	modern
She’s obedient—a fine lady.	modern
So are the Prince and Claudio, who accused her Upon the error that you heard debated.	shakespearean
This a dull sight.	shakespearean
I pray you, sir, hold your hand.	shakespearean
O, she that might have intercepted thee, By strangling thee in her accursèd womb, From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done.	shakespearean
I think if we had fought, we would have proven too young and strong for them after all.	modern
Have you had quiet guard?	shakespearean

What should we do with all these rhyming fools that follow us from post to post?	modern
Then give it a nice welcome, as you would give to any stranger.	modern
Yes, my lord.	modern
What have you, my good friends, deserved at the hands of fortune that she sends you to prison hither?	shakespearean
Well, even if he is her father, I’m sure she wouldn’t want to have the head of the old man on her shoulders!	modern
You’ve pretended to be in love with her, singing fake love songs softly at her window by moonlight, and you’ve captured her imagination by giving her locks of your hair, rings, toys, trinkets, knickknacks, little presents, flowers, and candies—things that can really influence an impressionable young person.	modern
Why, here he comes, swelling like a turkey-cock.	shakespearean

O thou foul thief, where hast thou stowed my daughter?	shakespearean
Fly not.	shakespearean
Why didn’t you say “the swift steps” of time instead of the “lazy foot”?	modern
Let no such man be trusted.	shakespearean
What, have you forgotten me?	modern
Not a chance!	modern
Farewell, good Signior Love.	shakespearean
Marry, I’ll teach you.	shakespearean
And from thy hated presence part I so.	shakespearean
God help me, I love you!	modern
If my eyes don’t deceive me, you are my daughter.	modern
All may be well enough.	shakespearean
But as of right this second all these things are yours.	modern
Hanging and wiving goes by destiny.	shakespearean
Give me the goblets.	modern
One, Kate, that you must kiss and be acquainted with.— Where are my slippers?	shakespearean
I think he’s nervous—he’s about to become the savage bull who got domesticated.	modern
I prithee, peace.	shakespearean
You’ll be my wife, dearest, and I’ll serve you forever.	modern
And the greatest sorrow is mine too.	modern
Who can explain this to me?	modern
Utter my thoughts?	shakespearean
Isn’t that your habit?	modern
Well, should we head to the Tower?	modern
I will forget my nature.	shakespearean
We have  And one of them is the criminal Deformed.	modern
I do not know dat.	shakespearean
There’s no doubt that Petruchio’s got quite a catch.	modern
Call Claudio and some of my other men.	modern

You break jests as braggarts do their blades, which, God be thanked, hurt not.—My lord, for your many courtesies I thank you.	shakespearean
What does your grace want?	modern
Is this your speeding?	shakespearean
Tell me which part I’m going to play, then go on.	modern
It’s true, my lord.	modern
A woman who was beautiful but never proud, who could speak well but knew when to be quiet, who dressed well but was never overdressed, who had self-restraint even when she could get what she wanted, a woman who never took revenge, who overlooked it when people hurt her, who was too wise to do anything stupid, who could think without revealing her thoughts, and who could refrain from flirting with men in love with her, that kind of woman, if she ever existed, would— Would do what?	modern
And how he loves Caesar!	modern
Speak, is ’t out o' th' way?	shakespearean
But if you know not this my manners tell me We have your wrong rebuke.	shakespearean
My tale provokes that question.	shakespearean
Who was last with them?	shakespearean
He hasn’t told this to the king, has he?	modern
Noses, ears, lips.	modern
My lord, I have considered in my mind The late request that you did sound me in.	shakespearean
More of this matter cannot I report.	shakespearean
She was, good Curtis, before this frost.	shakespearean
He is not very tall—yet for his years he’s tall.	shakespearean
Help me out of here, quickly!	modern
Where did they disappear to?	modern
No, no, put your hat back on.	modern
I have not ’scaped drowning to be afeard now of your four legs.	shakespearean
O bloody Richard!	shakespearean
Sit down a while And let us once again assail your ears, That are so fortified against our story, What we have two nights seen.	shakespearean
We’ll hear him.—Noble Antony, go up.	shakespearean
Do you?	modern
For this slave, If there be any cunning cruelty That can torment him much and hold him long, It shall be his.	shakespearean
My love thou art, my love, I think.	shakespearean
I thought the clouds were talking to me, the winds were singing to me, and the thunder, like an awful organ pipe, roared Prospero’s name.	modern
To cabin, silence!	shakespearean
Hands, speak for me!	modern
Everything that made me worry about my ships would make me sad.	modern
My thanes and kinsmen, I name you all earls, the first earls that Scotland has ever had.	modern
That which ordinary men are fit for, I am qualified in.	shakespearean
Norfolk, we’re going to have a few blows, right?	modern
Then pardon him, sweet father, for my sake.	shakespearean
Oh well done!	shakespearean
I swear to God, if I hadn’t seen this with my own eyes I’d never believe it.	modern

You gave an excellent performance.	modern
Urge the necessity and state of times, And be not peevish found in great designs.	shakespearean

We’d find that he was a dangerous plotter.	modern
What does that mean, sir?	modern
I must perforce.	shakespearean
Ay, sir.	shakespearean
I beg your pardon.	modern
Even if you’re not a traitor, you’re going to look like one if you run away.	modern
So have your money ready.	modern
Come, the recorders!	shakespearean
Not so sick, my lord, As she is troubled with thick-coming fancies That keep her from her rest.	shakespearean
The Lord protect him from that kingly title!	shakespearean
I don’t think he wants to be anywhere but where he is.	modern
I am Launcelot, your boy that was, your son that is, your child that shall be.	shakespearean
Even someone with a good and virtuous nature might give way to a royal command.	modern
From my house, if I had it— The sixth of July.	shakespearean
Free, madam, no.	shakespearean
Take him to the surgeons.	modern
Thou’st spoken right.	shakespearean
Get thee to a nunnery.	shakespearean
Give me thy hand.	shakespearean
The soul and body rive not more in parting Than greatness going off.	shakespearean
I know my remedy.	shakespearean
If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive, Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword, Which if thou please to hide in this true breast And let the soul forth that adoreth thee, I lay it naked to the deadly stroke And humbly beg the death upon my knee.	shakespearean
Safe in a ditch he bides, With twenty trenchèd gashes on his head, The least a death to nature.	shakespearean
He stayed like that a long time.	modern
To leave his wife, his children, his house, and his titles in a place so unsafe that he himself flees it!	modern
Oh, no, he’s surely not in hell.	modern

Now let me see if I can conster it.	shakespearean
I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee.	shakespearean
For though she’s as like this as a crab’s like an apple, yet I can tell what I can tell.	shakespearean
When I ran into this holy man, those men you mentioned did come to mind, in fact.	modern

He’s staying in the forest with your father now.	modern
She’s more cunning than anyone can imagine.	modern
Out, tawny Tartar, out!	shakespearean
Good my lord, enter here.	shakespearean
If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of Caesar’s, to him I say that Brutus' love to Caesar was no less than his.	shakespearean
Caius Ligarius doesn’t like Caesar, who berated him for speaking well of Pompey.	modern
You are very well met.	shakespearean
I’ll not expostulate with her, lest her body and beauty unprovide my mind again—This night, Iago!	shakespearean
If I remember correctly, I can’t raise the entire three thousand ducats immediately.	modern
I’ll use it for fish bait.	modern
Put your torches out.	shakespearean
In that case, I ask that for the sake of friendship and alliance you let that one item stand with the rest, and bestow your daughter on me.	modern
I think that on a night like this, when the wind blew the trees so gently that they didn’t make a sound,  On a night like this,  On a night like this,  On a night like this,	modern

May they relieve a sick old man’s suffering.	modern
Well, you can go now.	modern
I fear I wrong the honorable men Whose daggers have stabbed Caesar.	shakespearean
Let him sink there so the sea will cover him!	modern
You didn’t offend us, you offended the king.	modern
I will weary you then no longer with idle talking.	shakespearean
What could you possibly ask for?	modern
Dear sister, it’s unfair to me—and unfair to yourself—to turn me into a slave.	modern
A murderer should look like you do, so pale and grim.	modern
I won’t fight you.	modern
I shall faint.	modern
What, with the case of eyes?	shakespearean
Antony’s eyes are fiery red from crying.	modern
My son Came then into my mind, and yet my mind Was then scarce friends with him.	shakespearean
Where am I?	shakespearean
For that reason he sends you this good news—that this very day your enemies, the queen’s relatives, will die at Pomfret.	modern
My dearest relative, I’m begging you, pull yourself together.	modern
And in the morn and liquid dew of youth, Contagious blastments are most imminent.	shakespearean

Oh, so you’d give me all your tediousness?	modern
My lord, he asks that you please visit him tomorrow or the next day.	modern
For three months, well.	shakespearean

What if I had said I had seen him do you wrong?	shakespearean
Be patient until I finish.	modern
My lord is often thus And hath been from his youth.	shakespearean
Me, marry her?	modern
That these crimes are punished so quickly is proof.	modern
Here I am Antony, Yet cannot hold this visible shape, my knave.	shakespearean
Go then, find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and the Count Claudio alone.	shakespearean
His backward voice is to utter foul speeches and to detract.	shakespearean
Oh, a good wish upon you.	shakespearean
When fools cry, you remain stony.	modern
The prince my brother hath outgrown me far.	shakespearean
Her name is Katherina Minola, Renowned in Padua for her scolding tongue.	shakespearean
In cases of defense ’tis best to weigh The enemy more mighty than he seems.	shakespearean
It just happens, the way gentle rain drops on the ground.	modern
It has no fighting spirit.	modern
Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills Unto the legions on the other side.	shakespearean
I’ll do it, sir.	modern
I have fair meanings, sir.	shakespearean
I crave the law, The penalty, and forfeit of my bond.	shakespearean
When powerful kings cave in to flatterers, do you think loyal men will be afraid to speak out against it?	modern
I’ll strike and cry, “Take all.”                                                           Well said.	shakespearean
Take it, God, For it is none but thine.	shakespearean
Don’t you know me still?	modern
If not, the Fates are on the side of the traitors.	modern

Give me access to them, and soon you won’t have to worry about them anymore.	modern
Goneril, you aren’t worth the dust the wind blows in your face.	modern
Ay, sooth, so humbled That he hath left part of his grief with me To suffer with him.	shakespearean
Worthily spoken, Maecenas.	shakespearean
Peace then!	shakespearean
Her curses have made my hair stand on end.	modern
But come on, let’s see you do your dance.	modern
Look, here I have you.	shakespearean
O Banquo, Banquo, Our royal master’s murdered!	shakespearean
But as yet, I swear, I cannot truly say how I came here.	shakespearean

So, in the name of God and all the good that will come of this	modern

O gentle lady, do not put me to ’t, For I am nothing, if not critical.	shakespearean
Mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste, And get you from our court.	shakespearean
Not possible.	shakespearean
We might as well call him a man, since God created him.	modern
That makes me love you even more.	modern
Couch we a while and mark.	shakespearean
Oh God, do I have to remember that?	modern
It shall to the barber’s, with your beard.—Prithee, say on.	shakespearean
I would he had boarded me.	shakespearean

Therefore no marvel though Demetrius Do, as a monster, fly my presence thus.	shakespearean

Are you any kind of philosopher yourself, shepherd?	modern
And if he doesn’t deserve this joy on earth, he’ll never deserve it in heaven.	modern
Thus have I politicly begun my reign, And ’tis my hope to end successfully.	shakespearean
Who’s the spokesman for Edmund, Earl of Gloucester?	modern
If he filled His vacancy with his voluptuousness, Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones Call on him for ’t.	shakespearean
And we will raise your wages.	modern
No doubt, my liege, if each man do his best.	shakespearean
What mean you, madam?	shakespearean
Please come with me.	modern
And why are you so pale?	modern
He’s subhuman, like an animal.	modern
The dirt of a grave must cover your sweet eyes!	modern
How now, Lord Stanley, what’s the news?	shakespearean
Who is so gross That cannot see this palpable device?	shakespearean
You’ve humiliated him, lady: you’ve put him down.	modern
And there were drawn Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women, Transformèd with their fear, who swore they saw Men all in fire walk up and down the streets.	shakespearean
Drink thou.	shakespearean
O Kate, content thee.	shakespearean
It would be excellent if they could make a man halfway between Don John and Benedick.	modern
And you saw how the beggar ran from the mutt?	modern
I would I had your bond, for I perceive A weak bond holds you.	shakespearean
Don’t bother us up here.	modern
And yet I feel it’s very hot and humid, which is bad for my complexion.	modern
Thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers.	shakespearean
Signior Leonato, listen to the friar’s plan.	modern
Where will we meet in the morning?	modern
For your father’s remembrance, be at accord.	shakespearean
Sir, I believe this piece of trash, Bianca, has something to do with all this trouble.—Hang in there, Cassio.—Come here, bring the light.	modern
But I will tell you that I seduced Margaret, the Lady Hero’s waiting woman, tonight.	modern
Sir, he’s with Caesar.	modern
Therefore prepare thyself.	shakespearean
A loud-mouthed, drunken monster.	modern

As it determines, so Dissolve my life!	shakespearean
Alas, what danger will it be to us, Maids as we are, to travel forth so far?	shakespearean
Alas, poor country!	shakespearean
Ay, at Philippi.	shakespearean
I think Belman is just as good, my lord.	modern
Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed, That you do lie so late?	shakespearean
Set me where you stand.	shakespearean
Your names?	shakespearean
We know how much they suffer if we are unkind to them.	modern
Mend” me, you impertinent fellow?	modern
And it’s definitely better to cry because you’re happy than laugh because you’re sad!	modern
The duke must grant me that.	shakespearean
No, though thou call’st thyself a hotter name Than any is in hell.	shakespearean
And how was that one settled?	modern
I fear me both are false.	shakespearean
Woo’t fast?	shakespearean
Unless he have a fancy to this foolery, as it appears he hath, he is no fool for fancy, as you would have it appear he is.	shakespearean
They are wise and honorable, And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.	shakespearean
Reputation, reputation, reputation!	shakespearean
Fair and noble hostess, we are your guests tonight.	modern
It’s women crying, my good lord.	modern
My life is run his compass.	shakespearean

Come, let us to the castle.	shakespearean
Victory is with us.	modern

His eyes are humbler than they used to be.	shakespearean
I will but spend a word here in the house And go with you.	shakespearean
You shall see anon how the murderer gets the love of Gonzago’s wife.	shakespearean
I’ve spent most of my money, and tonight I got beaten up.	modern
What’s going on?	modern
There’s certainly not a boy left alive, and it was done by the cowardly rascals who were running from the battle.	modern
The oars were made of silver, and the oarsmen rowed in time to flute music.	modern
Why, he had none.	shakespearean
Our guiding light is out.	modern
I know she is an irksome brawling scold.	shakespearean
They’re really being spoken, sir, and they’re true.	modern
I had business that made me late.	modern
You want me to say what I’m thinking?	modern
Now, Cinna.—Now, Metellus.—What, Trebonius, I have an hour’s talk in store for you.	shakespearean
Is it his use?	shakespearean
That’s the one, sir.	modern
Wherefore, bold peasant, Darest thou support a published traitor?	shakespearean
But I do see you’re moved.	shakespearean
So they are.	shakespearean
I hope to God Othello’s all right.	modern

But before we reached the end point, Caesar cried, “Help me, Cassius, or I will sink!” And just as Aeneas, the hero who founded Rome, emerged from the fires of Troy with his elderly father Anchises on his shoulder, so I emerged from the Tiber carrying the tired Caesar.	modern
God 'ild you, sir.	shakespearean
It’s time for you to know the whole story.	modern
Some kinds of lowly activities are done for noble reasons.	modern
I think of as many matters as he, but I give heaven thanks and make no boast of them.	shakespearean
What wert thou if the King of Naples heard thee?	shakespearean
Let me see—what think you of falling in love?	shakespearean
When went there by an age, since the great flood, But it was famed with more than with one man?	shakespearean
The thrice three Muses mourning for the death  Of learning, late deceased in beggary.” That is some satire, keen and critical, Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony.	shakespearean
Of all the wonders that I yet have heard, It seems to me most strange that men should fear, Seeing that death, a necessary end, Will come when it will come.	shakespearean
I cannot hear of any that did see her.	shakespearean
So how did it go, sir?	modern
So you got what you deserved, and were locked up in this cave, which is more fitting for the likes of you than a prison would be.	modern
We’re on a tight schedule.	modern
How comes that?	shakespearean
I am armed and well prepared.— Give me your hand, Bassanio.	shakespearean
Did I not bid thee meet me in the park And bring along these rascal knaves with thee?	shakespearean
I have no doubt he got ashore alive.	modern
Well, lead on.	modern
Tis well consented.	shakespearean
What if I strayed no further, but chose here?	shakespearean
That a maiden’s heart hath burned?	shakespearean
I’ll walk around and force the commoners off the streets.	modern

Where is the horse that doth untread again His tedious measures with the unbated fire That he did pace them first?	shakespearean
That’s the one: Leonato’s Hero, your Hero, every man’s Hero.	modern
Oh, sir, the problem goes far deeper than you realize.	modern
Damn it, shut your mouth.	modern
Swear by her foot, so she can stamp out the oath.	modern
He seems cheerful.	modern
I wish she’d never let you come.	modern
My honor wasn’t given; it was only dominated.	modern
The wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse again.	shakespearean
Thou art a soul in bliss, but I am bound Upon a wheel of fire, that mine own tears Do scald like molten lead.	shakespearean
But no metal can— No, not the hangman’s axe—bear half the keenness Of thy sharp envy.	shakespearean
Oh, the difference of man and man!	shakespearean
Before I open this letter, please tell me how my good friend is doing.	modern
Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful prognostication, I cannot scratch mine ear.—Prithee, tell her but a workaday fortune.	shakespearean
With a touch of green in it.	modern
O Iras, Charmian!	shakespearean
But, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow.	shakespearean
I am sure he is in the fleet.	shakespearean
But there’s no bottom, none, In my voluptuousness.	shakespearean
Kind gentlemen, let’s go see poor Cassio dressed.— Come, mistress, you must tell ’s another tale.	shakespearean
Oh, please be quiet.	modern
Look you for any other issue?	shakespearean
Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill.	shakespearean
Go find him.	modern
Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace, Yet have we some revenge.	shakespearean
Marry, before your ladyship, I grant, She puts her tongue a little in her heart And chides with thinking.	shakespearean
He that shall see this day, and live old age, Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbors And say, “Tomorrow is Saint Crispian.” Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars, And say, “These wounds I had on Crispin’s day.”	shakespearean
That’s me you’re talking about, the playful wanderer of the night.	modern
Take me to Octavius.	modern
But let him start off easy by killing one of us.	modern
O Hamlet, what a falling off was there!	shakespearean
I told him what I thought.	modern
Most mighty Caesar, give me some reason, so I won’t be laughed at when I tell them so.	modern
Battered armor, be off.	modern
Ay, Caesar, but not gone.	shakespearean
Oh that I knew this husband, which, you say, must charge his horns with garlands!	shakespearean
Mine too, to join hers.	modern
Please, tell me your cure.	modern
My voice is in my sword.	shakespearean
Then you would have to go beyond heaven, beyond earth.	modern
If not, to tell you I will die is true, but not for love, by God.	modern
I am qualmish at the smell of leek.	shakespearean
You are the best of the cutthroats.	modern
Emilia, run you to the citadel And tell my lord and lady what hath happed.— Will you go on afore?	shakespearean
So do not I.	shakespearean
Out upon it, old carrion!	shakespearean
Still, it stands to reason that he mustn’t betray his fear, as it might dishearten his army.	modern
Tonight I’ll mourn with Hero.	shakespearean
Who’s there?	shakespearean
Report back to him fast and tell him what has happened.	modern
If you don’t repay me on the day we agree on, in the place we name, for the sum of money fixed in our contract, your penalty will be a pound of your pretty flesh, to be cut off and taken out of whatever part of your body I like.	modern
Art thou afeard?	shakespearean
Hurry, hurry!	modern
But, I pray you, let none of your people stir me.	shakespearean
Welcome, destruction, blood, and massacre.	shakespearean
Will you sup with me tonight, Casca?	shakespearean
Right now?	modern
The Moor’s mind has already become infected with my poisonous suggestions.	modern
You mournful princes and grieving gentlemen who have been sharing this burden of grief, now it’s time to cheer each other up with love.	modern
Lend me your hand.	shakespearean
She’s still at the monastery, kneeling and praying for a happy marriage.	modern
Their defeat Does by their own insinuation grow.	shakespearean
Will you two help to hasten them?	shakespearean
You come to me saying, “Shylock, we need money.” You say that!—even though you spat on my beard and kicked me like you’d kick a stray mutt out your front door.	modern
But, first or last, Your fine Egyptian cookery shall have The fame.	shakespearean
It’s dinnertime, my lord.	modern
In every one of the lords' households I have a servant paid to spy for me.	modern
If I live to see it, I’ll never trust his word again.	modern
I wouldn’t think much of it even if it were heavier.	modern
I’ll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead.	shakespearean
Bad people can’t appreciate wisdom or goodness.	modern
You sound like a cattle dealer: that’s the way they sell bulls.	modern
I was reminded of my son, even though I despised my son at that time.	modern
Do you hear what I’m saying, Iago?	modern
Come, sit, sit, and sing me a song.	modern
I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown—though it wasn’t a real crown, just a small circlet—and, as I told you, he refused it once—though in my opinion he would’ve liked to have it.	modern
I’m the one, Hamlet.	modern
He sings at grave- making.	shakespearean
If our father carry authority with such dispositions as he bears, this last surrender of his will but offend us.	shakespearean
That’s the end of the announcement.	modern
They will steal anything and call it spoils.	modern
And he’s not going to do any tomorrow.	modern
Or if you’ve got some buried treasure somewhere, which they say often makes ghosts restless, then tell us about it.	modern
Remember that you call on me today.	shakespearean
The enemy comes on in gallant show.	shakespearean
Off, pluck off!	shakespearean
You have the nerve to call me daughter?	modern
Bring in more wine!	modern
Don’t worry, I won’t.	modern
I did hear The galloping of horse.	shakespearean
Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung With feigning voice verses of feigning love, And stol'n the impression of her fantasy With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gauds, conceits, Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats—messengers Of strong prevailment in unhardened youth.	shakespearean
He is a sick man that would speak with you.	shakespearean
A turn or two I’ll walk To still my beating mind.	shakespearean
This dream has been interpreted all wrong.	modern
That was too much.	modern
If not, he’s plain.	shakespearean
What does my powerful master wish for?	modern
No, faith, lords and great men will not let me.	shakespearean
He followed the old man.	modern
What does Lord Stanley say?	modern
As you can see, these lovers are looking for a place to fight.	modern
Now Margaret’s curse has fallen on our heads, for standing by and doing nothing when Richard stabbed her son.	modern
What shall I do?	shakespearean
If she welcomes him and his hundred knights after I’ve shown how inappropriately he’s behaved— Here, ma'am.	modern
I pray God he be not, I say.	shakespearean
But what love could make my Lysander leave me?	modern
It was, as I have seen it in his life, A sable silvered.	shakespearean
Go bring them here.	modern
My new master is expecting your approach.	modern
Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report.	shakespearean
If they march along unopposed, I will sell my dukedom for a sodden, filthy farm in that craggy isle of Albion.	modern
I remember you took the throne from your brother Prospero.	modern
Good your grace, pardon me.	shakespearean
Follow that gentleman now, and be careful not to make fun of him.	modern
Oh, how fortunate that horse is to have Antony on him.	modern
You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant.	shakespearean
All right, go ahead, keep up your little game, pretend to be sympathetic, but then nudge each other and wink and make faces at me when I turn my back.	modern
Our friends all stay for you.	shakespearean
Nor send you out o' th' way?	shakespearean
Forgive my boldness if I take you up on your words about making magic.	modern
Caesar himself has work, and our oppression Exceeds what we expected.	shakespearean
Of course we will.	modern
Now I want her more than ever.	modern
And what is this useless ceremony of kings?	modern
If you wish.	modern
Tis pitiful, but yet Iago knows That she with Cassio hath the act of shame A thousand times committed.	shakespearean
It is.	modern
Will you hear ’t again?	shakespearean
This jack of Caesar’s shall Bear us an errand to him.	shakespearean
According to the laws of war, you didn’t have to fight a stranger.	modern
Good Captain Blunt, tell the earl goodnight from me, and tell him that by two in the morning I would like him to visit my tent.	modern
Yes, that’s why you have to die.	modern
No, no, we will hold it as a dream till it appear itself.	shakespearean
What’s that noise?	modern
Let me see now,	shakespearean
I am not well in health, and that is all.	shakespearean
An old Italian fox is never that generous, my boy.	modern
Well, we’ll see ’t.	shakespearean
Laertes, I must commune with your grief, Or you deny me right.	shakespearean
What do you think he wants?	modern
We’re searching on land, but he’s lost in the sea.	modern
There will we rehearse, for if we meet in the city we shall be dogged with company, and our devices known.	shakespearean
But I’m as noble as my opponent.	modern
I know you know something about how excellent Laertes is—	modern
But she is now Mark Antony’s wife.	modern
How goes it with my brave Mark Antony?	shakespearean
Poor man!	modern
But listen to me, Gratiano.	modern
It is a kind of history.	shakespearean
I could have saved her.	modern
Not being Fortune, he’s but Fortune’s knave, A minister of her will.	shakespearean
I can’t watch any more.	modern
Come to me, that of this I may speak more.	shakespearean
The king, sir, has bet that in a dozen rounds between you and Laertes, he won’t beat you by more than three hits.	modern
You get only one round.	modern
I am no villain.	shakespearean
Give me particulars.	shakespearean
You’ve heard something you shouldn’t have.	modern
You know me by my habit.	shakespearean
Not he that himself is not so, which is Mark Antony.	shakespearean
I would, my boy.	modern
Where be these bloody thieves?	shakespearean
Come on, you’re being too hard on yourself.	modern
I would be loath to have you overflown with a honey bag, signor.	shakespearean
But his investments are uncertain right now.	modern
Caesar is listening.	modern
Who would do that?	modern
What’s the news!	modern
That done, I will be walking on the works, Repair there to me.	shakespearean
Good morrow, Brutus.	shakespearean
And so it is, truly, and very notably discharged.	shakespearean
Ma'am, my master’s coming.	modern
Where is he gone?	shakespearean
Tis certain then for Cyprus.	shakespearean
Your servants tend.	shakespearean
What do you get to drink, instead of sweet obedience, but poisonous flattery?	modern
Go home to bed, Francisco.	modern
He’s an admirable man.	modern
That were the most if he should   husband you.	shakespearean
Go, vanish into air, away!	shakespearean
He uses his clownishness to disguise his deadly wit.	modern
Not true, not true.	modern
Take care of the lady.	modern
I only wish I could load him up with all the praise he deserves!	modern
No, from the moon, I’m telling you.	modern
It is a common thing— Ha?	shakespearean
Now shall you see the other.	shakespearean
Some food we had and some fresh water that A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo, Out of his charity, who being then appointed Master of this design, did give us, with Rich garments, linens, stuffs, and necessaries, Which since have steaded much.	shakespearean
Their shadows seem A canopy most fatal, under which Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.	shakespearean
But I don’t worry about being deceived because I don’t need to trust.	modern
Let’s follow them.	modern
Lord Gloucester has helped him leave.	modern
I will advise him to speak as he usually does.	modern
No further, sir.	shakespearean
I’m ready now.	modern
Our tattered navy has reassembled and set sail, as formidable as the sea itself.	modern
If you won’t listen to reason, I’ll have to die.	modern
Thank you, sir.	modern
My good man Norfolk, hurry to your post.	modern
That’s definitely true, my lord.	modern
You come with me, uncle of Exeter.	modern
He did bewray his practice, and received This hurt you see striving to apprehend him.	shakespearean
He is as full of courage as of kindness, princely in both.	modern
First of all, Pyramus has to take out a sword to kill himself, which the ladies in the audience won’t be able to stand.	modern
Such a kind father!—Are my horses ready?	modern
Picture the cabin boys climbing around the rigging.	modern
I tell you, there are good men born at Monmouth.	modern
We charge you, in the Prince’s name, stand!	shakespearean
I’d prefer to keep my mistress rather than some lame horse.	modern
Too late, good Diomedes.	modern
Do but go after And mark how he continues.	shakespearean
And do it with all thy heart.	shakespearean
Go get it and bring it to me here in the orchard.	modern
So please your majesty That we may wake the king?	shakespearean
I found it thrown in at the casement of my closet.	shakespearean
Can’t do it.	modern
Now that the wind is favorable, let’s board the ship.	modern
That’s not good.	modern
Therefore speak.	shakespearean
Any man can get drunk sometime.	modern
No, that I don’t remember.	modern
It is for your ears only.	modern
It’s a good shilling, I promise you.	modern
Tell me, Fluellen: did you just come from the bridge?	modern
I think he must have turned into an animal, because I can’t find him anywhere looking like a man.	modern
Wish I could say the same.	modern
We doubt it nothing.	shakespearean
I humbly thank your ladyship.	shakespearean
Never talk to me.	shakespearean
Now, Iras, what think’st thou?	shakespearean
His captain’s heart, Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper And is become the bellows and the fan To cool a gypsy’s lust.	shakespearean
For our losses, his exchequer is too poor; for th' effusion of our blood, the muster of his kingdom too faint a number; and for our disgrace, his own person, kneeling at our feet but a weak and worthless satisfaction.	shakespearean
Then learn this of me: to have is to have.	shakespearean
But yet I feel I fear.	shakespearean
Don’t worry about the consequences.	modern
Now, darting Parthia, art thou struck, and now Pleased fortune does of Marcus Crassus’ death Make me revenger.	shakespearean
This is a most majestic vision, and Harmonious charmingly.	shakespearean
I don’t have any news to report, my lord.	modern
Not now, sweet Desdemona.	shakespearean
You’ll be my witness that I’ve been forced, as Pompey was, to wager all of our freedoms on one battle.	modern
You are too expensive to wear every day.	modern
Which is one?	shakespearean
He’s dead and rotten.	shakespearean
I mean knock his brains out, so he can’t take Othello’s place.	modern
Thank you.	modern
The gods make this a happy day to Antony!	shakespearean
You can’t party your way into dukedoms there.	modern
No one admires speed more than the lazy.	modern
Thou canst tell why one’s nose stands i' th' middle on ’s face?	shakespearean
But what’s the matter, Clarence?	shakespearean
My lord, I have remembrances of yours That I have longèd long to redeliver.	shakespearean
Thyself art coming To see performed the dreaded act which thou So sought’st to hinder.	shakespearean
Oh, my son, what issue is that?	modern
Think you my uncle did dissemble, grandam?	shakespearean
Where is my lord of Gloucester?	shakespearean
I’m satisfied.	modern
Francis Flute, the bellows-repairman?	modern
Ay me!	shakespearean
I can’t believe it.	modern
What are they that do play it?	shakespearean
First, forward to the temple.	shakespearean
What is it, my lord?	modern
Never believe it.	shakespearean
Write to me very shortly, And you shall understand from me her mind.	shakespearean
Have a good morning.	modern
So let him land, And solemnly see him set on to London.	shakespearean
Now get out of here!	modern
It much would please him That of his fortunes you should make a staff To lean upon.	shakespearean
Motley is the only thing to wear.	modern
Nor would we deign him burial of his men Till he disbursed at Saint Colme’s Inch Ten thousand dollars to our general use.	shakespearean
Know, sir, that I Will not wait pinioned at your master’s court, Nor once be chastised with the sober eye Of dull Octavia.	shakespearean
Faith, niece, you tax Signor Benedick too much, but he’ll be meet with you, I doubt it not.	shakespearean
How are you, my love?—Demetrius and Egeus, come with us.	modern
That awful, plodding rhyme sounded like a row of dairy women stomping off to market.	modern
What’s it to you?	modern
Seem they religious?	shakespearean
Yond same black cloud, yond huge one, looks like a foul bombard that would shed his liquor.	shakespearean
I thank you, lady.	modern
O madam, my old heart is cracked, it’s cracked.	shakespearean
He taught me how to recognize a man in love, and you’re not a prisoner of love, I’m sure.	modern
But since the affairs of men are always uncertain, let’s think about the worst that may happen.	modern
I think it would be very hard to arrange for them to have sex while you watched.	modern
Here is the cap your Worship did bespeak.	shakespearean
But give them all a good dinner and look after them well.	modern
I’m sure I can answer for him—he doesn’t know any, either.	modern
I never thought any less of him.	modern
Okay, but when?	modern
I would have such a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant.	shakespearean
If you dare to fight today, come to the field.	modern
Eighty ducats in one shot!	modern
If Caesar chose, Antony would jump at the chance to be his friend.	modern
You cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I will more willingly part withal—except my life, except my life, except my life.	shakespearean
This if she perform, She shall not sue unheard.	shakespearean
Tis he.	shakespearean
Poor Harry of England!	modern
I doubt it, since you weren’t even three at the time.	modern
Come out o' th' storm.	shakespearean
Vouchsafe to those that have not read the story That I may prompt them; and of such as have, I humbly pray them to admit th' excuse Of time, of numbers, and due course of things, Which cannot in their huge and proper life Be here presented.	shakespearean
My own flesh and blood turned against me!	modern
You barely have the heart to tell me, so you can’t possibly have the nerve to do it.	modern
Thou canst compel no more than she entreat.	shakespearean
I’ll break my spells and bring them back to their senses, and they’ll feel like themselves again.	modern
Hail to thee, lady, and the grace of heaven, Before, behind thee, and on every hand, Enwheel thee round!	shakespearean
Or came it by request and such fair question As soul to soul affordeth?	shakespearean
Let go!	shakespearean
Stay, Jaques, stay here for a bit.	modern
What did you say?	modern
Can you help me?	modern
He doesn’t have to care.	modern
Is he still alive?	modern
Indeed, they are disproportioned.	shakespearean
Then none have I offended.	shakespearean
If I could colonize this island, my lord— He’d cultivate weeds on it.	modern
If you will watch his going thence (which I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one) you may take him at your pleasure.	shakespearean
Your two sons?	modern
O, never Shall sun that morrow see!	shakespearean
And after that he came thus sad away?	shakespearean
Far off methinks I hear the beaten drum.	shakespearean
Rob them of the ability to count before the numbers against them overwhelm their courage.	modern
When he loses that, he’ll be drinking salt water, since I’ll never tell him where the freshwater springs are.	modern
Never did faithful subject more rejoice At the discovery of most dangerous treason Than I do at this hour joy o'er myself, Prevented from a damnèd enterprise.	shakespearean
What do I fear?	shakespearean
We’ll all join hands and sing, and bless this place with our fairy grace.	modern
Since you’re letting me leave, I’ll hurry.	modern
I agree— Put a mark next to his name too, Antony.	modern
Even more since you annexed my father’s house and lands.	modern
Since the light of my life has gone out, I’ll stop here.	modern
Call them forth.	shakespearean
Are you a suitor to the girl we speak of, yes or no?	modern
By our beards (if we had them), thou art.	shakespearean
Nod to him, elves, and do him courtesies.	shakespearean
Hie you to horse.	shakespearean

You’ve probably heard about the “change” that’s come over Hamlet—that’s the only word for it, since inside and out he’s different from what he was before.	modern
Make me to see ’t, or at the least so prove it That the probation bear no hinge nor loop To hang a doubt on, or woe upon thy life!	shakespearean
Please, leave me alone.	modern
Look, if you love me, stay.	modern
Tis new to thee.	shakespearean
Prepare the body, then, and follow us.	modern
There thou mayst brain him, Having first seized his books; or with a log Batter his skull; or paunch him with a stake; Or cut his weasand with thy knife.	shakespearean
Now by my George, my Garter, and my crown— Profaned, dishonored, and the third usurped.	shakespearean

Tell her that the entire East shall call her Queen.” Then he nodded and solemnly mounted an armored warhorse, which neighed so loudly it effectively silenced anything I might have said in reply.	modern
My master’s decision.	modern
What you just said may perhaps be true.	modern
I will not fail you.	shakespearean

Mend” me, thou saucy fellow?	shakespearean
Noble friends, let’s kill him boldly but not with anger.	modern
Nothing but songs of death.	shakespearean
There’s no masquerade tonight.	modern
Our army shall In solemn show attend this funeral, And then to Rome.	shakespearean
I won’t keep you very long.	modern
If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility?	shakespearean
What dogs are these!	shakespearean
I’ll bring you thither, my lord, if you’ll vouchsafe me.	shakespearean
Came they not by you?	shakespearean
I’ll not deny him anything I have, No, not my body, nor my husband’s bed.	shakespearean
The desperate tempest hath so banged the Turks, That their designment halts.	shakespearean
That makes you an even bigger villain.—Well, throw him out, and have my officers seize his house and lands.	modern
And why does Lysander deny that he loves you, when he loves you so deeply?	modern
The Venetians are waiting for their food.	modern
What is your pleasure?	shakespearean
If you were my fool, uncle, I’d have you beaten for getting old before your time.	modern
Meet me at the synagogue.	modern
How can Caesar be a tyrant then?	modern
Swum ashore, man, like a duck.	shakespearean
This did I fear, but thought he had no weapon, For he was great of heart.	shakespearean
Tis to be doubted, madam.	shakespearean
Here’s a madman will murder me.	shakespearean
Tyrant, show thy face!	shakespearean
He’s giving her a taste of her own medicine.	modern
These time ambles withal.	shakespearean
For his bounty, There was no winter in ’t, an autumn ’twas That grew the more by reaping.	shakespearean

I beseech you.	shakespearean
Caliban, who now serves me.	modern
Who has wronged him?	modern
When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept.	shakespearean
Now go to the door and stay there till we call.	shakespearean
Oh yes.	modern
Have I not heard great ordnance in the field, And heaven’s artillery thunder in the skies?	shakespearean
But are my brother’s powers set forth?	shakespearean
Belike Some things—I know not what.	shakespearean
A foolish heart, that I leave here behind.	shakespearean
I fight against thee?	shakespearean
My worthy lord, your noble friends miss your company.	modern
May the gods bless Antony today!	modern
Yes, please; unleash your wisdom.	modern
His attendants are desperate, violent men.	modern
We’re still waiting for one more.	modern
We’ve got it now.—Do you see this, my good fellow?	modern
I heard him swear his affection.	shakespearean
Tell him I have moved my lord on his behalf, and hope all will be well.	shakespearean
How can I describe you that will make you appeal to the young woman and will also agree with God, the law, my honor, and her feelings?	modern
Swords out, and tilting one at other’s breasts In opposition bloody.	shakespearean
Oh, what a horrible day!	modern
And here he comes, puffing himself up like a turkey.	modern
Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale Her infinite variety.	shakespearean
I cannot think my sister in the least Would fail her obligation.	shakespearean
Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep.	shakespearean
For all the rest, They’ll take suggestion as a cat laps milk.	shakespearean
I must go and continue the business Fulvia started.	modern
You appeared to me but as a common man.	shakespearean
Let’s do so.	shakespearean
Arise, and say how thou camest here.	shakespearean
I’m afraid that I wrong the honorable men whose daggers have stabbed Caesar.	modern
But yet, madam— I do not like “But yet.” It does allay The good precedence.	shakespearean
Would you rather that Caesar were living and we would all go to our graves as slaves, or that Caesar were dead and we all lived as free men?	modern
I’ll go tell the king about this.	modern
Awake, awake!	shakespearean
Oh, I’m such a coward for living long enough to see my best friend taken before my eyes!	modern
Lie—   With her?	shakespearean
But, Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which I have greater reason to believe now than ever—I mean purpose, courage and valor—this night show it.	shakespearean
It’s partly my own fault, since I followed you here.	modern
Mark Antony will say I’m not well, and to please you I’ll stay at home.	modern
He thinks highly of me.	modern
So why did you laugh when I said that men don’t interest me?	modern
General, be advised, He comes to bad intent.	shakespearean
Can he be angry?	shakespearean
You see me here, gods, a grieving old man, as wretched in his grief as he is in his old age.	modern
No, truly not, although until last night I have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow.	shakespearean
Edmund, farewell.	shakespearean
I could munch your good dry oats.	shakespearean
If he isn’t what he might be, then I wish to God he were!	modern
Then let the trumpets sound The tucket sonance and the note to mount, For our approach shall so much dare the field That England shall couch down in fear and yield.	shakespearean
Tis destiny unshunnable, like death.	shakespearean
There’s nothing like good hay, really sweet hay.	modern
Truly, she makes a very good report o’ th’ worm.	shakespearean
Let not the heavens hear these telltale women Rail on the Lord’s anointed.	shakespearean
Make your best use of this.	shakespearean
My father’s studying hard, so he won’t see you.	modern
The king is not responsible for it.	modern
The odds is gone, And there is nothing left remarkable Beneath the visiting moon.	shakespearean
Without contradiction I have heard that.	shakespearean
Thank you, master.	modern
Your royal father’s murdered.	shakespearean
All right Ursula, as Beatrice arrives, we’ll be walking up and down this alley and speaking about nothing but Benedick.	modern
I pray you tell Benedick of it and hear what he will say.	shakespearean
You couldn’t beat the two of them apart.	modern
I don’t want to take another man’s second-hand goods.	modern
If I default, he’ll pay you.	modern
So should we you, if you should be our king.	shakespearean
Thy truth then be thy dower.	shakespearean
Thou wilt write to Antony?	shakespearean
What will you do with ’t, that you have been so earnest To have me filch it?	shakespearean
No, I think there’s more to this than you’re letting on.	modern
Are you really saying these things, or am I dreaming?	modern
Dear gods in heaven, what’s the reason for this?	modern
Sir, do you know who I am?	modern
Are you fair?	shakespearean
And you called the fairy creature harmless, monster.	modern
And thither will I straight to visit him.	shakespearean
Go relax now.	modern
Hear the ambassadors.	shakespearean
Because we come to do you service and you think we are ruffians, you’ll have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse.	shakespearean
Really, my lord, why are you so excessively sad?	modern
Mean you his majesty?	shakespearean
I understand now.	modern
Nor I.	shakespearean
Marry, sir, we say we are none.	shakespearean
A devil, a born devil on whose nature Nurture can never stick, on whom my pains, Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost.	shakespearean
I only speak right on.	shakespearean
My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.	shakespearean
He needs to see you right away.	modern
From that place I shall no leading need.	shakespearean
As surely as I am the queen of Egypt, Antony, you’re blushing, which means you’re Caesar’s servant.	modern
I should be angry with you if the time were convenient.	shakespearean
Signior Baptista, I’m actually in a bit of a hurry.	modern
She’s so good at sewing, and a wonderful musician.	modern
You can’t trust them.	modern
I will, sir.	modern
Goodbye, good Mr. Love.	modern
I never knew a woman who loved a man so much.	modern
When they shall see The face of Caesar, they are vanishèd.	shakespearean
Neighbors, God speed.	shakespearean
Then one of you will warp and pull away—and there goes your marriage.	modern
Until the day we die, my lord.	modern
I Richard’s body have interrèd anew, And on it have bestowed more contrite tears Than from it issued forcèd drops of blood.	shakespearean
Actually, it’s not so unusual when you think about it.	modern
I’ll bear thy blame And take thy office from thee, on my peril.	shakespearean
In a king, the sight is unbearable.	modern
I had most need of blessing, and “Amen” Stuck in my throat.	shakespearean
Music, moody food Of us that trade in love.	shakespearean
Die and be damned, and  It is well.	shakespearean
Come on, get ready.	modern
Oh cowardly conscience, how you’re torturing me!	modern
We don’t want you to think we came here to offend you, except that we want to offend you with our good intentions.	modern
At every house I’ll call.	shakespearean
My books and instruments shall be my company, On them to look and practice by myself.	shakespearean
It’s another Hero!	modern
No news of them?	shakespearean
Wake when some vile thing is near.	shakespearean
The sentence I’ve passed down on her is firm and unshakeable.	modern
And what your Highness suffered under that shape, I beseech you take it for your own fault and not mine, for, had you been as I took you for, I made no offense.	shakespearean
May the gods destroy you!	modern
We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us.	shakespearean
Oh, I see.	modern
He’s a friend of the Duke Alençon’s.	shakespearean
I don’t have a lord.	modern
This is rebellion.	modern
I guess not—for good reason, as you’ll soon hear.	modern
By this sword, I’ll kill whichever one of you makes the first thrust.	modern
Then, you conclude, my grandam, he is dead.	shakespearean
All right then, back home we go.	modern
Oh, listen to me, night— Who is this?	modern
Sir, she is mortal.	shakespearean
I will not till I please.	shakespearean
You can go straight to hell!	modern
Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth, The better part of my affections would Be with my hopes abroad.	shakespearean
Know you not he has?	shakespearean
Hail, mortal.	shakespearean
Fury, Fury!—Get over there, Tyrant, there.	modern
Oh, forgive me!	modern
Repent and avoid damnation.	modern
Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover’s grace.	shakespearean
Well, we’ll speak more soon.	modern
How canst thou woo her?	shakespearean
I’ll reward you for your troubles.	modern
Draw, you rogue, for though it be night yet the moon shines.	shakespearean
If it were nothing, you wouldn’t need to hide it.	modern
Better, since your lordship was nice enough to ask.	modern
Well, I will call Beatrice to you, who I think hath legs.	shakespearean
Only the adulterous and abominable Antony abandons you, giving his power to a whore who turns that power against us.	modern
So-so” is good, very good, very excellent good.	shakespearean
Yes, in a very gentlemanly way.	modern
Oh, that bird from hell!	modern
This guy has legs like a man but fins for arms!	modern
If not, he foams at mouth and by and by Breaks out to savage madness.	shakespearean
What are you doing here in Elsinore?	modern
My most dear Gloucester!	shakespearean
Take these too.	modern
As I descended?	shakespearean
On a trice, so please you, Even in a dream were we divided from them And were brought moping hither.	shakespearean
The fault of it I’ll answer.	shakespearean
It stops me here, it is too much of joy.	shakespearean
I am changed.	shakespearean
I’m a prince by birth, Miranda—maybe even a king now; though I wish I weren’t—and normally I wouldn’t put up with carrying these logs any more than I’d let flies breed in my mouth.	modern
It’s time that we brought our armies into the field.	modern
My mistress here lies murdered in her bed— Oh, heavens forfend!	shakespearean
Play, I say!	modern
This is how they do it, sir: they measure the depth of the Nile, according to certain marks made on the walls of the Pyramid.	modern
I swear I’ll cuff you if you strike again.	shakespearean
Let him mount the pulpit.	modern
He knows not what he says, and vain it is That we present us to him.	shakespearean
Why didn’t the jerk come back to me when I called him?	modern
Did he receive you well?	shakespearean
Please spare my innocent wife and children!—Kind warden, please stay with me for a while.	modern
Tis true indeed, so your daughter says.	shakespearean
What news do you have?	modern
He died like someone who had practiced how to toss away his most cherished possession as if it were a worthless a piece of garbage.	modern
Let’s go!	modern
Call Cleopatra what the Romans call her.	modern
And I hope you won’t think badly of me.	modern
That’s great.	modern
But try to control your speech.	modern
Hath the fellow any wit that told you this?	shakespearean
Run as if your life depended on it.	modern
If you say one more word, I’ll punish you, maybe even hate you.	modern
Follow his chariot, like the greatest spot Of all thy sex.	shakespearean
Strike on the tinder, ho!	shakespearean
I mean, with my head in your lap?	modern
It was just two days ago that I tripped you and beat you up in front of the king.	modern
His leg is but so-so—and yet ’tis well.	shakespearean
But it was—as I received it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine—an excellent play, well digested in the scenes, set down with as much modesty as cunning.	shakespearean
As for myself, it was Greek to me.	modern
Come, uncle Exeter, Go you and enter Harfleur.	shakespearean
This is a stem Of that victorious stock, and let us fear The native mightiness and fate of him.	shakespearean
I might do something I’ll be sorry for.	modern
I do not set my life in a pin’s fee, And for my soul—what can it do to that, Being a thing immortal as itself?	shakespearean
Lysander and myself will fly this place.	shakespearean
It is impossible they bear it out.	shakespearean
Nay, when I have a suit Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed It shall be full of poise and difficult weight And fearful to be granted.	shakespearean
But yet I run before my horse to market.	shakespearean
Is ’t gone?	shakespearean
No, not a penny.	modern
Oh, that’s nothing, believe me, sir.	modern
Do you get what I’m saying, Reynaldo?	modern
May God, who is the best matchmaker, join your hearts and realms in one.	modern
But please tell me, is my boy—God rest his soul—alive or dead?	modern
Talk not, Signior Gremio.	shakespearean
O, one too much by thee!	shakespearean
That eye that told you so looked but asquint.	shakespearean
Scape being drunk for want of wine.	shakespearean
Shame, eternal shame, and nothing but shame!	modern
Just looking at him gives me heartburn.	modern
We’re not invading England out of ambition or greed, but out of love—dear love!—and my father’s right to his kingdom.	modern
What a righteous judge!	modern
Pat, pat.	shakespearean
We are the makers of manners, Kate, and the liberty that follows our places stops the mouth of all find- faults, as I will do yours for upholding the nice fashion of your country in denying me a kiss.	shakespearean
I had a son, whom I’ve legally disowned.	modern
But now I see our weapons are like straws, our strength like a straw’s weakness, and our weakness past comparison, so that we seem to be the thing we most are not.	modern
Except that he has not yet agreed to address you in this form and with this title—in French,  And even this I’m willing to grant if you request it.	modern
Would you walk out with me, sir?—Oh, Desdemona— Yes, my lord?	modern
She said she wished she hadn’t heard it, but she also wished there was a man like me for her.	modern
When they see the face of Caesar, they will vanish.	modern
As you from crimes would pardoned be, Let your indulgence set me free.	shakespearean
I am called.	shakespearean
I wish I could live longer.	modern
Run and proclaim it in the streets.	modern
And you’re not loyal, like us.	modern
If that her breath will mist or stain the stone, Why then, she lives.	shakespearean
Sometimes I appeared in many places at once.	modern
How can that be, when you have the voice of the king himself for your succession in Denmark?	shakespearean
I’ll be your wife if you’ll have me.	modern
Peace, children, peace.	shakespearean
Every hour he comes out with some horrible new offense that puts us all on edge.	modern
I pray that God will let me learn from women like that—not to follow their bad example, but to avoid it!	modern
Edmund, you deserve me to be your woman.	modern
But don’t delay.	modern
The honest men.	modern
Sir, we came to see your father’s funeral.	modern
In short, when I told him how firmly opposed I was to his hideous plan, he pulled out his sword and lunged at my defenseless body, cutting my arm.	modern
Yea, marry, let them come before me.	shakespearean
No offense taken.	modern
Now all the late travellers are hurrying to reach their inns.	modern
Please, leave me alone.	modern
Come not near Casca.	shakespearean
We age and die because they wear us out.	modern
And you’re not suited for any place except hell.	modern
There be some such, no question.	shakespearean
Madam, I wish it may.	shakespearean
And thus a while the fit will work on him.	shakespearean
Can we have some water please here?— Come and wash, Kate, make yourself at home.	modern
Come like shadows and depart in the same way!	modern
Is not this true?	shakespearean
For I will make him tell the tale anew Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when He hath, and is again to cope your wife.	shakespearean
Where hast thou been, my heart?	shakespearean
The sailors are all below deck, sleeping both from their labor and from a magic spell I cast over them.	modern
I have often led you, now you must carry me, my good friends—and take my thanks for everything.	modern
What is the matter, lady?	shakespearean
Oh, she is Ten times more gentle than her father’s crabbed, And he’s composed of harshness.	shakespearean
Tis true.	shakespearean
Where do you live, pretty young man?	modern
So good-bye for now.	modern
You know I would never approve a war against my own cause.	modern
Is Signior Lucentio at home, sir?	modern
Thus may we gather honey from the weed And make a moral of the devil himself.	shakespearean
Let’s get started right away.	modern
Let him come, and kindly.	shakespearean
For first was he contract to Lady Lucy— Your mother lives a witness to that vow— And afterward by substitute betrothed To Bona, sister to the king of France.	shakespearean
Talk to him.	modern
I had a Richard too, and thou did’st kill him; I had a Rutland too; thou holp’st to kill him.	shakespearean
She says you’re going to marry her.	modern
The question of his death is enrolled in the Capitol.	shakespearean
Not really, unless you were ugly.	modern
You’re mistaken.	modern
Get you to bed again.	shakespearean
It astounds me that such a weak man could beat the whole world and carry the trophy of victory alone.	modern
Fast asleep?	modern
He wonders to what end you have assembled Such troops of citizens to come to him, His grace not being warned thereof before.	shakespearean
Tis a good dullness, And give it way.	shakespearean
Twill be a storm.	shakespearean
Beg another of thy daughters.	shakespearean
Do I, sir?	modern
I couldn’t bear to obey all of your daughters' harsh orders.	modern
Thus die I, thus, thus, thus.	shakespearean
I wish them all safe trips home.	modern
May heaven bless you.	modern
I was not born to die on Brutus' sword.	shakespearean
If you would not, it were a good sign that I should quickly have a new father.	shakespearean
Upon mine honor, Myself, my brother, and this grievèd count Did see her, hear her, at that hour last night Talk with a ruffian at her chamber window Who hath indeed, most like a liberal villain, Confessed the vile encounters they have had A thousand times in secret.	shakespearean
Though science can explain them away, disasters still come after eclipses.	modern
Why have you stol’n upon us thus?	shakespearean
Soft, Caesar.	shakespearean
I can only walk a little way with you, since I’m waiting here.	modern
I do not desire he should answer for me, and yet I determine to fight lustily for him.	shakespearean
Sweet flowers for a sweet girl.	modern
In his livery Walked crowns and crownets.	shakespearean
It is a wise father that knows his own child.	shakespearean
But let it rain; I’ll survive.	modern
Amen, if you love her, for the lady is very well worthy.	shakespearean
Well then, take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man.	shakespearean
Doesn’t everyone want a wife like that?	modern
I could well wish courtesy would invent some other custom of entertainment.	shakespearean
I wish none of this had happened, given the situation here, and your rank.	modern
No, come on, don’t make me play a woman.	modern
How canst thou make me satisfaction?	shakespearean
The castle’s gently rendered.	shakespearean
Dismiss me.	shakespearean
But give me your hand, Menas.	shakespearean
Caesar’s talking.	modern
Since no man of aught he leaves knows, what is ’t to leave betimes?	shakespearean
I doubt not but his friends will turn to us.	shakespearean
Croak not, black angel.	shakespearean
Away, I do beseech you, both away.	shakespearean
Tis mightiest in the mightiest.	shakespearean
Portia, forgive me this enforcèd wrong, And in the hearing of these many friends I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes Wherein I see myself—     Mark you but that!	shakespearean
But I’m sorry—I’m not allowed to let you visit them.	modern
It shall be seven o'clock before I get on my horse.	modern
What would my lord?	shakespearean
So get down on your knees and beg mercy from the duke.	modern
Their villainy goes against my weak stomach, and therefore I must cast it up.	shakespearean
I would give all my glory for a mug of ale and safety.	modern
Believe me, my friend, since I have the power to stop the prosecutors.	modern
As I get to leech him, I will show some mercy.	modern
Draw the curtains—so, so, so.	shakespearean
Shall I go fetch your nightgown?	shakespearean
Most royal majesty, I crave no more than hath your highness offered.	shakespearean
You killed this king, didn’t you?	modern
What, there’s going to be a masquerade?	modern
Now, princely Buckingham, seal thou this league With thy embracements to my wife’s allies And make me happy in your unity.	shakespearean
Oh, then belike you fancy riches more.	shakespearean
You can push my buttons, but you can’t play me for a fool.	modern
But a harsh hearing when women are froward.	shakespearean
Lorenzo, I commit into your hands The husbandry and manage of my house Until my lord’s return.	shakespearean
By my troth, a good song.	shakespearean
Will they stop working when their voices mature?	modern
My lord, I’ll do it right away.	modern
Tis proper I obey him, but not now.	shakespearean
I did say so When first I raised the tempest.	shakespearean
It’s him!	modern
Touch me not so near.	shakespearean
Get on your nightgown, lest occasion call us And show us to be watchers.	shakespearean
Come shake hands with Laertes, Hamlet.	modern
Name what part I am for and proceed.	shakespearean
Are you thinking about me?	modern
What ho, Horatio!	shakespearean
She is not sick, my lord, but she is troubled with endless visions that keep her from sleeping.	modern
I’m off to Venice.	modern
Two of my brother’s men bound!	shakespearean
Yes, I have gained my experience.	shakespearean
We’ve finished our business.	modern
Alas, who knows?	shakespearean
You, will you join with me?	modern
Why “let it strike”?	modern
Be thrifty.	modern
His soul is as dull as night and dark as the underworld.	modern
Are not you he?	shakespearean
Now is the day we long have lookèd for.	shakespearean
A lively young one!	modern
Caesar might act like that.	modern
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus, The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.	shakespearean
So you’d better not stay with him, Antony.	modern
That’s for to me to decide.	modern
Oh, one child is one too many!	modern
Now, lords, don’t let slip any opportunity that might be advantageous for our expedition.	modern
I prithee take the cork out of thy mouth, that I may drink thy tidings.	shakespearean
Why, then, ’tis none to you, for there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.	shakespearean
Mend when thou canst.	shakespearean
Lend me your cloak, Sir Thomas.	modern
Or had a friend who would be a man for me!	modern
Come, come, you are too clever for your own good.	modern
This my mean task Would be as heavy to me as odious, but The mistress which I serve quickens what’s dead And makes my labors pleasures.	shakespearean
Who said that I was disdainful, and that I got all my best lines out of a bad joke book?!	modern
I am a villain.	modern
And also to find out the size of the enemy army.	modern
The king hath strictly charged the contrary.	shakespearean
Did my father hit one of my attendants for scolding his fool?	modern
How shall we find the concord of this discord?	shakespearean
Yet in faith, if you did, it would not much approve me.	shakespearean
Call the slave again.	shakespearean
No, I had to do something.	modern
And servants of the Danish king.	modern
And like I am for Ganymede.	modern
Twill not be seen in him there.	shakespearean
Cicero, I’ve seen storms in which the angry winds split old oak trees, and I’ve seen the ocean swell, rage, and foam, as if it wanted to reach the storm clouds, but never before tonight, never until now, have I experienced a storm that drops fire.	modern
Therefore to our best mercy give yourselves Or, like to men proud of destruction, Defy us to our worst.	shakespearean
He’s made me a little sore, I’ll admit.	modern
Isn’t it completely moral to kill him now with this sword—and an easy conscience?	modern
This clearing will be the stage, and this hawthorn bush will be our dressing room.	modern
I’ll wait till his beard grows in, if you’ll just hurry up and tell me what chin that beard is on.	modern
Is ’t so, my lords of England?	shakespearean
No, it’s Casca, someone who’s going to work with us.	modern
Go on.	modern
Arrest him: he’s a friend of the duke of Alençon’s.	modern
He hath left them you And to your heirs forever—common pleasures, To walk abroad and recreate yourselves.	shakespearean
Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh.	shakespearean
Let’s proceed on our march to Birnam.	modern
How canst thou thus for shame, Titania, Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?	shakespearean
And I am such a tender ass, if my hair do but tickle me, I must scratch.	shakespearean
Don’t tell me that.	modern
Come, let’s have one more extravagant night.	modern
Oh, I could weep My spirit from mine eyes.	shakespearean
Yes, indeed, and all the King’s men, the Duke of Milan and his fine son too.	modern
When it comes to defense, it’s best to assume that the enemy is more powerful than he seems.	modern
You must know that the snake will act according to his nature.	modern
Now, we go contentedly to freedom—not banishment.	modern
Twas a rough night.	shakespearean
I’ll have grounds More relative than this.	shakespearean
All-seeing heaven, what a world is this!	shakespearean
That we should, with joy, pleasance revel and applause, transform ourselves into beasts!	shakespearean
They smile at me that shortly shall be dead.	shakespearean
Well, let’s watch it.	modern
I charge thee, hence, and do not haunt me thus.	shakespearean
Either there is a civil strife in heaven, Or else the world, too saucy with the gods, Incenses them to send destruction.	shakespearean
Sheathe your dagger.	shakespearean
Don’t worry about me.—Your sister and the duke are here.	modern
Enough, cousin.	modern
It cannot be.	shakespearean
I desire no more delight Than to be under sail and gone tonight.	shakespearean
Oh, yes, Benedick has returned and is as cheerful as ever.	modern
And even now, but now, This house, these servants, and this same myself Are yours, my lord’s.	shakespearean
The gentleman she danced with told her you insulted her.	modern
Know you not the cause?	shakespearean
I’ll give the Queen a hearing and grant her requests if she either throws her dishonored friend out of Egypt or kills him.	modern
With a needle and thread.	modern
Now boast thee, Death, in thy possession lies A lass unparalleled.	shakespearean
You have done well by water.	shakespearean
No, add a couple more syllables.	modern
Be it so.	shakespearean
There’s my hand.	shakespearean
By our beards (if we had them), you are a knave.	modern
Look at all the devoted servants who work for their masters their whole lives for nothing but their food, and then when they get old they’re terminated.	modern
You’re defending an impostor?	modern
The English have promised me thousands of troops.	modern
Get thee to bed, Francisco.	shakespearean
Order them to escape.	modern
What were you before this?	modern
It’s time to end it, good lady.	modern
God give me joy to wear it, for my heart is exceeding heavy.	shakespearean
My father Is hard at study.	shakespearean
Beautifully, sir, beautifully!	modern
Now welcome, Kate, and bear me witness all That here I kiss her as my sovereign queen.	shakespearean
You don’t have to tell us what Lord Hamlet said.	modern
Be invisible to everyone except yourself and me.	modern
You have known what you should not.	shakespearean
Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel, That thou mayst shake the superflux to them And show the heavens more just.	shakespearean
The princess is the better Englishwoman.—I' faith, Kate, my wooing is fit for thy understanding.	shakespearean
Will she go now to bed?	shakespearean
That’s completely beside the point.	modern
Alack, sir, he is mad.	shakespearean
Tomorrow night, when the moon shines on the water and decorates the grass with tiny beads of pearly light (the time of night that always hides runaway lovers), we plan to sneak out of Athens.	modern
I’ve locked it up in my room.	modern
Leave it to his discretion, and let us listen to the moon.	shakespearean
He’s gone, and his wife’s dead.	modern
I swear by my sword— Swear by your shield, too!	modern
Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays and all.	shakespearean
Repent but you that you shall lose your friend, And he repents not that he pays your debt.	shakespearean
Ma'am, I’d rather— I know your lady Goneril doesn’t love her husband.	modern
O piteous spectacle!	shakespearean
What’s going on, my love?	modern
This imaginary suitor for Katherina—I’d buy him the best horse in Padua if he’d get here quickly, woo her, marry her, take her to bed, and rid the house of her.	modern
Do they attract big audiences?	modern
Thank the lord for alliances!	modern
I dare swear he is no hypocrite but prays from his heart.	shakespearean
She gave it to him, and he gave it to his whore.	modern
No, sit down.	modern
Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar, And let me show you him that made the will.	shakespearean
If you would conjure in her, you must make a circle; if conjure up Love in her in his true likeness, he must appear naked and blind.	shakespearean
If he shows up tomorrow, I’ll give him what’s coming to him.	modern
Did you hear the news that’s going around?	modern
Good, good, the justice of it pleases!	shakespearean
The king would speak with Cornwall.	shakespearean
Come on, niece, I’m sure you love him.	modern
I think all tendencies to jealousy were burned out of him by the sun of his native land.	modern
No grave upon the earth shall clip in it A pair so famous.	shakespearean
O, now I need the priest that spake to me!	shakespearean
Le Roy?	modern
On one and the same trip Claribel found a husband in Tunis, and Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife where he was shipwrecked; Prospero found his dukedom on a poor island; and all of us found ourselves when we lost control of ourselves.	modern
I must be one of these same dumb wise men, For Gratiano never lets me speak.	shakespearean
Here it is.	modern
Let me shake your hand.	modern
Whither will you that I go To answer this your charge?	shakespearean
For my Lord Lackbeard there, he and I shall meet, and till then peace be with him.	shakespearean
In ten days time, if you’re found within twenty miles of the court, you’ll die for it.	modern
In that case, he’s more obliged to you than I am.	modern
The ground indeed is tawny.	shakespearean
Here, hang them on this clothesline.	modern
What miracle will he work next?	modern
They say Edgar, his banished son, is with the Earl of Kent in Germany.	shakespearean
In saying so, you shall but say the truth.	shakespearean
I’ll flatter anyone who flatters me—though what I’ve accomplished on land cannot be denied.	modern
Set down your venerable burden, And let him feed.	shakespearean
The two of them were separated during the storm.	modern
It is not moonlight now.	shakespearean
Edmund and I have talked, And more convenient is he for my hand Than for your lady’s.	shakespearean
Quiet there!	modern
I await justice.	modern
Put a lot of cash together.	modern
All that served Brutus, I will entertain them.	shakespearean
Now, Death, you can boast that you have an incomparable girl in your possession.	modern
What’s the matter with you, madam?	modern
Why should he stay, whom love doth press to go?	shakespearean
The great contention of the sea and skies Parted our fellowship—   But, hark!	shakespearean
My countrymen— Silence!	modern
Get thee hence.	shakespearean
Why, then ’tis time to arm and give direction.	shakespearean
Look how she carries on with him!	modern
With all my heart.	shakespearean
You charge me most unjustly.	shakespearean
My father wasn’t a traitor.	modern
Don’t you know, master, that some men’s best qualities do them in?	modern
Is it possible Fulvia is dead?	modern
How do you, madam?	shakespearean
Oh, oh, oh!	modern
Why, she’s a lamb, a dove, a child compared to him!	modern
Now come along.	modern
I am content.	shakespearean
Uncouple in the western valley.	shakespearean
Here comes the lady.	shakespearean
Maybe the king is sending you to the Tower to have you renamed.	modern
Happily, amen!	shakespearean
Good evening to your Worship, good Captain James.	modern
So let me be brief here.	modern
There’d be no work.	modern
And supportable To make the dear loss have I means much weaker Than you may call to comfort you, for I Have lost my daughter.	shakespearean
What do the priests say?	modern
Don’t make me do it, my lady.	modern
Why, stay and hear me speak.	shakespearean
You amaze me.	shakespearean
Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse Full of crusadoes.	shakespearean
Oh, it is monstrous, monstrous.	shakespearean
What then?	modern
Are you planning to go out?	modern
Oft have I heard of sanctuary men, But sanctuary children, ne'er till now.	shakespearean
You promised to tell me.	modern
Oh, really?	modern
The friar’s ready.	modern
Why, whose is it?	shakespearean
I must love you and sue to know you better.	shakespearean
Then learn this from me: if you have something, you have it.	modern
I have no long spoon.	shakespearean
Gentlemen, calm down.	modern
Uncle, your Grace knows how to bear with him.	shakespearean
Who is ’t that cried?	shakespearean
And she goes down at twelve.	shakespearean
I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-headed monster.	shakespearean
Come, march to wakes and fairs and market towns.	shakespearean
If you struggle to bring down a tyrant, you will sleep peacefully when the tyrant is killed.	modern
You don’t have to worry about any of these lords, my lady.	modern
How say you by this change?	shakespearean
Oh, do but think You stand upon the rivage and behold A city on th' inconstant billows dancing, For so appears this fleet majestical Holding due course to Harfleur.	shakespearean
Well then, if I’ve ever thanked a man, I’ll thank you now.	modern
He bears too great a mind.	shakespearean
All I have to do is remove it.	modern
He’s quite simply the smartest working-man in Athens.	modern
We’ll both be safer if we go separate ways.	modern
But fathers who are rich Make their children kind.	modern
O dear son Edgar, The food of thy abusèd father’s wrath, Might I but live to see thee in my touch, I’d say I had eyes again!	shakespearean
Go, by this token.	shakespearean
I have looked upon the world for four times seven years, and since I could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury I never found man that knew how to love himself.	shakespearean
Come, come, wrestle with thy affections.	shakespearean
O most bloody sight!	shakespearean
I do believe that these applauses are For some new honors that are heaped on Caesar.	shakespearean
Iago has kept his word.	modern
Here, Fluellen, stick this in your cap.	modern
Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother’s hand Of life, of crown, of queen at once dispatched, Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,	shakespearean
That’s her torment.	shakespearean
The sun will not be seen today.	shakespearean
Masters, never speak, we charge you, let us obey you go with us.	shakespearean
I will lower my voice.	modern
Call you this “gamut”?	shakespearean
I’ll none of it.	shakespearean
She’s alive.	modern
Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well.	shakespearean
But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.	shakespearean
The next, our ship— Which, but three glasses since, we gave out split— Is tight and yare and bravely rigged as when We first put out to sea.	shakespearean
Tis strange, my Theseus, that these lovers speak of.	shakespearean
I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.	shakespearean
Caesar himself is in trouble and there are more adversaries than we expected.	modern
There was no end to his generosity.	modern
Tom’s chilly.	modern
And, gentle Puck, take this transformèd scalp From off the head of this Athenian swain, That, he awaking when the other do, May all to Athens back again repair And think no more of this night’s accidents But as the fierce vexation of a dream.	shakespearean
Did you call me?	modern
Go you with me and I will use your skill.— Good cousin, have a care this busy time.	shakespearean
So when should he come?	modern
Well, to be on the safe side—so I don’t go back on my promise—I plan to get myself married to a wealthy widow within the next three days.	modern
Dost thou call me fool, boy?	shakespearean
Very pale, sir.	modern
I have led you oft; carry me now, good friends, And have my thanks for all.	shakespearean
I will run.	shakespearean
What does the tyrant?	shakespearean
I wish him joy of her.	shakespearean
Look down, you gods, And on this couple drop a blessèd crown, For it is you that have chalked forth the way Which brought us hither.	shakespearean
I pray thee tell me truly how thou lik’st her.	shakespearean
A thousand thousand!	shakespearean
May the god of power make me, the weakest of the weak, your mediator.	modern
There I shall see mine own figure.	shakespearean
If he looks serious, he must need money.	modern
I am not to you known, Though in your state of honor I am perfect.	shakespearean
I saw Othello’s visage in his mind, And to his honors and his valiant parts Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate.	shakespearean
What is ’t o'clock?	shakespearean
Who’s that?	modern
They are beaten, sir, and our advantage serves For a fair victory.	shakespearean
The nasty devil’s biting my butt.	modern
How long hath she been thus?	shakespearean
Oh, that we then could come by Caesar’s spirit And not dismember Caesar!	shakespearean
Where is she now?—What, will my hands never be clean?—No more of that, my lord, no more of that.	modern
And Caesar shall go forth.	shakespearean
What’s this?	modern
One of our ships has reported that it saw most of their fleet shipwrecked.	modern
By my life, I do.	shakespearean
What should the wars do with these jigging fools?	shakespearean
We are men, my lord.	modern
Where, sir?	modern
To cut my penalty from that bankrupt man over there.	modern
I have it ready for you.	modern
You should listen to reason.	modern
I’ll do that.	modern
Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake?	shakespearean
So he does indeed.	shakespearean
Weren’t you banished on pain of death?	modern
But I see you’re troubled.	modern
This would drink deep.	shakespearean
See, Caesar!	shakespearean
He’ll find out soon what happened in England.	modern
Alack, I love myself.	shakespearean
So will you wish on me when the rash mood is on.	shakespearean
Cleopatra— Think you there was or might be such a man As this I dreamt of?	shakespearean
No, by our Lady, I don’t think he can.	modern
Rescue, my lord of Norfolk, rescue, rescue!	shakespearean
I’m telling you, your husband.	modern
I’ll set her on.	shakespearean
Get out, you dark-skinned gypsy!	modern
Here, at thy hand.	shakespearean
You slave, you cur!	shakespearean
Would I might never O’ertake pursued success, but I do feel, By the rebound of yours, a grief that smites My very heart at root.	shakespearean
Where got’st thou that goose look?	shakespearean
In any case, do what you want.	modern
All this is so, but what of this, my lord?	shakespearean
And to hell with drowning yourself!	modern
My life will be too short, And every measure fail me.	shakespearean
How have I offended?	shakespearean
What’s this all about?	modern
Clearly, men should not go out walking too late!	modern
What poor an instrument May do a noble deed!	shakespearean
I would your grace would constrain me to tell.	shakespearean
Robin Starveling, you’re going to play Thisbe’s mother.—Tom Snout, the handyman.	modern
How dost thou feel thyself now?	shakespearean
Welcome to the open air again.	modern
Yes, leave that labor to great Hercules—it’s worse than the previous twelve put together.	modern
I leave him to your gracious acceptance, whose trial shall better publish his commendation.” You hear the learned Bellario, what he writes.	shakespearean
Your speech is more refined than I would expect in such a remote place as this.	modern
Ay, past all surgery.	shakespearean
My husband will save me.	modern
Now by my life, Old fools are babes again and must be used With checks as flatteries, when they are seen abused.	shakespearean
Just as a town protected by a wall around it is worth more than a low-lying village, a married man’s horned forehead is more honorable than a bachelor’s bare forehead.	modern
Tell her you heard us, and that she should sneak into the arbor where the crisscrossing branches overhead keep the honeysuckles out of the sun.	modern
Hark you, Guildenstern, and you too—at each ear a hearer.	shakespearean
Is it true, sir, that the Duke of Cornwall was killed as they say?	modern
You see how the world goes, Volumnius.	modern
Let housewifery appear.	shakespearean
I have to go.	modern
Small joy have I in being England’s queen.	shakespearean
You were one of his favorites.	modern
It’s a messenger from the warships.	modern
Not tonight, good Iago.	shakespearean
He’s having a fit and talking nonsense.	modern
But, Lepidus, go to Caesar’s house.	modern
If it please His Majesty, ’tis the breathing time of day with me.	shakespearean
Where’s Publius?	modern
Dear God, please make him normal again!	modern
I will condole in some measure.—To the rest.—Yet my chief humor is for a tyrant.	shakespearean
Be at ease.	modern
Whilst he stood up and spoke, He was my master, and I wore my life To spend upon his haters.	shakespearean
And pay attention to what Caesar does and which men are close to him.	modern
Nobody was hurt in the slightest.	modern
Within this three mile may you see it coming; I say, a moving grove.	shakespearean
O you mighty gods,  This world I do renounce, and in your sights Shake patiently my great affliction off.	shakespearean
Just tell me what to do, and I’ll do it.	modern
Let’s carve him up like a dish fit for the gods, not chop him up like a carcass fit for dogs.	modern
What, you’re not a whore?	modern
Oh , stay but till then!	shakespearean
Flatterers?—Now, Brutus, thank yourself.	shakespearean
I will not have to do with you.	shakespearean
But soft, but soft a while.	shakespearean
Then we can let this ambitious tyrant continue unchallenged until each of us is killed at his whim.	modern
Be ruled.	shakespearean
But yet—   Which, of he or Adrian, for a good wager, first begins to crow?	shakespearean
I saw that.	modern
This box was tested in the fire seven times.	modern
Neither of them would take anything but the two rings.	modern
Yes, you’re right, her name is Margery.	modern
What a wretched and peevish fellow is this king of England to mope with his fat-brained followers so far out of his knowledge.	shakespearean
Lay off, already!	modern
Banquo and Donalbain, Malcolm!	modern
Tubal, a wealthy Jew I know, will supply me with the cash.	modern
Who is this fool?	modern
O Isis, ’tis impossible.	shakespearean
Tell him my fury will abate, and I’ll take the crowns.	modern
In the high and mighty Roman Empire, just before the emperor Julius Caesar was assassinated, corpses rose out of their graves and ran through the streets of Rome speaking gibberish.	modern
Everyone except the sailors dove into the sea, leaving behind the ship that I had set on fire.	modern
I’m sure Lorenzo isn’t on their ship.	modern
When I freed you from slavery, didn’t you swear to do this when I asked you?	modern
Go, go, dispatch.	shakespearean
Don’t tire yourself out, monsieur.	modern
Ye gods, it doth amaze me A man of such a feeble temper should So get the start of the majestic world And bear the palm alone.	shakespearean
I will not go today, and ere I do It shall be what o'clock I say it is.	shakespearean
Go seek him.	shakespearean
What did he say when he regained consciousness?	modern
One speech in it I chiefly loved.	shakespearean
He has some wonderful home furnishings—that’s what he calls them—that he’ll use to decorate his house when he gets one.	modern
Will you mock at an ancient tradition begun upon an honorable respect and worn as a memorable trophy of predeceased valor, and dare not avouch in your deeds any of your words?	shakespearean
That was no show.	modern
If you survive, I’ll live.	modern
Since the youth will not be entreated, his own peril on his forwardness.	shakespearean
It fell on a little western flower, which used to be white as milk but now has turned purple from being wounded by the arrow of love.	modern
Look to the queen there, ho!	shakespearean
I’ll never care what wickedness I do, If this man come to good.	shakespearean
Good Ursula, wake my cousin Beatrice and desire her to rise.	shakespearean
We can’t wait here.	modern
Oh, that’s very nice!	modern
And his voice is the paramour of sweetness.	modern
It’s something, it’s nothing: it’s yours, it’s mine, and it’ll belong to thousands more.	modern
There are parents living whose children you have butchered; they are now old withered plants who will moan over their losses as they grow old.	modern
Will you come with me to hear this news, sir?	modern
Of what kind should this cock come of?	shakespearean
The man in the moon!	modern
Love news, in faith?	shakespearean
Husband, let’s follow to see the end of this ado.	shakespearean
Please stop turning me around.	modern
That’s old news.	modern
Oh, Caesar, This Charmian lived but now.	shakespearean
It’s true.	modern
There’s a man haunting this forest who abuses the trees by carving “Rosalind” on their barks.	modern
Ere the bat hath flown His cloistered flight, ere to black Hecate’s summons The shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums Hath rung night’s yawning peal, there shall be done A deed of dreadful note.	shakespearean
I shall serve you, sir, Truly, however else.	shakespearean
With all my heart, and it doth much content me To hear him so inclined.	shakespearean
My brother never Did urge me in his act.	shakespearean
Therefore, my lords, omit no happy hour That may give furth'rance to our expedition; For we have now no thought in us but France, Save those to God, that run before our business.	shakespearean
I do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot, Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove.	shakespearean
Thank you, and God bless you for your hospitality.	modern
I do know him by his gait.	shakespearean
What says my lord?	shakespearean
Or have we eaten on the insane root That takes the reason prisoner?	shakespearean
Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in thy news?	shakespearean
I’ll either fight you, Macbeth, or else I’ll put down my sword unused.	modern
Okay, to the point.	modern
I will do this, if you can bring it to any opportunity.	shakespearean
I would not see ’t.	shakespearean
Then he’s the whining schoolboy, with a book bag and a bright, young face, creeping like a snail unwillingly to school.	modern
It signs well, does it not?	shakespearean
Why then, God’s soldier be he!	shakespearean
I swear by my sword, which killed the Shah of Persia and a Persian prince and defeated the Sultan Suleiman three times, that I would face the meanest-looking warriors on earth.	modern
My resolution and my hands I’ll trust, None about Caesar.	shakespearean
And my king goes on: if your royal father does not sweeten the bitter insult you sent my king and grant all our demands, Henry’s artillery will give you so resounding an answer that the very caves and vaulted cathedrals of France shall echo your mocking of him back in your face.	modern
Marry them to your heirs!	shakespearean
It is a man’s office, but not yours.	shakespearean
What is your will?	shakespearean
This was sometime a paradox, but now the time gives it proof.	shakespearean
I shall be pinched to death.	shakespearean
Tell me, if your art Can tell so much: shall Banquo’s issue ever Reign in this kingdom?	shakespearean
That eyeless head of thine was first framed flesh To raise my fortunes.	shakespearean
My deep trust in him made him deeply untrustworthy, arousing in him a treachery as big as my trust was—my trust which had no limit, an infinite confidence.	modern
A gallant curtal-axe upon my thigh, A boar-spear in my hand, and in my heart Lie there what hidden woman’s fear there will, We’ll have a swashing and a martial outside— As many other mannish cowards have That do outface it with their semblances.	shakespearean
Close, soft eyes.	modern
Let Caesar do whatever he wants.	modern
We have not yet set down this day of triumph.	shakespearean
I know the good king and queen have sent for you.	shakespearean
Nay, but the devil take mocking.	shakespearean
I suspect that I have committed some offence to the city and you have come to reprimand me for not knowing better.	modern
It’s not in the contract.	modern
I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes.	shakespearean
Talkers are no good doers.	shakespearean
And so falls it out With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey; and so ’twill do With some men else that think themselves as safe As thou and I, who, as thou know’st, are dear To princely Richard and to Buckingham.	shakespearean
I make not, but foresee.	shakespearean
There, take my coxcomb.	shakespearean
Now I’ve paid you back, Parthia, and gotten revenge for Marcus Crassus’ death.	modern
Haste me to know ’t, that I, with wings as swift As meditation or the thoughts of love, May sweep to my revenge.	shakespearean
Is the visor of my helmet working better now?	modern
I curse her.	modern
That’s better than exaggerating our trust.	modern
Let me wrap up your head, and it will feel okay in less than an hour.	modern
Are you backing away in fear?	modern
Thou 'rt mad to say it.	shakespearean
Pray, write down, “Borachio.”—Yours, sirrah?	shakespearean
Are there no stones in heaven But what serve for the thunder?—Precious villain!	shakespearean
If I should say, I saw such islanders— For, certes, these are people of the island— Who, though they are of monstrous shape, yet note, Their manners are more gentle-kind than of Our human generation you shall find Many—nay, almost any.	shakespearean
Cambio is transformed into Lucentio.	modern
I thank you all for your trouble and courtesy.	modern
Pray you, if it be, give it me, for I am slow of study.	shakespearean
Then run away.	modern
Ay, Desdemona.	shakespearean
Their aunt I am in law, in love their mother.	shakespearean
Signior Tranio, you also took aim at that bird, though you didn’t hit her.—So here’s a health to all who’ve shot and missed.	modern
I am hitherto your daughter.	shakespearean
Lechery, sir, it provokes and unprovokes.	shakespearean
Lady, will you walk a bout with your friend?	shakespearean
Get yourself to a convent, fast.	modern
I wanted to teach her how perfectly I love her, kinsman, and that’s good English.	modern
There’s none else by.	shakespearean
We shall, my lord, Perform what you command us.	shakespearean
He builds our fires, gets our firewood, and does all kinds of useful things for us.—Hey!	modern
I swear by this hand and my father’s soul, the whole thing is a disaster.	modern
I’ve destroyed my reputation, a most shameful error.	modern
Peace, ho!	shakespearean
Fresh beauty attracts thugs and thieves even more than money.	modern
Then why did you travel so quietly?	modern
What I can do I will, and more I will Than for myself I dare.	shakespearean
By God, I am not selfish when it comes to money: I don’t care who eats at my expense.	modern
And since the quarrel Will bear no color for the thing he is, Fashion it thus: that what he is, augmented, Would run to these and these extremities.	shakespearean
My love, my life, my soul, beautiful Helena!	modern
Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her, Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her, That true hearts cannot bear it.	shakespearean
You once stole my position; now you get to have the grief that goes with it.	modern
They’re like stomachs and we’re just the food.	modern
who can control his fate?	modern
I knew what you would prove.	shakespearean
Oh, don’t ask me why I “need” them!	modern
Will our army cut a swath through the fighting force of France, achieving and accomplishing everything I’ve assembled them to do?	modern
Where are these hearts?	shakespearean
Rulers abuse their power when they separate it from compassion.	modern
You have her father’s love, Demetrius.	shakespearean
John Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Earl of Surrey, Shall have the leading of this foot and horse.	shakespearean
Why do you infect yourself with them?	shakespearean
I forgot about the reward.	modern
A gentle scroll.	shakespearean
I might do ’t as well i' th' dark.	shakespearean
You said she slept with Cassio.	modern
Twice then the trumpets sounded, And there I left him tranced.	shakespearean
God, I’m really sick.	modern
If thy speech be sooth, I care not if thou dost for me as much.	shakespearean
They were lusting after each other.	modern
Tis she must do ’t, And, lo, the happiness!	shakespearean
O, let me kiss that hand!	shakespearean
Only describing what you have ruined.	modern
And what is that music?	modern
To feed were best at home; From thence, the sauce to meat is ceremony; Meeting were bare without it.	shakespearean
I’m sorry you’re leaving my father like this.	modern
Last night, when that star to the west of the North Star had traveled across the night sky to that point where it’s shining now, at one o'clock, Marcellus and I— Quiet, shut up!	modern
No, rather I will go to Benedick And counsel him to fight against his passion; And truly I’ll devise some honest slanders To stain my cousin with.	shakespearean
By my life I do, which I tender dearly, though I say I am a magician.	shakespearean
What, a prisoner?	shakespearean
No way, then, I’ll run.	modern
Make me believe it?	modern
I prithee, recount some of them.	shakespearean
Then I beat my tabor, At which, like unbacked colts, they pricked their ears, Advanced their eyelids, lifted up their noses As they smelt music.	shakespearean
Everyone knows that when you pour a drink out of a cup and into a glass, the cup becomes empty.	modern
I pray you, leave me.	shakespearean
Is he still alive, good uncle?	modern
You saw my master wink and laugh upon you?	shakespearean
I’ll end my exhortation after dinner.	shakespearean
I will have my bond.	shakespearean
He loves Caesar best, but he also loves Antony.	modern
Ay, my lord.	shakespearean
What shall become of this?	shakespearean
O God!	shakespearean
Go, prepare for dinner.	shakespearean
Why, he won’t wake up till Judgment Day.	modern
Say from whence You owe this strange intelligence, or why Upon this blasted heath you stop our way With such prophetic greeting.	shakespearean
I never knew woman love man so.	shakespearean
Hark, what noise is this?	shakespearean
Come, blade, drench my breast with blood.	modern
All ladies love me, except you.	modern
Deny to speak with me?	shakespearean
Oh ho, is that what you’re getting at?	modern
Please lie down and rest a while, my lord.	modern
But I, who have never known how to beg and never had to beg, am starved for food, dizzy with lack of sleep, kept awake with curses and fed with brawling.	modern
But I am much to blame.	shakespearean
Tis a hooded valor, and when it appears, it will bate.	shakespearean
If you want to go to hell, there are better ways to do it than killing yourself.	modern
Only three so far?	modern
Nay, blush not, Cleopatra.	shakespearean
My father-in-law lives closer to the marketplace.	modern
Commend me to my kind lord.	shakespearean
Myself have to mine own turned enemy.	shakespearean
Each of you, give me your bloody hand.	modern
What is amiss?	shakespearean
Why, so didst thou.	shakespearean
Any bar, any cross, any impediment will be med'cinable to me.	shakespearean
How smooth and cool they seem!	modern
As for me, I’m surrendering all my power over to him, giving him absolute authority for the rest of his life.	modern
And now I’ll do it.	modern
Fake, I’m telling you.	modern
Oh, you and I have heard our fathers say, There was a Brutus once that would have brooked Th' eternal devil to keep his state in Rome As easily as a king.	shakespearean
I am not gamesome.	shakespearean
But, sirrah, not for my sake, but your master’s, I advise You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies.	shakespearean
And you will be, or some people here will suffer for it.	modern
If we let crimes like this happen, slaves and heathens will be our rulers.	modern
Is ’t lost?	shakespearean
Aroint thee, witch!” the rump-fed runnion cries.	shakespearean
And earth!	modern
My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.	shakespearean
And yet to win her, all the world to nothing!	shakespearean
I’ll have my head cut from my shoulders before I’ll see the crown so misplaced.	modern
I wish my father could see them with my eyes.	modern
We’ll leave, Brutus.	modern
Come, I’ll show you your bridal chamber.	modern
No thank you, my lord.	modern
The wiser, the waywarder.	shakespearean
I’ll get there first and tell him what we found out.	modern
I know she is a hateful, brawling scold.	modern
But thou wouldst not think how ill all’s here about my heart.	shakespearean
Oh, treble woe Fall ten times treble on that cursèd head, Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense Deprived thee of!	shakespearean
What can we do to find out if it’s true?	modern
Is it so nominated in the bond?	shakespearean
Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table.	shakespearean
What kind of help?	shakespearean
Hero thinks surely she will die, for she says she will die if he love her not, and she will die ere she make her love known, and she will die if he woo her rather than she will bate one breath of her accustomed crossness.	shakespearean
Why, sir, cobble you.	shakespearean
I will proclaim my name about the field.	shakespearean
You’re a cobbler, are you?	modern
As for your husband, he is noble, wise, and judicious, and he understands what the times require.	modern
Wherefore to Dover?	shakespearean
Wilt thou rest damned?	shakespearean
I’m not sure, but I don’t think so.	modern
O my poor Rosalind, whither wilt thou go?	shakespearean
Let it fly out.	modern
I’ve set dangerous plans in motion, using lies, drunken prophecies, and stories about dreams to set my brother Clarence and the king against each other.	modern
Of all the days i' the year, I came to ’t that day that our last King Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.	shakespearean
When shall he come?	shakespearean
I hope you’re strong enough to do it.	modern
If they deny to come, Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands.	shakespearean
But back to that argument you mentioned.	modern
Oh, you stupid Moor!	modern
How is my lord?	modern
Well, let’s move on to our work with the living.	modern
I am given, sir, secretly to understand that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition to come in disguised against me to try a fall.	shakespearean
Medicine is for the dogs.	modern
The English are embattled, you French peers.	shakespearean
Is not this man jealous?	shakespearean
But Edward is still alive.	modern
Has this fellow no feeling of his business?	shakespearean
Of so high and plenteous wit and invention!	shakespearean
What is he that you ask for, niece?	shakespearean
Those that do die of it do seldom or never recover.	shakespearean
The weary way hath made you melancholy.	shakespearean
I insist, don’t be more distressed than I am.	modern
What means this shouting?	shakespearean
Look who comes here.	shakespearean
Alas, what is the matter?	shakespearean
You have seen nothing then?	shakespearean
O, let him pass.	shakespearean
I believe it won’t stop moving and stand upright till Richard wears the wreath of the realm.	modern
I will not live to hear the news from England.	modern
Do not say so, my lord.	shakespearean
The hell with order!	modern
Fall to.	shakespearean
If thou didst ever thy dear father love— O God!	shakespearean
That’s really the best way to win the Moor back again.	modern
You’ll soon be meeting Lorenzo at supper; he’ll be a guest of your new master.	modern
And there were a hundred spooked women huddled together in fear who swore they saw men on fire walk up and down the streets.	modern
But this would be too cold a place to sleep if he hadn’t warmed himself with ale.	modern
I should sin To think but nobly of my grandmother.	shakespearean
Please just name a time, but don’t wait more than three days.	modern
You agree now that we’re not imagining this, don’t you?	modern
I’ll fight every one of these devils if I have to, one at a time.	modern
She says you have some goodly jest in hand.	shakespearean
I’ll trust my determination and my hands, but none of Caesar’s men.	modern
Then must the Jew be merciful.	shakespearean
Forgotten you!	modern
I’m a gentleman, sir, and my name is Conrade.	modern
God bless your Worship!	modern
Was the crown offered him thrice?	shakespearean
Not all the dukes of waterish Burgundy Can buy this unprized precious maid of me.— Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind.	shakespearean
Hopefully when I get married, I’ll give my husband half my love and half my sense of duty.	modern
Go find out the news.	modern
Then I’ll know exactly what she is, just as I know what I am.	modern
All right, we’ll see you at dinnertime.	modern
To make society The sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself Till suppertime alone.	shakespearean
He knows no more about the proper practice of war, see—the ancient practices—than a puppy.	modern
Tell me.	modern
Here’s an empty seat, sir.	modern
Let us go sit here upon the church bench till two, and then all to bed.	shakespearean
Mere prattle without practice Is all his soldiership.	shakespearean
My sickness grows upon me.	shakespearean
As he was fortunate, I rejoice at it.	shakespearean
Perforce I must confess I thought you lord of more true gentleness.	shakespearean
Save that kind of harsh language for your worst enemy.	modern
He who is dizzy thinks the world is spinning”—please, tell me what you meant by that.	modern
What a king Claudius is!	modern
The other voice is harsh and abusive.	modern
Search every acre in the high-grown field, And bring him to our eye.	shakespearean
Laertes, I want you to hear what they say.	modern
O excellent device— and make a sop of him.	shakespearean
These Moors are changeable in their wills—fill thy purse with money.	shakespearean
Mountains don’t tremble, however much the wind may blow!	modern
Yes, sir.	modern
O, my lord, You said that idle weeds are fast in growth.	shakespearean
And this, Metellus Cimber.	shakespearean
To who, my lord?—Who hath the office?	shakespearean
Therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues.	shakespearean
Sir, I’m puzzled by what you just said.	modern
May I know?	shakespearean
You’ve got something for me?	modern
Send for him, good uncle.	shakespearean
The hell with her!	modern
Edmund I think is gone In pity of his misery to dispatch His nighted life; moreover to descry The strength o' th' enemy.	shakespearean
What is ’t you seek?	shakespearean
Old I do wax, and from my weary limbs Honor is cudgeled.	shakespearean
I loved you ever.	shakespearean
Tranio hits you now.	shakespearean
Let not my worser spirit tempt me again To die before you please.	shakespearean
Fore heaven, they have given me a rouse already.	shakespearean
He hasn’t arrived yet.	modern
Come, put mine armor on.	shakespearean
I have no idea what you’re talking about, Hamlet.	modern
Not so, my lord.	shakespearean
Why, true, he means to make a puppet of thee.	shakespearean
She haunts me in every place.	shakespearean
But taste my story, and relish it by paying attention.	modern
Caesar, all hail!	shakespearean
Do you love me?	modern
If we welcome our punishment, we punish it right back by seeming to take it lightly.	modern
Let him approach.	shakespearean
He was dressed like a hunter.	modern
This is to feel the news, not hear it.	modern
This only is the witchcraft I have used.	shakespearean
I cannot blame thee now to weep, For such an injury would vex a very saint, Much more a shrew of thy impatient humor.	shakespearean
What was th' impediment that broke this off?	shakespearean
Then the two of them will both pursue one girl.	modern
Do you know whom you’re talking to?	modern
But why did you tempt the heavens like that?	modern
I can’t run away.	modern
An you will not be answered with reason, I must die.	shakespearean
Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from this Jew, my master.	shakespearean
Come, my fair Cordelia.	shakespearean
But even if I thought you were right, it doesn’t matter.	modern
Half of your wealth goes to Antonio.	modern
Yes, it truly is.	modern
But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?	shakespearean
My husband will never get a moment’s rest, I’ll keep him up at night talking about you until he runs out	modern
Let’s to billiards.	shakespearean
I’ll test it out.	modern
He got what he deserved.	modern
Take hence this jack and whip him.	shakespearean
They are in the very wrath of love, and they will together.	shakespearean
Master Fer.	shakespearean
Take your cues from my own despair.	modern
Please go away, both of you.	modern
How beautiful the moonlight’s shining on this bank!	modern
Oh, Brutus!	modern
I stand for judgment.	shakespearean
You know where I’ll be waiting.	modern
I have the best armor in the world.	modern
No, not an oath.	shakespearean
Don’t greet your bride in these disgraceful clothes.	modern
Methought the billows spoke and told me of it, The winds did sing it to me, and the thunder, That deep and dreadful organ pipe, pronounced The name of Prosper.	shakespearean
How now, my lord!	shakespearean
All right, then.	modern
Many men have sold their souls Just to view my shiny surface.	modern
Tom’s chilly.	modern
I sneeze on your manhood.	modern
Signior Leonato, let the friar advise you.	shakespearean
But one word more— He will not be commanded.	shakespearean
Work, work your thoughts, and therein see a siege.	shakespearean
It’s impossible.	modern
You are welcome.	shakespearean
Say that I hope he never has cause to look for a new master.	modern
And so she turns men inside out and never acknowledges the integrity and merit that a man has.	modern
At least two glasses.	shakespearean
Throw my heart Against the flint and hardness of my fault, Which, being dried with grief, will break to powder And finish all foul thoughts.	shakespearean
These corpses suggest mayhem.	modern
Good-bye then, until the time I see you dressed in your battle gear, which will suit you both very well.	modern
I know how  Too light for a lout like you to catch—though no lighter than I should be.	modern
Hence, horrible shadow!	shakespearean
As long as you aren’t ashamed to show it, he won’t be ashamed to tell you what it means.	modern
Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you, though I know to divide him inventorially would dizzy th' arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw neither, in respect of his quick sail.	shakespearean
Some haste, my lord!	shakespearean
Don’t speak any further.	modern
Let her have your voice.	shakespearean
If that’s true, he won’t get it back by crying.	modern
Send him on his way quickly.	modern
She has robbed me of my sword.	shakespearean
Did I not, fellow?	shakespearean
Please let her speak.	modern
And that would be—?	modern
Now the inconstant moon has nothing to do with me.	modern
How, how, Cordelia?	shakespearean
I will presently go learn their day of marriage.	shakespearean
Did Michael Cassio, when you wooed my lady, Know of your love?	shakespearean
This is some monster of the isle with four legs who hath got, as I take it, an ague.	shakespearean
Or I will live Or bathe my dying honor in the blood Shall make it live again.	shakespearean
My father—I think I see my father.	modern
Young though I am, I’ve been observing these three blowhards closely.	modern
A mighty man of Pisa.	shakespearean
Why are you so rude to someone who loves you so much?	modern
What should I do I do not?	shakespearean
It would be wrong for me to think poorly of my grandmother.	modern
So everyone goes off into the world except me, who stays in because I’m sunburned.	modern
Good, speak to th' mariners.	shakespearean
On the condition that your sister’s son, Publius, also must die, Mark Antony.	modern
We came hither to fight with you.	shakespearean
Isn’t this Stephano, my drunken butler?	modern
He may recover yet.	modern
Round, even to faultiness.	shakespearean
What’s the difference?	modern
Sailors, sir.	modern
We already knew that.	modern
Did you fall?	modern
Gifts that God gives.	shakespearean
It’s as common for us old people to assume we know more than we do as for young people to be too wild and crazy.	modern
No, don’t even mention him.	modern
If thou speak’st false, Upon the next tree shall thou hang alive Till famine cling thee.	shakespearean
Woe, woe are we, sir, you may not live to wear All your true followers out.	shakespearean
Apparently so.—Cover their faces.	modern
Instead, she puts flowers in the boy’s hair and makes a fuss over him.	modern
I thank it, poor fool, it keeps on the windy side of care.	shakespearean
Oh God, Iago, what can I do to win my husband back again?	modern
I hope he’s not anywhere so disreputable that thugs like you can find him.	modern
The man is innocent.	shakespearean
I’ll get myself a fur-trimmed suit.	modern
Go, bring him here, boy.	modern
Please let me go.	modern
Don’t let her say I kept you.	modern
Not so hot.	shakespearean
I am much bound to you.	shakespearean
The letters that he speaks of  May be my friends.	shakespearean
Tis meet I should be used so, very meet.	shakespearean
You know from my clothing who I am.	modern
But well.	shakespearean
It is Brabantio.	shakespearean
Thankfully, we have reason to cool our raging lusts.	modern
Nor I, my lord.	shakespearean
Or if thou hast not broke from company Abruptly, as my passion now makes me, Thou hast not loved.	shakespearean
Oh, farewell!	shakespearean
It is well done and fitting for a princess Descended of so many royal kings.	shakespearean
I warrant it is to knight you, Captain.	shakespearean
For instance, our husbands	modern
He was like a schoolboy who finds a bird’s nest and happily shows it to his friend, who then steals it from him.	modern
Who do you think you are coming in here armed?	modern
The boy was going to support me in my old age!	modern
Friends, Romans, countrymen, give me your attention.	modern
He’s as smart as they come, but just a jester.	modern
Which of you trembles not that looks on me?	shakespearean
Silence awhile.—Robin, take off this head.— Titania, music call, and strike more dead Than common sleep of all these five the sense.	shakespearean
He is returned.	shakespearean
Sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if philosophy could find it out.	shakespearean
Whoa, man, you dare to support someone who’s been proclaimed a traitor?	modern
Alack, what trouble Was I then to you!	shakespearean
A pair of stocks, you rogue!	shakespearean
If love have touched you, naught remains but so:   Gramercies, lad, go forward.	shakespearean
Well then, leave them alone until they’re sober.	modern
The king enacts more wonders than a man, Daring an opposite to every danger.	shakespearean
How now, my noble friend?	shakespearean
The world esteemed thy father honorable, But I did find him still mine enemy.	shakespearean
I hope she keeps it short.	modern
We please them not by land.	shakespearean
And don’t be proud.	modern
You should know, my loving lord, I’ve heard that the marquess Dorset has fled to Brittany, to the earl of Richmond.	modern
Oh,  Master, master, look!	modern
You have to wait for the appropriate time to let loose.	modern
Though this island seem to be desert—	shakespearean
Your charm so strongly works 'em That if you now beheld them, your affections Would become tender.	shakespearean
You must call forth the watch that are their accusers.	shakespearean
Sue to him again and he’s yours.	shakespearean
I chose her for my wife when I thought I had no father to ask advice of.	modern
My royal kinsman, are you teaching our princess English?	modern
Let us hear what Antony can say.	shakespearean
And so, good-bye.	modern
I wish I could see this invisible drummer.	modern
Come here, monster, put some glue on your fingers, and carry away the rest of these clothes for us.	modern
Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.	shakespearean
Farewell, thou lob of spirits.	shakespearean
I will mourn Hero tonight.	modern
Either be patient and entreat me fair, Or with the clamorous report of war Thus will I drown your exclamations.	shakespearean
Iago, who began ’t?	shakespearean
Be calm, dear lady.	modern
The king’s a-bed.	shakespearean
My lord, the roinish clown, at whom so oft Your Grace was wont to laugh, is also missing.	shakespearean
She thanked me And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her, I should but teach him how to tell my story And that would woo her.	shakespearean
What are you talking about, man?	modern
And this same progeny of evils comes From our debate, from our dissension.	shakespearean
Nay, then you lie.	shakespearean
Tis a wild night.	shakespearean
A calendar, a calendar!	shakespearean
Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot, Myself to be a marv'lous proper man.	shakespearean
Hasn’t he proven himself to be a great villain—slandering, scorning, and dishonoring my cousin?	modern
I tell thee, man, ’tis better with me now Than when thou met’st me last where now we meet.	shakespearean
Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey.	shakespearean
This is his second fit.	shakespearean
Won’t the ladies be scared of the lion?	modern
God save you, sir.	shakespearean
Don’t miss our feast.	modern
Father, go ahead.	modern
This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet.	shakespearean
She didn’t ask anything?	modern
And how you may be converted I know not, but methinks you look with your eyes as other women do.	shakespearean
Then he says I didn’t return some ships he loaned me.	modern
We have to get out of here, old man.	modern
The king is full of grace and fair regard.	shakespearean
It is to be all made of fantasy, All made of passion and all made of wishes, All adoration, duty, and observance, All humbleness, all patience and impatience, All purity, all trial, all observance, And so am I for Phoebe.	shakespearean
My industrious servant, Ariel!	shakespearean
Well, I don’t.	modern
Tell me why, if you can.	modern
Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies.	shakespearean
How now, interjections?	shakespearean

Twas I that killed her.	shakespearean
Do you really mean that?	modern
Divine, perfect woman, give me a chance to prove in detail that I’m innocent of the evils you accuse me of.	modern

Lend me thy cloak, Sir Thomas.	shakespearean
Let him greet England with our sharp defiance.	shakespearean
Here and now I seem like Antony, but I can’t keep myself in this form, my boy.	modern
But I’ll linger.	modern
When was there ever before so great a loss on one side and so little on the other, in the ordinary and equal clash of battle?	modern

I hear a voice more piercing than the music of these trumpets calling “Caesar!” Speak.	modern
Oh, they say that dress surpasses all others.	modern
My lord, when I arrived at their home I gave them your letter.	modern
Your mistress is a good mount.	modern
Poor souls, they perished.	shakespearean
You must think this, look you, that the worm will do his kind.	shakespearean
But let it rest.—Now, Litio, to you.	shakespearean
I’ll wait on them with all respect and duty.	modern
My cousin’s a fool, and you are too.	modern
What an irreplaceable and grievous loss!	modern
Bear him away.	shakespearean
Tis true, this god did shake!	shakespearean
Tell them this, Publius.	modern
Prithee, be not angry.	shakespearean
My comfort is that old age, that poor preserver of beauty, can’t make my face any worse than it already is.	modern
I am sick and sullen.	shakespearean
Chill pick your teeth, zir.	shakespearean
In such a night To shut me out!	shakespearean
I’ll walk up and down and sing a song, so they’ll know I’m not afraid.	modern
I’m in a mood to beat you up pretty good.	modern
But he that filches from me my good name Robs me of that which not enriches him And makes me poor indeed.	shakespearean
Judge me the world if ’tis not gross in sense That thou hast practiced on her with foul charms, Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals That weakens motion.	shakespearean
Royal wench!	shakespearean

She can’t even imagine what “love” is.	modern
What do you think, will my friends prove loyal?	modern
That’s true.	modern
These fellows have some soul,	shakespearean
And I had to be away!	modern
Making your loss greater makes the person who caused it worse.	modern
It has leaked out that you’re hiding here.	modern
O nuncle, court holy water in a dry house is better than this rainwater out o' door.	shakespearean
Your Majesty says very true.	shakespearean
A damnèd death!	shakespearean
Good morrow to you.	shakespearean
But he sleeps.	shakespearean
He’s lying through his teeth!	modern
This night I’ll spend Unto a dismal and a fatal end.	shakespearean
Come the next sabbath, and I will content you.	shakespearean

The one is too like an image and says nothing, and the other too like my lady’s eldest son, evermore tattling.	shakespearean
Or docks, or mallows.	shakespearean
You’re going to lose this bet, my lord.	modern
My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, ’tis she That tempers him to this extremity.	shakespearean

Tell Antony Brutus is ta'en.	shakespearean
If the duke and his court agree to set aside the fine for one half of his property, I’m happy, as long as he lets me have the other half in trust, to give it to the gentleman who recently stole his daughter.	modern
I am glad that my weak words Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.	shakespearean
I choose her for myself.	shakespearean
Do you mean to say that the duke has abandoned the glamorous court to live as a monk?	modern
You can’t go any further with us, sir.	modern
But have you both forsworn me?	shakespearean

I might come back soon.	modern
Well, when Nature makes a person beautiful, can’t Fortune make her fall into a fire, thereby making her ugly after all?	modern
He speaks roughly, but what he says is smart, and his roughness makes other people enjoy listening to him.	modern
Now, if you occupy some place in the list of men that isn’t down at the very bottom, tell me.	modern
I was not myself, as a result of the wine.	modern
No more but e’en a woman, and commanded By such poor passion as the maid that milks And does the meanest chares.	shakespearean
I’ll rather kill myself.	shakespearean
Who, I?	shakespearean
I’ll bleed to death.	modern
Why are you doing this?	modern
If I know this, know all the world besides, That part of tyranny that I do bear I can shake off at pleasure.	shakespearean

Take thy face hence.	shakespearean
Just being thanked is more than enough for me, madam.	modern
Put out your torches.	modern
Enough of this frivolous talk.	modern
Now it’s time to get back to my studying, since I have a lot of serious business to take care of before dinner.	modern
But art thou not drowned, Stephano?	shakespearean
Or if you follow me, you’d better understand that I’ll do something bad to you in the forest.	modern
But that would ruin his reputation!	modern
Naughty lady, These hairs which thou dost ravish from my chin Will quicken and accuse thee.	shakespearean

This is the very painting of your fear.	shakespearean
Besides, Antonio certified the Duke They were not with Bassanio in his ship.	shakespearean
I love him even when he’s harsh and mean—Help me unpin this, would you?—I love even his stubbornness, his frowns, his bad moods.	modern
Tis his own blame.	shakespearean
Bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse.	shakespearean
When I work it over with magic spells, the drop will produce magical spirits that will trick Macbeth with illusions.	modern
We can be happy that things have been resolved so agreeably.	modern
Here is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder.	shakespearean
Let’s leave him.	modern
I did never know so full a voice issue from so empty a heart.	shakespearean
Six or seven thousand is their utmost power.	shakespearean
Now entertain conjecture of a time When creeping murmur and the poring dark Fills the wide vessel of the universe.	shakespearean
I’m going to ask her to let me talk to Desdemona.	modern
Kill men i' th' dark!	shakespearean
Treat me like you would treat a dog—kick me, hit me, neglect me, try to lose me.	modern
My songbird, we have beaten them to their beds.	modern
I saw the Duchess of Milan’s gown that they praise so.	shakespearean
I’ll court his favors.	shakespearean
Will you, I pray, demand that demi-devil Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body?	shakespearean
Let me just ask her one question, and by your authority as her father, order her to answer truthfully.	modern
By heaven, I saw my handkerchief in ’s hand.	shakespearean
Dost thou mock me?	shakespearean
It was yours, I swear.	modern
I suspect his friends will join us.	modern
Your Grace can do whatever he wants.	modern
We shall find of him A shrewd contriver.	shakespearean
I cannot be a man with wishing, therefore I will die a woman with grieving.	shakespearean
So get prepared.	modern
To me it is a prison.	shakespearean
No more with me.	shakespearean
Well then, God forgive me!	modern
How does my bounteous sister?	shakespearean
Why are you making them work so hard?	modern
But where will we go?	modern
Will she go to bed now?	modern
Here comes better news.	modern
Your Dane, your German, and your swag-bellied Hollander—Drink, ho!—are nothing to your English.	shakespearean
I know he loves me well.	shakespearean
Just, just; and the men do sympathize with the mastiffs in robustious and rough coming on, leaving their wits with their wives.	shakespearean
Dost thou believe, Orlando, that the boy Can do all this that he hath promisèd?	shakespearean
Lurk out of sight.	modern
Peace, fool.	shakespearean
You forget yourself To hedge me in.	shakespearean
It’s like half your soul’s been ripped out.	modern
I am maimed for ever.	shakespearean
You’re appealing to a son who hates you.	modern
By my knavery (if I had it), then I were.	shakespearean
You suffered a loss like mine?	modern
And, Kate, when France is mine and I am yours, then France is yours and you are mine.	modern
As absolute a traitor as any in the whole entire world—or even France or England!	modern
A segregation of the Turkish fleet.	shakespearean
Marry, heaven forbid!	shakespearean
An inviting eye, and yet methinks right modest.	shakespearean
I will either get you out, lying if I have to, or stay in prison in your place.	modern
Should I strike it with my spear?	modern
My money’s almost run out.	modern
Quiet, children, quiet.	modern
And when she weeps, weeps every little flower, Lamenting some enforcèd chastity.	shakespearean
A very even way, but no such friend.	shakespearean
Merciful powers, Restrain in me the cursèd thoughts that nature Gives way to in repose.	shakespearean
Your betters, sir.	shakespearean
Yes, right away.	modern
Wait, look!	modern
So you’ll go to hell?	modern
In faith, he’s penitent, And yet his trespass, in our common reason (Save that, they say, the wars must make example Out of her best) is not, almost, a fault T' incur a private check.	shakespearean
I rejoice in his good fortune.	modern
I brought you here from Venice.	modern
And she’s fierce, even though she’s little.	modern
Even  What, were you all snarling before I arrived, ready to catch each other by the throat like dogs, but now that I’m here, you turn your hatred toward me?	modern
Get thee gone, but do it.	shakespearean
Feed him with apricoks and dewberries, With purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries.	shakespearean
Farewell, farewell.	shakespearean
Do you intend it?	shakespearean
Rapier and dagger.	shakespearean
It would be much appreciated.	modern
What if she’s pretty but stupid?	modern
Sweet bodements!	shakespearean
Is Brutus sick?	shakespearean
That tree could be called God’s tree, since it drops such wonderful fruit.	modern
For thy escape would teach me tyranny, To hang clogs on them.—I have done, my lord.	shakespearean
And if you’re not as attentive in serving him as you used to be, that’ll be good.	modern
Did your letters pierce the queen to any demonstration of grief?	shakespearean
Ay, and the time seems thirty unto me, Being all this time abandoned from your bed.	shakespearean
You think you can get rid of me that easily?	modern
He brought many captives home to Rome whose ransoms brought wealth to the city.	modern
I would thou hadst been son to some man else.	shakespearean
If it might please you to enforce no further The griefs between ye, to forget them quite Were to remember that the present need Speaks to atone you.	shakespearean
Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.	shakespearean
Upon record, my gracious lord.	shakespearean
And time is at his period.	shakespearean
The more you beat me, the more I’ll love you.	modern
Well, praise the Lord you’re ugly.	modern
No, but to the gate, and there will the devil meet me like an old cuckold with horns on his head, and say, “Get you to heaven, Beatrice, get you to heaven; here’s no place for you maids.” So deliver I up my apes and away to Saint Peter.	shakespearean
Our tongue is rough, coz, and my condition is not smooth, so that, having neither the voice nor the heart of flattery about me, I cannot so conjure up the spirit of love in her that he will appear in his true likeness.	shakespearean
What name, fair lady?	shakespearean
Whip me such honest knaves.	shakespearean
I do know, When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul Lends the tongue vows.	shakespearean
For once upon a raw and gusty day, The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores, Caesar said to me, “Darest thou, Cassius, now Leap in with me into this angry flood And swim to yonder point?” Upon the word, Accoutred as I was, I plungèd in And bade him follow.	shakespearean
You’d make a good fool.	modern
Good morning, brother Bedford.	modern
So do I ever  For had I cursed now, I had cursed myself.	shakespearean
I’ll stay, my lord.	modern
I know it is the sun that shines so bright.	shakespearean
But brother, I have some strange news for you.	modern
Tis now but four o'clock.	shakespearean
An if your wife be not a madwoman, And know how well I have deserved the ring, She would not hold out enemy forever For giving it to me.	shakespearean
She cheated on me, and she was a whore.	modern
For my brother, I think he holds you well, and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect your ensuing marriage—surely suit ill spent and labor ill bestowed.	shakespearean
What is ’t you do?	shakespearean
Is ’t come to this?	shakespearean
Goodbye, old friend.	modern
Yea, and the best person too.	shakespearean
The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary horses, against the which he has impawned, as I take it, six French rapiers and poniards with their assigns—as girdle, hangers, and so.	shakespearean
Therefore, good Emilia, Give me my nightly wearing, and adieu.	shakespearean
Thou didst promise To bate me a full year.	shakespearean
She had a song of “Willow,” An old thing ’twas, but it expressed her fortune And she died singing it.	shakespearean
Twas this flesh begot Those pelican daughters.	shakespearean
Don’t get wound up, my good man.	modern
I have no personal reason to strike at him—only the best interest of the people.	modern
Ha, ha!	modern
Yes, indeed, bring them before me.	modern
And I.	shakespearean
Like the wind, I must have the freedom to blast anyone I please, as fools do.	modern
Why then, alas, Do I put up that womanly defense, To say I have done no harm?	shakespearean
Nice to see you.	modern
Do this suddenly, And let not search and inquisition quail To bring again these foolish runaways.	shakespearean
And now he’s gone.	modern
You have trained me like a peasant, obscuring and hiding from me all gentlemanlike qualities.	shakespearean
In fact, she’s crazed.	modern
Burn but his books.	shakespearean
Baptista is a noble gentleman, To whom my father is not all unknown, And were his daughter fairer than she is, She may more suitors have, and me for one.	shakespearean
Fellows, let’s be gone.	shakespearean
But that my Lady Beatrice should know me, and not know me!	shakespearean
No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp, And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee Where thrift may follow fawning.	shakespearean
Yes, unfortunately.	modern
And shall, or some of us will smart for it.	shakespearean
These English woes will make me smile in France.	shakespearean
Indeed, honor is what I want to talk to you about.	modern
It’s a common  What?	modern
Where have  Come here, boy.	modern
And when was he wont to wash his face?	shakespearean
He’ll recover his sanity there.	modern
You’ve described a warm friend who’s cooling off.	modern
That young swain that you saw here but erewhile, That little cares for buying anything.	shakespearean
I partly know the man.	shakespearean
Though Nature hath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath not Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?	shakespearean
Take the hint Which my despair proclaims.	shakespearean
Well, I will forget the condition of my estate to rejoice in yours.	shakespearean
I understand a fury in your words, But not the words.	shakespearean
Tom’s a- cold.	shakespearean
When we love our job we get up early and go to it joyfully.	modern
Remain calm until midnight, and then you’ll see what the trouble is.	modern
How did you know what happened to your poor father?	modern
You’ll work for me.	modern
From then on we’ll turn our backs on Athens.	modern
There goes a strong fellow, Menas.	modern
Finally the new moon, curved like a silver bow in the sky, will look down on our wedding celebration.	modern
Do promise, Kate, that you’ll do your French part to bring forth such a boy; and for my English half, take the word of a king and a bachelor.	modern
Briefly, sir.	shakespearean
That’s all he asks for himself.	modern
I am constant to my purpose.	shakespearean
When you have to steal your own wives some day, I’ll wait for you just as long.	modern
How’s the day?	shakespearean
You come with letters against the king and take Vanity the puppet’s part against the royalty of her father.	shakespearean
I’m going to make you a rich man.	modern
But do you hear, sir, have you married my daughter without asking my goodwill?	shakespearean
Well then, the beef without the mustard.	modern
But I never spoke the whole time?	modern
What do you have to say for yourself?	modern
But it was also prophesied that the crown would not go to your descendants, and that my sons and grandsons would be kings instead.	modern
I charge you by the law, Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar, Proceed to judgment.	shakespearean
I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.	shakespearean
I’d never do such a bad thing, not for the whole world!	modern
All this so suddenly?—Edmund, what’s going on?	modern
And what’s the news, good cousin Lodovico?	shakespearean
And only in that safety died her brothers.	shakespearean
Sinful Macduff, they were killed because of you!	modern
Moreover that we much did long to see you, The need we have to use you did provoke Our hasty sending.	shakespearean
Why, what have you done, sweet Beatrice?	modern
I love thee not.	shakespearean
And doth affection breed it?	shakespearean
I do wander everywhere  Swifter than the moon’s sphere.	shakespearean
Leave you your power to draw, And I shall have no power to follow you.	shakespearean
then I hope I have a life of misery!	modern
Have them come in front of the master constable.	modern
What trumpet is that same?	shakespearean
To be good-looking is a matter of luck, but to read and write is a natural gift.	modern
Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay.	shakespearean
Leave out the water.	modern
From top to toe?	shakespearean
Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber.	shakespearean
Oh, immortal gods!	modern
It comes upon me.—Art thou any thing?	shakespearean
To express the like kindness, myself, that have been more kindly beholding to you than any, freely give unto you this young scholar	shakespearean
Thus I let you go And give you to the gods.	shakespearean
Well, it certainly wasn’t true for Richard!	modern
Is it honest in deed and word?	shakespearean
Ah, he is young, and his minority Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester, A man that loves not me nor none of you.	shakespearean
Who, me, my lord?	modern
Very ill, too.	shakespearean
When you free your children from the sword, your grandchildren will repay you in your old age.	modern
Why, Antony.	shakespearean
See how yon justice rails upon yon simple thief.	shakespearean
Let them come—I don’t care.	modern
Go bid the priests do present sacrifice And bring me their opinions of success.	shakespearean
Be patient, I’m telling you.	modern
Why did you laugh then, when I said “man delights not me”?	shakespearean
A night is but small breath and little pause To answer matters of this consequence.	shakespearean
Listen to many people, but talk to few.	modern
Towards Chertsey, noble lord?	shakespearean
Because you’re like the lowborn fellow who strikes the bell—you keep interrupting my thoughts.	modern
It is meat and drink to me to see a clown.	shakespearean
The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees Is left this vault to brag of.	shakespearean
Art rich?	shakespearean
Good morning, worthy Caesar.	modern
Hear me yet, good Shylock.	shakespearean
I care not for my spirits, if my legs were not weary.	shakespearean
Because we were unprepared for the king’s visit, we weren’t able to entertain him as well as we would have wanted to.	modern
When he is best he is a little worse than a man, and when he is worst he is little better than a beast.	shakespearean
How heavy weighs my lord!	shakespearean
I’ll be thy second.	shakespearean
But who’s with him?	modern
I’m not sorry, either.	modern
Our care and pity is so much upon you That we remain your friend.	shakespearean
He’s lying dead in a ditch, with twenty deep gashes in his head, any one of which would have been enough to kill him.	modern
But know that I have tonight wooed Margaret, the Lady Hero’s gentlewoman, by the name of Hero.	shakespearean
I sense you’re treating me like a child.	modern
So Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are in for it.	modern
I am alone the villain of the earth, And feel I am so most.	shakespearean
Oh, is that Kent?	modern
He did, from first to last.	shakespearean
What effects, my lord?	shakespearean
I was his daughter when you banished him.	modern
What are these faces?	shakespearean
I’m killing myself with this provocative speculation . . .	modern
Be of good cheer.	shakespearean
Do you have your answer yet?	modern
And when the mind is quickened, out of doubt, The organs, though defunct and dead before, Break up their drowsy grave and newly move, With casted slough and fresh legerity.	shakespearean
This world is almost six thousand years old, and in all this time not one man has ever actually died from love.	modern
Let’s then determine with the ancient of war On our proceedings.	shakespearean
I think I can discover him, if you please To get good guard and go along with me.	shakespearean
Here come the lovers, full of joy and mirth.— Joy, gentle friends!	shakespearean
So humbly take my leave.	shakespearean
Faith, the priest was good enough, for all the old gentleman’s saying.	shakespearean
I never gave him reason to be jealous.	modern
He looked to the side, and pay attention to what he saw then: under an oak tree—whose lower branches were mossy with age and top branches ancient and brittle—he saw a wretched beggar, with overgrown hair and beard, asleep on his back.	modern
Be the Jacks fair within, the Jills fair without, the carpets laid, and everything in order?	shakespearean
No, he doth but mistake the truth totally.	shakespearean
I know the king and queen sent for you.	modern
You keep cramming words into my ears that I don’t want to hear.	modern
And I do hope good days and long to see.	shakespearean
Come on, envelope, open up for me.	modern
His ships are maneuverable.	modern
Do you want to exchange fathers?	modern
Now, banished Kent, If thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemned, So may it come thy master, whom thou lovest, Shall find thee full of labors.	shakespearean
In the same figure like the king that’s dead.	shakespearean
His knights are getting out of control, and he himself reprimands us about every little detail.	modern
I don’t think so.	modern
All right, you’ve had your say, but we’ll let the forest judge whether or not you spoke wisely.	modern
Well, let it strike.	shakespearean
How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her own defense?	shakespearean
A poor unfortunate beggar.	shakespearean
My soul shall thine keep company to heaven.	shakespearean
I’ll set a bourn how far to be beloved.	shakespearean
Though this island may appear desolate—	modern
Lucius, awake.	shakespearean
That’s the curse of military service.	modern
Stoop, Romans, stoop, And let us bathe our hands in Caesar’s blood Up to the elbows, and besmear our swords.	shakespearean
Alas, poor shepherd, searching of thy wound, I have by hard adventure found mine own.	shakespearean
It was wild insanity to believe promises made by the mouth and not the heart.	modern
Excellent in fencing, I mean, sir.	modern
Fall to ’t yarely, or we run ourselves aground.	shakespearean
You’re in a bad mood?	modern
Thou hadst, and more, Miranda.	shakespearean
Is he not a most profane and liberal counselor?	shakespearean
While he was alive, I lived only to serve him and oppose his enemies.	modern
We’re two lions born on the same day in the same litter, and I’m the older and more terrible.	modern
How “wear the garland”?	shakespearean
I overlooked your request, but I did not deny it.	modern
I will go find him.	modern
There lies the duke asleep, and there the keys.	shakespearean
Thou strik’st not me, ’tis Caesar thou defeat’st.	shakespearean
I always loved you.	modern
Me too, I won’t, I swear to God.	modern
I don’t know.	modern
Casca, you are the first that rears your hand.	shakespearean
The world is a bad place, where you can’t speak what you know.	modern
If I’m going to sing along with you, I need to know what key you’re singing in.	modern
Bassanio, we’ll say goodbye for now, since you’ve found Antonio.	modern
My master’s mind.	shakespearean
Get me some poison, Iago, this night.	shakespearean
You have heard him swear downright he was.	shakespearean
I crave your highness’ pardon.	shakespearean
Nor will you not tell me who you are?	shakespearean
White-livered runagate, what doth he there?	shakespearean
Oh, uncle, it’s better to smile and flatter indoors where it’s dry than get soaked out here.	modern
Here comes my wife now.	modern
My being in Egypt, Caesar, what was ’t to you?	shakespearean
Now, Antony, our hopes are answerèd.	shakespearean
Lord, what though?	shakespearean
He that keeps nor crust nor crumb,  Weary of all, shall want some.	shakespearean
Yes, that’s all true—but what do you mean by it, my lord?	modern
There are more than enough willing women around.	modern
Nay, let them go, a couple of quiet ones.	shakespearean
Have you heard this, Cassio?	modern
Some wine, ho!	shakespearean
The next hailstone should hit Caesarion, until one by one all my children, and every one of my brave Egyptians, are killed by the dissolving of this pellet storm and lie unburied, covered by gnats and flies.	modern
I’m glad to see your highness.	modern
Every one that does so is a traitor and must be hanged.	shakespearean
Put out the light of the candle, and then put out the light of her heart.	modern
I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife With wealth enough, and young and beauteous, Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman.	shakespearean
Ambassadors from Harry King of England Do crave admittance to your Majesty.	shakespearean
I’ll have you whipped with wire and soaked in brine like a pickle, making your pain linger.	modern
Take him off to jail!	modern
I’d do anything to bring them back together, since I really care for Cassio.	modern
If you can, your reason?	shakespearean
God made him and therefore let him pass for a man.	shakespearean
A pox o' your bottle!	shakespearean
You have bested many things, well don’t try and best me.	modern
Let the gods judge me!	modern
Down, and swear.	shakespearean
Gentle cousin, let’s go thank him and encourage him.	modern
I might wake you up in a while to send you on an errand to my brother Cassius.	modern
And wilt thou have me?	shakespearean
Mine and my father’s death come not upon thee, Nor thine on me.	shakespearean
If I could make things better by lying, I’d deny it.	modern
Is your other mouth calling my name?	modern
But no more sights!—Where are these gentlemen?	shakespearean
Wait, sweet Beatrice.	modern
I remember a fight, but not why we were fighting.	modern
Now in respect it is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in respect it is not in the court, it is tedious.	shakespearean
I know it.	modern
Why, now I see there’s mettle in thee, and even from this instant to build on thee a better opinion than ever before.	shakespearean
Let tornadoes spew water until the steeples of our churches and the weathervanes are all drowned.	modern
This island contains everything beneficial to life.	modern
Filths savor but themselves.	shakespearean
Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears, That long time have been barren.	shakespearean
If we’d been able to put on our play, we would have had it made.	modern
But how long fairly shall her sweet life last?	shakespearean
If either of you were a prince’s son, and you were imprisoned as I am now, and two murderers like yourselves came to you—wouldn’t you beg for your life?	modern
I know not what to say.	shakespearean
Is there more work to do?	modern
Your honor is the reason you are leaving.	modern
Good Hermia, do not be so bitter with me.	shakespearean
Marry, sir, to bid my old master the Jew to sup tonight with my new master the Christian.	shakespearean
Nothing, my lord.	shakespearean
Within the next three days I want to hear you tell me that Cassio’s dead.	modern
Do you recognize this face?	modern
Bless thee from whirlwinds, star-blasting, and taking!	shakespearean
Wouldst thou betray me?	shakespearean
This stormy night will turn us all into fools and madmen.	modern
Thou ’dst never fear the net nor lime, The pitfall nor the gin.	shakespearean
Sunday is just around the corner.	modern
Your physical health matters more than your reputation.	modern
The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones and all, Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.	shakespearean
Ay, sir, I thank God.	shakespearean
I would rather listen to my dog bark at a crow than hear a man swear that he loves me.	modern
Talk makes him crazy.	modern
Listen, I hear them.	modern
Once more I come to ask you, King Harry, if you’re ready to negotiate your ransom before your certain defeat.	modern
Why, what’s the danger?	modern
Oh, ’tis treason!	shakespearean
Were I in England now, as once I was, and had but this fish painted, not a holiday fool there but would give a piece of silver.	shakespearean
Some of you go to Decius’s house and some to Casca’s.	modern
If any, speak—for him have I offended.	shakespearean
What’s going on?	modern
Then sing it.	modern
For the intent and purpose of the law Hath full relation to the penalty, Which here appeareth due upon the bond.	shakespearean
Go and tell them so.	shakespearean
The man is notwithstanding sufficient.	shakespearean
The king is not bound to answer the particular endings of his soldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of his servant, for they purpose not their death, when they purpose their services.	shakespearean
One minded like the weather, most unquietly.	shakespearean
In heaven.	modern
If our eyes had authority, here they might take two thieves kissing.	shakespearean
Listen to me, because I’m older than you, surely.	modern
This diamond is a present from him to your wife for her boundless hospitality.	modern
I’ll speak as sharp as a dagger to her, but I won’t use one on her.	modern
And out of doubt you do me now more wrong In making question of my uttermost Than if you had made waste of all I have.	shakespearean
Pass the order along.	modern
We defy augury.	shakespearean
The tempest in my mind Doth from my senses take all feeling else Save what beats there—filial ingratitude.	shakespearean
It sang about my crimes.	modern
I’ll tell thee, friend, I am almost mad myself.	shakespearean
Haply the seas and countries different With variable objects shall expel This something-settled matter in his heart, Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus From fashion of himself.	shakespearean
Where did you hear this?	modern
But how?	modern
Why do you look like a frightened goose?	modern
Is not that strange?	shakespearean
What a miserable and obstinate fellow this king of England is, to blunder with his fat-headed followers so far beyond his capacity.	modern
Niece, will you look to those things I told you of?	shakespearean
What, did you cheat on us before we deserved it?	modern
Good Volumnius, you know that we went to school together.	modern
I’ve decided on a plan that doesn’t require your assistance.	modern
I’ll kiss your hand, and with that I leave you.	modern
Clarence has arrived—lying, cowardly  I’m not surprised it scared you, my lord.	modern
Then shall I swear to Kate, and you to me, And may our oaths well kept and prosp'rous be.	shakespearean
You don’t know whether it was wisdom or fear that made him flee.	modern
Things growing are not ripe until their season.	shakespearean
Carry them away.	modern
No, I am promised forth.	shakespearean
Good morrow, neighbor Gremio.—God save you, gentlemen!	shakespearean
Why then I think Cassio’s an honest man.	shakespearean
Oh, life is full of surprises!	modern
But Lysander’s so attractive that he’s turned heaven into hell!	modern
Well, gentlemen, I am thus resolved: On Sunday next, you know My daughter Katherina is to be married.	shakespearean
Receive all the blessings of a happy father.	modern
If you deny them, all the land will rue it.	shakespearean
My brother’s love, the devil, and my rage.	shakespearean
He is of note.	shakespearean
I would cure you if you would but call me Rosalind and come every day to my cote and woo me.	shakespearean
Was the hope drunk Wherein you dressed yourself?	shakespearean
Keep this libertine occupied with endless debauchery.	modern
The king’s son, Ferdinand, With hair up-staring—then, like reeds, not hair— Was the first man that leaped, cried, “Hell is empty And all the devils are here.”      Why, that’s my spirit!	shakespearean
God be wi' you and keep you and heal your pate.	shakespearean
Cicero is dead, by their decree.	modern
Is there any way I could show such friendship to you?	modern
You can’t mean what you’re saying.	modern
Where learned you this, Fool?	shakespearean
Your answer to that?	shakespearean
Are you out of your mind and deaf too?	modern
To hell with your sword.	modern
Why, sir, a carpenter.	shakespearean
I would they’d fight i’ th’ fire or i’ th’ air, We’d fight there too.	shakespearean
Now go and get me some booze.	modern
Better Macbeth Than such an one to reign.	shakespearean
I called thee then “vain flourish of my fortune.” I called thee then poor shadow, “painted queen,” The presentation of but what I was, The flattering index of a direful pageant, One heaved a-high, to be hurled down below, A mother only mocked with two fair babes, A dream of what thou wast, a garish flag To be the aim of every dangerous shot, A sign of dignity, a breath, a bubble, A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.	shakespearean
Yes, my lord.	modern
Shall I let them exhibit me to the shouting mobs of Rome?	modern
Are you a man?	shakespearean
And when is he leaving?	modern
Are my master and his wife coming, Grumio?	modern
You’re as pale as your nightgown!	modern
My brave relative!	modern
I shall offend, either to detain or give it.	shakespearean
A veteran commander and a very kind gentleman.	modern
Isn’t this war against me?	modern
The man should be put into the lanthorn.	shakespearean
If Duncan bleeds I’ll paint the servants' faces with his blood.	modern
Go out and feel what the impoverished feel.	modern
What, is the man insane?	modern
But shall we wear these glories for a day, Or shall they last and we rejoice in them?	shakespearean
Bring thou the master to the citadel.	shakespearean
Take heed, Signior Baptista, lest you be cony-catched in this business.	shakespearean
Come on, come on.	modern
But as far as I can tell, people with too much suffer as much as people with nothing.	modern
The whole world could look at you, and no one would be as blind as he is, thinking you’re beautiful.	modern
Your master is a wise and honorable Roman.	modern
He is already named and gone to Scone To be invested.	shakespearean
The one who plays the part of the king will be particularly welcome.	modern
You speak like a very thankful and respectful boy, and may God bless you.	modern
Thou dost, and think’st it much to tread the ooze Of the salt deep, To run upon the sharp wind of the north, To do me business in the veins o' th' earth When it is baked with frost.	shakespearean
No more.	shakespearean
I don’t think he’d have any choice, my lord.	modern
The Moor is being tricked by some crook, some terrible villain, some rotten bastard.	modern
What was ’t That moved pale Cassius to conspire?	shakespearean
Demetrius loves her, and he doesn’t love you.	modern
He asks her to do what God  Say she will be a high and mighty queen.	modern
Of course, they won’t believe you without proof.	modern
Aren’t you Kent?	modern
I could do it myself.	modern
Are you considering desertion, as well?	modern
Shall I come down?	modern
Can a person be forgiven and still keep the fruits of his crime?	modern
Prithee, say on.	shakespearean
He loves them both.	modern
Sir, I say to you it is thought you are false knaves.	shakespearean
You men are rank beginners!	modern
If the matter were good, my lord, I durst swear it were his.	shakespearean
By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of this great world.	shakespearean
It wouldn’t hurt you to be charitable.	modern
I’d rather see you having fun, because we have friends coming who want to have fun.	modern
I’ve only been hurt, not killed.	modern
Please go back to Goneril’s house.	modern
Who deserted this morning?	modern
This was his basket.	shakespearean
Fury, Fury!—There, Tyrant, there.	shakespearean
Let’s stay and hear the will!	modern
I have a daughter, sir, called Katherina.	shakespearean
To make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl?	shakespearean
Yes, why not, my lord?	modern
He wouldn’t get drunk much, since there’s no wine here.	modern
Thou never shalt hear herald anymore.	shakespearean
How fearful And dizzy ’tis to cast one’s eyes so low!	shakespearean
First you taught me how to beg, and now I think you’re teaching me how a beggar should be answered.	modern
I assure you, sir, it’s true.	modern
Captain Fluellen.	shakespearean
Your case is better.	shakespearean
Let your epilogue alone.	shakespearean
We won’t, sir.	modern
My stupid heart, which I’m leaving behind here.	modern
Thus far has our straining author pursued the story with his crude, inadequate writing, keeping important people penned up in this little room while he mangled history’s full glory with his uneven telling.	modern
He’s honest, he’s got to speak the truth.	modern
If I could shoot lightning bolts from my eyes, I can tell you who’d be on the ground.	modern
Regan, is that what you said?	modern
Villain, you don’t know the laws of God or of man.	modern
Oh, you excellent young man!	modern
By heaven, I do not, I do not, gentlemen.—   O murderous coxcomb!	shakespearean
Here comes newer comfort.	shakespearean
Why, friends, you go to do you know not what.	shakespearean
And now who but you knows whether I’m yours?	modern
Take some memento from us as a token of our gratitude, not as a fee.	modern
What, must I come to you With five and twenty, Regan?	shakespearean
Come, sir, what letters had you late from France?	shakespearean
Now we speak upon our cue, and our voice is imperial.	shakespearean
But art thou not advised, he took some care To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?	shakespearean
Stay and tell me more.	modern
Oh, give us leave, great king, To view the field in safety and dispose Of their dead bodies.	shakespearean
I wish I were, so I could deprive you of both day and life.	modern
Boys, how are you both doing?	modern
But hast thou yet latched the Athenian’s eyes With the love juice, as I did bid thee do?	shakespearean
Yes, ma'am.	modern
Well, daughter, and you gentlewomen all, Withdraw into a chamber by yourselves, And when I send for you, come hither masked.	shakespearean
Drowning is for cats or blind puppies—don’t drown yourself!	modern
We must follow the leaders.	shakespearean
In such a night as this, When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees And they did make no noise, in such a night Troilus methinks mounted the Trojan walls And sighed his soul toward the Grecian tents Where Cressid lay that night.	shakespearean
If our father would sleep till I waked him, you should enjoy half his revenue forever, and live the beloved of your brother,       Edgar.”  Hum, conspiracy?	shakespearean
Now, most noble Brutus, the gods are friendly with us today so that we, who want peace, can live on to old age!	modern
The voice kept crying, “Sleep no more!” to everyone in the house.	modern
If I can’t do that, I can at least make the Moor so jealous that he can’t think straight.	modern
You’re mistaken.	modern
If this be so, why blame you me to love you?	shakespearean
Bring a corollary, Rather than want a spirit.	shakespearean
There’s going to be a storm.	modern
Send me away?	modern
I had as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger.	shakespearean
Come, this way to the rowboat.	modern
Where have you been, sister?	modern
What say you?	shakespearean
Being too old to marry someone young.	modern
God give him health.	modern
Strumpet, I come.	shakespearean
His eyes were as green as leeks.	modern
Juno and Ceres are whispering about something serious.	modern
If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you in that.	shakespearean
Or thorn-bushes.	modern
A pound of man’s flesh taken from a man Is not so estimable, profitable neither, As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats.	shakespearean
Good luck, worthy soldier, and good-bye.	modern
Tremblingly she stood And on the sudden dropped.	shakespearean
A pretty pathetic monster.	modern
Good riddance!—Close the curtains and leave.—I hope everyone who looks like him will make the same choice.	modern
Please, tell Benedick about her feelings and see what he has to say.	modern
We have consented to all reasonable terms.	modern
What, and stake down?	shakespearean
Eros, Wouldst thou be windowed in great Rome and see Thy master thus with pleached arms, bending down His corrigible neck, his face subdued To penetrative shame, whilst the wheeled seat Of fortunate Caesar, drawn before him, branded His baseness that ensued?	shakespearean
And he’s friendly with Caesar.	modern
I prithee, pretty York, who told thee this?	shakespearean
Get over it.	modern
I’m a soldier, more experienced than you, and better able to give orders.	modern
That was my turquoise ring!	modern
Who’s going to keep me from them?	modern
All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes, That I, being governed by the watery moon, May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world.	shakespearean
So we need another prologue to tell everyone he’s not a real lion.	modern
O, that once more you knew but what you are!	shakespearean
I don’t like the way he’s acting, and it’s not safe for me to let his insanity get out of control.	modern
I don’t know.	modern
No messenger but thine, and all alone Tonight we’ll wander through the streets and note The qualities of people.	shakespearean
Stop right there, sir.	modern
I’ll answer for everything.	modern
I beg your pardon, sirs.—Please tell me your name, sir?	modern
Peace, peace!	shakespearean
Good bawcock, 'bate thy rage.	shakespearean
He will do all in all as Hastings doth.	shakespearean
When I did make thee free, swor’st thou not then To do this when I bade thee?	shakespearean
A lord to a lord, a man to a man, stuffed with all honorable virtues.	shakespearean
Carry him gently to my fairest chamber And hang it round with all my wanton pictures.	shakespearean
So did you me, my liege.	shakespearean
Speak, speak!	shakespearean
If thou would have such a one, take me.	shakespearean
Son, I’ll stake you half that Bianca comes.	modern
They are incensed.	shakespearean
Therefore thou liest.	shakespearean
I met her deity Cutting the clouds towards Paphos, and her son Dove-drawn with her.	shakespearean
Alack the day, I know you not, young gentleman.	shakespearean
I will send for him, and question him yourself.	shakespearean
I tell you truly, in true English: I love you, Kate.	modern
Take it easy!	modern
Who stays it still withal?	shakespearean
Come on, Antonio.	modern
I will make myself known to Desdemona.	shakespearean
No, come back, Kate.	modern
Have you not hurt your head?	shakespearean
That Don John had given him a thousand pieces of gold for wrongfully accusing the Lady Hero.	modern
The sight whereof I think you had from me, From Claudio and the Prince.	shakespearean
Hark thee, Dardanius.	shakespearean
No, don’t be ashamed, Cleopatra.	modern
Most powerful lord, my mistress Cleopatra sent me to you.	modern
If I were Brutus now and Brutus were me, I wouldn’t have let him influence me.	modern
O madam, madam, madam!	shakespearean
Now, herald, have the dead been counted?	modern
I swear the only ransom will be these bones of mine.	modern
Go you with me, uncle of Exeter.	shakespearean
Therefore, do your duty and take your reward, because my master and mistress are nearly frozen to death.	modern
He’s late.	modern
Front to front Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself.	shakespearean
This castle is in a pleasant place.	modern
In the mud.	modern
Me too.	modern
Moors are moody people.—So sell your lands and raise a lot of cash.	modern
I cannot drink too much of Brutus' love.	shakespearean
Lock him in, so he can play the fool in his own home only.	modern
You wronged yourself to write on behalf of such a man.	modern
Under what captain serve you?	shakespearean
But let me hear the letter from your friend.	modern
I do hear the morning lark.	shakespearean
It makes me very happy to hear he’s so interested.	modern
O, in the battle think on Buckingham, And die in terror of thy guiltiness.	shakespearean
Yes, you’re speaking very well.	modern
She has betrayed me and shall die.	modern
Is it “chaste in word and action”?	modern
Who ambles time withal?	shakespearean
How does thy honor?	shakespearean
Look, here comes someone who loves me, along with someone who loves her.	modern
Yea, my lord, but I can cross it.	shakespearean
Oh, oh, oh, oh.	modern
Yes, very well.	modern
I’d rather kill myself.	modern
You can relax, ma'am.	modern
I go.	shakespearean
Fears and scruples shake us.	shakespearean
Shed thou no blood, nor cut thou less nor more But just a pound of flesh.	shakespearean
My dearest love, Duncan comes here tonight.	shakespearean
Do you mean the king?	modern
Let me hear from you.	shakespearean
Here’s another, stronger than the first.	modern
Killing swine.	shakespearean
They have fully sixty thousand fighting men.	modern
That way Antony will feel like he’s fighting his own men.	modern
In all these circumstances I’ll instruct you.	shakespearean
Our enemies have driven us to the edge of the grave.	modern
In faith, my hand meant nothing to my sword.	shakespearean
Hardly, Kate.	modern
Our hour  Is fully out.	shakespearean
Why, ’tis a cockle or a walnut shell, A knack, a toy, a trick, a baby’s cap.	shakespearean
How canst thou cross this marriage?	shakespearean
When he leaves, it’s very important that I talk to you.	modern
Will you say grace, sweet Kate, or shall I?—What is this?	modern
If she should make tender of her love, ’tis very possible he’ll scorn it, for the man, as you know all, hath a contemptible spirit.	shakespearean
Do you recognize my voice, noble lord?	modern
If any, speak—for him have I offended.	shakespearean
My lord, my lord!	shakespearean
Tomorrow or next day they will be here.	shakespearean
Now, gods, stand up for bastards!	shakespearean
No, you’re just taunting me.	modern
You say you are a better soldier.	shakespearean
I wish my horse moved as fast as your mouth and was as tireless.	modern
Has any man seen him at the barber’s?	modern
I’d deny whatever evidence you had against me—even if it were in my own handwriting—and turn it all into evidence against you and your plans for treachery.	modern
And what would that accomplish?	modern
They show their bloody heralds of battle, and something must be done immediately.	modern
Ah, my good old friends!	modern
I have as much of our father in me as you do, though I admit you’re closer to him and matter more because you’re older.	modern
Won’t he join us?	modern
I pray thee, if it stand with honesty, Buy thou the cottage, pasture, and the flock, And thou shalt have to pay for it of us.	shakespearean
Captain, I thee beseech to do me favors.	shakespearean
Can any of your neighbors tell, Kate?	shakespearean
Stanley, what news do you have?	modern
Well, it must have been Signior Benedick.	modern
Fare you well.	shakespearean
I’ll have glory in this losing day—more than Octavius and Mark Antony will gain by their foul conquest.	modern
Would you try to lift Mount Olympus?	modern
thee aloud “England is thine, Ireland is thine, France is thine, and Harry Plantagenet is thine,” who, though I speak it before his face, if he be not fellow with the best king, thou shalt find the best king of good fellows.	shakespearean
I pray you watch about Signior Leonato’s door, for the wedding being there tomorrow, there is a great coil tonight.	shakespearean
I’ll read it aloud.	modern
I shall deliver so.	shakespearean
Oh, lady, speak again.	modern
The jewels you have had from me to deliver Desdemona would half have corrupted a votaress.	shakespearean
Oh yes, sir, I have often been to Pisa—Pisa, City of Wise Men.	modern
And thane of Cawdor too: went it not so?	shakespearean
Damn you for teaching me your language!	modern
Speak to me home.	shakespearean
Yet I insisted; yet you answered not, But with an angry wafture of your hand Gave sign for me to leave you.	shakespearean
First, you have to speak to the watchmen who accused them.	modern
The nobles of Cyprus whom you invited to dinner are waiting for you.	modern
I’m Lorenzo, your love.	modern
And let us swear to our resolution.	modern
Be collected.	shakespearean
I heard him say, Brutus and Cassius Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome.	shakespearean
Where do I dwell?	shakespearean
There is something else.	shakespearean
No, indeed are they not.	shakespearean
It’s often the case that having something makes us spoiled, while not having it turns out to be advantageous.	modern
What news, my lord?	shakespearean
We had like to have had our two noses snapped off with two old men without teeth.	shakespearean
Tell me, how fares our loving mother?	shakespearean
That’s a Cornish name.	modern
Who’s this?	modern
If Cleopatra hears even a breath of this, she’ll die immediately.	modern
It’s entirely possible.	modern
Go in, Nerissa.	shakespearean
You a man?	shakespearean
And I for Rosalind.	shakespearean
They eat us up hungrily, and when they’re full, they vomit us up.	modern
They’re never jealous for a reason; they’re just jealous.	modern
You’re torturing me, Tubal.	modern
A victory in battle is twice as victorious when all the soldiers return home safely.	modern
The worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul.	shakespearean
You take the bill and I’ll take your yardstick.	modern
It should seem then that Dobbin’s tail grows backward.	shakespearean
My duty to you both, on equal love, Great kings of France and England.	shakespearean
I pray you, is my master yet returned?	shakespearean
Seven days and nights?	shakespearean
Who’s dead?	modern
Let’s go find that hussy, Fortune, and and mock her till she starts distributing her gifts more equally.	modern
If we lose this battle, this is the last time we’ll speak to each other.	modern
My lord of Burgundy.	shakespearean
Carriage” makes it sound like it’s pulling around a cannon.	modern
We know you have a job to do, Brakenbury, and we’ll do what you say.	modern
Well, if you were never at court, you were never exposed to good manners; if you never witnessed good manners, your manners must be wicked; wickedness is a sin, and committing sins leads to damnation.	modern
But for the stuffing—well, we are all mortal.	shakespearean
We shall be the more marketable.—Bonjour, Monsieur Le Beau.	shakespearean
I believe drink did all of this to you last night.	modern
It’s almost fairy time.	modern
Upon them!	shakespearean
I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round hose in France, his bonnet in Germany, and his behavior everywhere.	shakespearean
If I speak like myself in this, let him be whipped that first finds it so.	shakespearean
Downy windows, close,	shakespearean
What should this mean?	shakespearean
I am glad thou canst speak no better English, for if thou couldst, thou wouldst find me such a plain king that thou wouldst think I had sold my farm to buy my crown.	shakespearean
If I could win a lady by playing leapfrog or vaulting into my saddle with my armor on my back—though you may accuse me of boasting—I could easily get myself a wife.	modern
Does’t not go well?	shakespearean
I will my lord, as fast as I can.	modern
My dear lord, tell me what’s bothering you.	modern
She has a body, not a life.	modern
What say you to a neat’s foot?	shakespearean
Lord, how art thou changed!	shakespearean
O Bottom, thou art changed!	shakespearean
Let’s move.	modern
Whatever else happens tonight, I hope the king escapes safely!	modern
O Cassio, whence came this?	shakespearean
Let me finish my curse.	modern
I must attend the duke at dinner.	shakespearean
Come, bring me to them.	modern
You would lift the moon out of her sphere if she would continue in it five weeks without changing.	shakespearean
I had rather be any kind o' thing than a fool.	shakespearean
What’s important is to be prepared.	modern
Oh, madam, my old heart is broken, broken.	modern
Bids the winds blow the earth into the sea Or swell the curlèd water 'bove the main, That things might change or cease.	shakespearean
Why, sweet Othello—   I have not deserved this.	shakespearean
I tell you, you can use it to get your shoes fixed.	modern
Who calls?	shakespearean
Remember to see me today.	modern
He gives BIONDELLO  Here comes Baptista.	modern
I’m sure I’ll feel guilty if I run away from this Jew, my master.	modern
My daughter’s mother thinks it with her soul.	shakespearean
Go after her, go.	modern
Well, all right then.	modern
I am one, my liege, Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world Have so incensed that I am reckless what I do to spite the world.	shakespearean
Let go my hand.	shakespearean
Yes, and one other place, if you’ll only let me name it.	modern
You’re in your own kingdom, sir.	modern
Six or seven thousand, at most.	modern
I promise you I scarcely know myself.	shakespearean
That’s a nasty garter belt.	modern
That’s worse.	modern
She will have a seat—you heard my daughter tell you how.	modern
I would to God all strifes were well compounded.	shakespearean
What a crazy island this is.	modern
If the Jew cuts deep enough, I’ll pay it instantly with all my heart.	modern
Then the liars are fools, for there are enough liars in the world to beat up the honest men and hang them.	modern
I’m going to get my  Please, listen to me.	modern
With lawyers in the vacation, for they sleep between term and term, and then they perceive not how time moves.	shakespearean
Can virtue hide itself?	shakespearean
I’m very glad.	modern
The French is gone off, look you, and there is gallant and most prave passages.	shakespearean
Well, whose is it?	modern
Come on, tie them up.	modern
You got me, I admit it.	modern
To a nunnery, go.	shakespearean
We would so, and then go a-batfowling.	shakespearean
Would your highness like to take a walk?	modern
I took no more pains for those thanks than you took pains to thank me.” That’s as much as to say, “Any pains that I take for you is as easy as thanks.” If I do not take pity of her, I am a villain.	shakespearean
Have you seen my lord?	modern
Don’t insult me with your distrust.	modern
Oh, do-de, do-de, do-de.	shakespearean
If you meet the Prince in the night, you can order him to stop.	modern
I did—and now I’ve got it!	modern
Would thou and those thy scars had once prevailed To make me fight at land!	shakespearean
What, is the jay more precious than the lark Because his feathers are more beautiful?	shakespearean
For God knows how many healthy men will shed their blood in support of whatever you persuade me to do.	modern
Look, here she comes, with your ungovernable wives in tow, like prisoners of her womanly persuasion.—Katherine, that cap of yours doesn’t look good on you.	modern
Don’t spoil the justness and virtue of our endeavor nor weaken our own irrepressible spirits by thinking that we need a binding oath, when the blood that every noble Roman contains within him would be proven bastard’s blood if he broke the smallest part of any promise he had made.	modern
And thought they Margaret was Hero?	shakespearean
How are my old friends from this island doing?—Honey, they’ll love you here in Cyprus.	modern
I swear I thought you meant you’d been hurt physically.	modern
Being done unknown, I should have found it afterwards well done, But must condemn it now.	shakespearean
I remember he’s already occupied.	modern
Where lies he?	shakespearean
If I decide to get angry at you, just watch out— You’d be done for then, monster.	modern
I’m left with nothing to do in this weak, idle peacetime, unless I want to look at my lumpy shadow in the sun and sing about	modern
Behold and see.	shakespearean
Well, God bless this marriage!	modern
Oh, he’s a gallant king!	modern
Even those you were wont to take delight in, the tragedians of the city.	shakespearean
This murderous shaft that’s shot Hath not yet lighted, and our safest way Is to avoid the aim.	shakespearean
Go escort the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester.	modern
Or to be naked with her friend in bed An hour or more, not meaning any harm?	shakespearean
No, that’s not it, trust me.	modern
Oh, I followed that I blush to look upon!	shakespearean
With all my heart.—Some three or four of you Go give him courteous conduct to this place.— Meantime the court shall hear Bellario’s letter.	shakespearean
Find out moonshine, find out moonshine!	shakespearean
Bring down that top sail!	modern
Quick, quick!	shakespearean
They have their exits and their entrances, And one man in his time plays many parts, His acts being seven ages.	shakespearean
You’re brave gentlemen.	modern
Why, you speak like an experienced and quiet watchman.	modern
The sun doth gild our armor.	shakespearean
O, thou didst prophesy the time would come That I should wish for thee to help me curse That bottled spider, that foul bunch-backed toad!	shakespearean
This is a stranger business than men have ever set foot in before, and it’s not natural either.	modern
In the time since he left Egypt, he could have traveled an even longer distance.	modern
Let us go.	shakespearean
He attendeth here hard by To know your answer whether you’ll admit him.	shakespearean
He carries a third of the world.	modern
Tut, I have the best armor of the world.	shakespearean
Thank you.	modern
What, I, my lord?	shakespearean
But for your private satisfaction, Because I love you, I will let you know.	shakespearean
In that case I wish you were as good a man as a fish seller.	modern
he whom next thyself Of all the world I loved and to him put The manage of my state, as at that time Through all the signories it was the first, And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed In dignity, and for the liberal arts Without a parallel.	shakespearean
What time is it?	modern
Does a madman scare me when he stares at me?	modern
Poor lady, she’ll go crazy when she sees it’s missing.	modern
Nay, heaven doth know.	shakespearean
But why couldn’t I say “Amen”?	modern
It’s dangerous out there.	modern
Both of you are very welcome here.	modern
I have sent twenty out to seek for you.	shakespearean
I feel sorry for you.	modern
Her heart is carrying a heavy weight.	modern
But fear not yet To take upon you what is yours.	shakespearean
Listen but don’t speak to it.	modern
Shall I speak a word in your ear?	shakespearean
I have said.	shakespearean
We’ll feast each other ere we part, and let’s Draw lots who shall begin.	shakespearean
Anyone who has a house to cover his head has a good head on his shoulders.	modern
I do not like thy look, I promise thee.	shakespearean
Didst thou not hear a noise?	shakespearean
I swear on my life and honor, he’ll sit here in the stocks until noon.	modern
Sweet Prince, you learn me noble thankfulness.— There, Leonato, take her back again.	shakespearean
Fie on thee!	shakespearean
Why, ay.	shakespearean
That’s right, she did.	modern
Aren’t you dead yet?	modern
Tell me, rainbow, do you know if either Venus, the goddess of love, or her son, Cupid, is accompanying Queen Juno?	modern
Behold, I have a weapon.	shakespearean
Cancel his bond of life, dear God I pray, That I may live to say, “The dog is dead.”	shakespearean
I’ll lie down here and measure out my grave.	modern
Yes Signior?	modern
Banquo and Donalbain!	shakespearean
What, is Brutus sick, And will he steal out of his wholesome bed, To dare the vile contagion of the night And tempt the rheumy and unpurgèd air To add unto his sickness?	shakespearean
Oh, they continually urged the king to do it.	modern
Naked,” he says.	modern
I saw Bassanio and Antonio say goodbye.	modern
Francis Flute, the bellows-mender?	shakespearean
So go.	modern
Ten masts at each make not the altitude Which thou hast perpendicularly fell.	shakespearean
She creeps along.	modern
Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly, And all the gods go with you!	shakespearean
Two of them have the very bent of honor, And if their wisdoms be misled in this, The practice of it lives in John the Bastard, Whose spirits toil in frame of villainies.	shakespearean
Oh, what misery!	modern
In just an hour from now, Duchess of York, I’ll be saluting you as the mother of two beautiful queens.	modern
I’ll bet any man who knows the law five shillings to one on it.	modern
Draw your sword!	modern
You will be schoolmaster And undertake the teaching of the maid: That’s your device.	shakespearean
Trust not Trebonius.	shakespearean
Will I hear from you soon?	modern
Therefore the moon, the governess of floods, Pale in her anger, washes all the air, That rheumatic diseases do abound.	shakespearean
But did you tell him she cheated on him?	modern
But I know none, and therefore am no beast.	shakespearean
I even knew the tailor who made the disguise she wore when she ran off.	modern
Yes, God be praised, I have managed to earn his favor.	modern
Amen to that, Gonzalo.	modern
Take out your sword and come on.	modern
Well praised!	shakespearean
No, no.	modern
The images of revolt and flying off.	shakespearean
When I wore it at your daughter’s marriage?	shakespearean
I’m neither, my lord.	modern
Since this fortune falls to you, Be content and seek no new.	shakespearean
What soldiers, milk-face?	modern
Wo, ha, ho!	shakespearean
Just listen a little more, and I’ll bring you up to date about the present situation, which is the whole reason I’m telling you this story in the first place.	modern
We’ll so begin these rites As we do trust they’ll end, in true delights.	shakespearean
Where are these murderers?	modern
I have been sent on ahead to light a fire, and they are coming after to warm themselves.	modern
I am tied to th' stake, and I must stand the course.	shakespearean
What’s happening to me, that I’m frightened of every noise?	modern
He will, an if he live to be a man.	shakespearean
Sir, are not you my father?	shakespearean
How’s it going, Shylock?	modern
The better for the King of heaven that hath him.	shakespearean
Strategy makes a better soldier than haste.	modern
I thank my heart—the poor fool—for it keeps away from seriousness.	modern
And I’ll sing it for the duke in the intermission of a play.	modern
We are friends.	shakespearean
Take me to him.	modern
Art thou learned?	shakespearean
I hope she will be brief.	shakespearean
Indeed, he is so.	shakespearean

We have none such, sir.	shakespearean

O Lorenzo, If thou keep promise, I shall end this strife, Become a Christian and thy loving wife.	shakespearean

Why are the branches still living when the root is gone?	modern
He should swear by his two-faced self, and that’s an oath I’ll believe!	modern
In that case, there’s reason to hope a man’s memory may outlive him by six months.	modern

With what addition?	shakespearean

I’d be just as happy if you broke his neck as his finger.	modern
And to deal plainly I fear I am not in my perfect mind.	shakespearean
To no more Will I give place or notice.	shakespearean
Tigers, not daughters, what have you performed?	shakespearean
O sinful thought!	shakespearean

Tis best to give him way.	shakespearean
By no means” what?	shakespearean
Run, my lord, run.	modern

You did it?	modern
We want to hear Caesar’s will.	modern

Whisper to her that Ursula and I are walking in the orchard and that we’re talking all about her.	modern
O Stephano, two Neapolitans ’scaped!	shakespearean
But do you think that’s what he’s aiming for?	modern

Learn of the wise and perpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar, the very uncleanly flux of a cat.	shakespearean
Ay, my lord.	shakespearean
I’m sure the duke will never allow this contract to be enforced.	modern
Either thou, Macbeth, Or else my sword with an unbattered edge I sheathe again undeeded.	shakespearean

Shall we call in th' ambassador, my liege?	shakespearean
Goodbye, boy.	modern
But, sir, here comes your servant.	modern
Oh, was she now?	modern

I fear my Thisbe’s promise is forgot!— And thou, O Wall, O sweet, O lovely Wall, That stand’st between her father’s ground and mine.	shakespearean
What, up and down, carved like an apple tart?	shakespearean
But it is no English treason to cut French crowns, and tomorrow the king himself will be a clipper.	shakespearean
Signor Antonio?	modern
I’m going to make you look sharp, Laertes.	modern
Whatever you are, thanks for your advice.	modern
Honest, my lord?	shakespearean
Unto bad causes swear Such creatures as men doubt.	shakespearean
On top of this, they’ve either burned or carried away everything that was in the king’s tent.	modern
As long as there are	modern
I spoke angry, foul words to him, and with that I will kiss you.	modern
Well, as time shall try.	shakespearean
Here’s a maze trod indeed Through forthrights and meanders.	shakespearean
The several messengers From hence attend dispatch.	shakespearean
Clever lies.	modern
The leftovers from the funeral dinner made a convenient wedding banquet.	modern
Who are you?	modern
Yes, I see them coming.	modern
O heavens, that they were living both in Naples, The king and queen there!	shakespearean
Cover the sky with a low-hanging fog, as dark as hell, and get these overeager rivals so completely lost in the woods that they can’t run into each other.	modern
Hate it, fear it, do not come inside.	modern
And, moreover, God saw him when he was hid in the garden.	shakespearean
This is the day which, in King Edward’s time, I wished might fall on me when I was found False to his children and his wife’s allies.	shakespearean
Alas, grim death, how vile and ugly your near-twin, sleep, is!	modern
There were none principal.	shakespearean
We should have else desired your good advice— Which still hath been both grave and prosperous— In this day’s council, but we’ll take tomorrow.	shakespearean
Will you marry us here, under this tree, or should we follow you to your chapel?	modern
I charge thee, be not thou more grieved than I am.	shakespearean
Shall I entreat a word?	shakespearean
Good morning to you.	modern
Do you know who I am?	modern
Stay warm.	modern
And speak parrot?	shakespearean
So the spirit is eased.	shakespearean
Tell him I’m sick.	modern
No, no, they wouldn’t.	modern
I think it’s my bad eyesight that’s making me see this horrible vision.	modern

He was my friend, faithful and just to me.	shakespearean
It has hatched a    I go unwillingly.	modern

Do we but find the tyrant’s power tonight, Let us be beaten if we cannot fight.	shakespearean
Tongue nor heart cannot conceive nor name thee!	shakespearean
Never till this day Saw I him touched with anger so distempered.	shakespearean
Don’t I tell you in the clearest terms that I do not and cannot love you?	modern
It’s over here.	modern
The worst fault you have is to be in love.	shakespearean
Last thing he did, dear Queen, He kissed—the last of many doubled kisses— This orient pearl.	shakespearean
I can’t believe that.	modern
Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.	shakespearean
You speak this to fetch me in, my lord.	shakespearean
They made him drink the leftover wine usually given to the poor.	modern
I’ll do well.	modern
Keep your word.	modern
Say you?	shakespearean
Or else she could not have the wit to do this.	shakespearean
My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.	shakespearean
He gave Syria, Cilicia, and Phoenicia to Ptolemy.	modern
He doesn’t know he’s been appointed governor yet.	modern

Almost at odds with morning, which is which.	shakespearean
Stay not to answer me, but get thee gone.	shakespearean
It’s too hot.	modern
Oh, it’s a disaster, a disaster, by this hand, it’s a disaster.	modern
That is my rest; that is the rendezvous of it.	shakespearean
Oh, what a relief!	modern
O wonderful, wonderful, and most wonderful wonderful, and yet again wonderful, and after that, out of all whooping!	shakespearean
I’ve never seen the waters so disturbed.	modern
The sleeping and the dead Are but as pictures.	shakespearean
The king has agreed to every point: first his daughter, then everything else, as you strictly proposed.	modern
Why, last night.	modern
Iras, long farewell.	shakespearean
Yes, and more.	modern
Yes, I swear.	modern
My gallant girls!	modern
Why then, lead on.	shakespearean
What’s the reason for this horrible shouting?	modern
I must go report what happened.	modern

And lawfully by this the Jew may claim A pound of flesh to be by him cut off Nearest the merchant’s heart.—Be merciful.	shakespearean
Is it upon record, or else reported Successively from age to age, he built it?	shakespearean
Yes, my lord.	modern
Nay, but swear ’t.	shakespearean
Bottom, you’re Pyramus.—And Flute, you’re Thisbe.	modern
My Regan counsels well.	shakespearean
Ay me!	shakespearean
Let me at her!.	modern
These vows are just traps for stupid birds.	modern
It ripens towards it.	shakespearean
And it might back up other evidence that may seem too flimsy.	modern
My lord, that dirty clown whom you laughed at so often is also missing.	modern
Speak yet again.	shakespearean
And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour, And not obedient to his honest will, What is she but a foul contending rebel And graceless traitor to her loving lord?	shakespearean
It is backed like a weasel.	shakespearean
Get thee to bed.	shakespearean
Why thou, loss upon loss!	shakespearean
Oh, darling Orlando, it’s so hard to see you wearing your heart in a sling.	modern
Yet, in reason, no man should possess him with any appearance of fear, lest he, by showing it, should dishearten his army.	shakespearean
Before God, and in my mind, very wise.	shakespearean
Where’s Publius?	shakespearean
Should be”—should buzz!	shakespearean
The manner of their deaths?	shakespearean
He is a subject for a king to contemplate, and for a king’s king to ride on, and for the world at large—both friend and stranger—to stop whatever they are doing and marvel at.	modern
Run to your houses, fall upon your knees, Pray to the gods to intermit the plague That needs must light on this ingratitude.	shakespearean
Depending on what we plant—weeds or lettuce, or one kind of herb rather than a variety, the garden will either be barren and useless, or rich and productive.	modern
Yes, my lord.	modern
Thou most lying slave, Whom stripes may move, not kindness!	shakespearean
I never caused her any harm, as far as I know.	modern
Come, go with me; Under our tents I’ll play the eavesdropper To see if any mean to shrink from me.	shakespearean
Well then, the peace which you before so urged Lies in his answer.	shakespearean
O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous.	shakespearean
She can stay at her father’s house.	modern

So, please, my lord, don’t assume that I’m treacherous just because I’m poor, with no titles to my name.	modern
I’ll not be far from you.	shakespearean
Go into the bedroom and see for yourself.	modern
I will go out.	modern
Yet marked I where the bolt of Cupid fell.	shakespearean
But this rough magic I here abjure, and when I have required Some heavenly music, which even now I do, To work mine end upon their senses that This airy charm is for, I’ll break my staff, Bury it certain fathoms in the earth, And deeper than did ever plummet sound I’ll drown my book.	shakespearean
We’re all waiting for the revenge!	modern
The sun will never be seen by such royal eyes again.	modern
This epitaph will hang here forever, Continuing to praise Hero after I die.	modern
Go armed.	shakespearean
I don’t think so!	modern
If we’d fought like this before, we’d have driven them home with bandaged heads.	modern
It doesn’t matter.	modern
I have broke with her father and his goodwill obtained.	shakespearean
Retire we to our chamber.	shakespearean
I smile and think, “Thank goodness the wind doesn’t flatter me: it’s like a councilor who makes me feel what I’m really made of.” Adversity can have its benefits—like the ugly, poisonous  I wouldn’t change my situation for anything.	modern
But here’s a parchment with the seal of Caesar.	shakespearean
Where’s your conscience now?	modern
Three months from twelve, then.	shakespearean
Now near enough.	shakespearean
Why dost thou lash that whore?	shakespearean
By your most gracious pardon, I sing but after you.	shakespearean
I remember your eyes quite well.	modern
Did he stare at you?	modern
There is a man who loves you better than your husband could.	modern
Which she shall purchase with still-lasting war.	shakespearean
We need a more appropriate place to discuss Cordelia and her father.	modern
But were the day come, I should wish it dark, That I were couching with the doctor’s clerk.	shakespearean
Well, bawd I’ll turn, And something lean to cutpurse of quick hand.	shakespearean
Tis good.	shakespearean
You’ll have to bear with me.	modern
I have quarreled four times, and almost got in a fight.	modern
Your Majesty, hear now, saving your Majesty’s manhood, what an arrant, rascally, beggarly, lousy knave it is.	shakespearean
Take their examination yourself and bring it me.	shakespearean
Yare, yare, good Iras, quick.	shakespearean
Caesar gets money where He loses hearts.	shakespearean
There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice Proposing with the Prince and Claudio.	shakespearean
For the sake of our old friendship, I ask you, hold my sword handle while I run on it.	modern
For the love of God, be patient with him.	modern
Yes, my lord.	modern
But it would warm his spirits To hear from me you had left Antony And put yourself under his shroud, The universal landlord.	shakespearean
Is that why you’re talking so wildly?	modern
Bless your five senses!	modern
Speak the word along.	shakespearean
In my travels, great scholars have come up to me, meaning to greet me with well-rehearsed welcoming speeches, and I have seen them tremble and turn pale, and pause inappropriately in the middle of their sentences, and botch their well-rehearsed tones of voice because they’re so nervous, and then break off abruptly at the end, without actually welcoming me.	modern
Spoken like a gentleman.	modern
Come out, I order you.	modern
If anyone here knows a better way to tame a shrew, speak up, please.	modern
Think you but that I know our state secure, I would be so triumphant as I am?	shakespearean
But when we in our viciousness grow hard— Oh, misery on ’t!—the wise gods seel our eyes, In our own filth drop our clear judgments, make us Adore our errors, laugh at ’s while we strut To our confusion.	shakespearean
Actually I think I would, and then I’d undo it after I did it.	modern
What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbor?	shakespearean
What noise?	shakespearean
No one ever gave a prayer like that before going to sleep.	modern
To invite my former boss, the Jew, to dine tonight with my new master, the Christian.	modern
Pardon me.	shakespearean
Great Mark Antony Is now a widower.	shakespearean
How many people who are humble now would be great then?	modern
Retire thee, go where thou art billeted.	shakespearean
Welcome, my good friends.	modern
A fire, good Curtis.	shakespearean
Indeed, Hero herself can!	modern
I know our country disposition well.	shakespearean
Is Signior Lucentio within, sir?	shakespearean
Kinsmen, I hope the time is coming when people will be safe in their own bedrooms.	modern
On, to the field!	shakespearean
Thanks to your Highness.	shakespearean
Let us leave him.	shakespearean
They killed your wife, your children, your servants, anyone they could find.	modern
Answer me that first.	modern
For heaven’s sake, stop this savage brawl!	modern
There’s two or three of us have seen strange sights.	shakespearean
Captain Macmorris, I think, see—correct me if I’m wrong—there are not many of your nation— My nation?	modern
Like the  Oh stop it, you lusty bed-hopper.	modern
Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius, That you would have me seek into myself For that which is not in me?	shakespearean
Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men, As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs, Shoughs, water-rugs, and demi-wolves are clept All by the name of dogs.	shakespearean
So is the bargain.	shakespearean
Heaven help us!	modern
Well, do your discretion.	shakespearean
The violet smells to him as it doth to me.	shakespearean
Tis such another fitchew.	shakespearean
How did you get this letter?	modern
I don’t understand why they’re all here together.	modern
That’s the way it goes.	modern
But tell me—which of my good qualities first made you suffer love for me?	modern
The wolves have finished preying for the night, and look—the gentle dawn is rising, dappling the sleepy eastern sky with spots of light.	modern
It is “never tire.” Oh.	shakespearean
You’re so infatuated with him that you’re hallucinating.	modern
I’ll write to my sister and tell her my plans.	modern
If you’ve got any music that can’t be heard, then play that.	modern
What does she want?	modern
Fool, do not flatter.	shakespearean
Sovereign of Egypt, hail!	shakespearean
If that you were the good Sir Rowland’s son, As you have whispered faithfully you were, And as mine eye doth his effigies witness Most truly limned and living in your face, Be truly welcome hither.	shakespearean
Ely joining Richmond troubles me more than Buckingham and his quickly assembled army.	modern
If that’s what you want, all right.	modern
Half afeard to come.	shakespearean
But he hath chid me hence and threatened me To strike me, spurn me—nay, to kill me too.	shakespearean
I wish I could give you the little strength that I have.	modern
O Antony!	shakespearean
A guiltless death I die.	shakespearean
Did you leave on good terms?	modern
Our size of sorrow, Proportioned to our cause, must be as great As that which makes it.	shakespearean
Why do you sound so odd?	modern
The powers of the kingdom approach apace.	shakespearean
Marry, well remembered.	shakespearean
Your praise has beaten you home.	modern
Let heaven be my witness—I’m putting my mind, my heart, and my hands in Othello’s control.	modern
Would you not have me honest?	shakespearean
Yet thou liest in the bleak air.	shakespearean
I have a widow aunt, a dowager Of great revenue, and she hath no child.	shakespearean
I’m not sure about that.	modern
Well, look unto it.	shakespearean

You’re making me go off-key.	modern
Stay, give me drink.—Hamlet, this pearl is thine.	shakespearean
Tush, fear not, man.	shakespearean
He’s a conspirator.	modern
And even though you were brought up as a gentleman, you patiently tolerated more hardships than savages could withstand.	modern
I am not Stephano, but a cramp.	shakespearean
I do require them of you, so to use them As we shall find their merits and our safety May equally determine.	shakespearean
You are welcome here, my friends.	modern

My Lord of Warwick and my brother Gloucester, follow Fluellen at a close distance.	modern
That really is an illegitimate hope.	modern
She Phoebes me.	shakespearean
If he agrees, great.	modern
John Duke of Norfolk, Walter Lord Ferrers, Sir Robert Brakenbury, and Sir William Brandon.	modern
He’s speaking now, or perhaps he’s whispering, “Where’s my serpent of the Nile?” For that’s his pet name for me.	modern
Here love, thou seest how diligent I am, To dress thy meat myself and bring it thee.	shakespearean
Why, he told me so himself, and he said he didn’t care who knew it.	modern
For he partly begs To be desired to give.	shakespearean
I think our country sinks beneath the yoke.	shakespearean
Sir, fifteen days of March have gone by.	modern
And I was going to your lodging, Cassio.	shakespearean
If your love was anything like mine—and I’m sure that no man has loved as I love now—exactly how many ridiculous actions did your fantasizing lead you to?	modern

She can turn and turn, and then turn on you again.	modern
We are spoiled and yonder he is!	shakespearean
Twas a fault unwilling.	shakespearean
Here’s one comes in his shirt, with light and weapons.	shakespearean
Ere he take ship for France, and in Southampton.	shakespearean
Did you hear that?	modern
Well she was, good Curtis, before this frost.	modern
Fast bind, fast find.	shakespearean
More will I do— Though all that I can do is nothing worth, Since that my penitence comes after all, Imploring pardon.	shakespearean
It probably has something to do with… I don’t know.	modern
He told us to arrange it.	modern
I hid me under the dead mooncalf’s gaberdine for fear of the storm.	shakespearean
Because he’s daring us to do it.	modern
I don’t know what “poetical” means.	modern
Besides, I like you not.	shakespearean
No, instead I’ll go to Benedick and advise him to fight his emotions.	modern
You think I’ll weep?	shakespearean
Stand thee close, then, under this penthouse, for it drizzles rain, and I will, like a true drunkard, utter all to thee.	shakespearean
On what occasion God He knows, not I, The queen your mother and your brother York Have taken sanctuary.	shakespearean

I think thou dost.	shakespearean
Advise the duke where you are going, to a most festinate preparation.	shakespearean
Oh, my soul’s joy!	shakespearean
So bless thee, master.	shakespearean
Do we so.	shakespearean
I am so lated in the world that I Have lost my way forever.	shakespearean
So then why should I offer this womanish defense that I’m innocent?	modern
Treat Desdemona well.	modern
That will I, should I die the hour after.	shakespearean
Shall I descend?	shakespearean
Had I not Four or five women once that tended me?	shakespearean
Why, you speak truth.	shakespearean
Prithee, who is ’t that thou mean’st?	shakespearean
Why do you dress me In borrowed robes?	shakespearean
Good morrow, worthy Caesar.	shakespearean

Sawst thou the melancholy Lord Northumberland?	shakespearean
Come on in, tailor.	modern
What means your grace?	shakespearean
But gilded tombs contain worms.	modern
Didn’t I turn down the page where I left off reading?	modern
If thou say so, withdraw and prove it too.	shakespearean
There’s warrant in that theft Which steals itself when there’s no mercy left.	shakespearean
My life upon her faith!—Honest Iago, My Desdemona must I leave to thee.	shakespearean
My dear Gloucester!	modern
His lips were nice and red, a little more lively and passionate than the red that was in his cheeks—one was pure red and the other more pink.	modern
I know not, sir.	shakespearean
You’re so neat and well put-together that you look like you love yourself more than anyone else.	modern
Why, the man who shortens his life by twenty years cuts off twenty years of worrying about death.	modern
No, Cassio wasn’t killed.	modern
This treacherous Egyptian has betrayed me.	modern

The skin is good for your cracked head.	modern
But when I tell him he hates flatterers, He says he does, being then most flatterèd.	shakespearean
It’ll be my job to talk about how Benedick is sick with love for Beatrice.	modern
Rumble thy bellyful!	shakespearean
But I will not stir from this place, do what they can.	shakespearean
Bear them from hence.	shakespearean
The sin upon my head, dread sovereign, For in the Book of Numbers is it writ: “When the man dies, let the inheritance Descend unto the daughter.” Gracious lord, Stand for your own, unwind your bloody flag, Look back into your mighty ancestors.	shakespearean
How is your majesty doing?	modern
What else you do know?	modern
No, my lord, that was me.	modern

Is it so brave a lass?	shakespearean
What would you?	shakespearean
Give me answer to it.	shakespearean
And then Pyramus showed up.	modern
I was of late as petty to his ends As is the morn-dew on the myrtle leaf To his grand sea.	shakespearean

Then it’s confirmed!	modern
There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave To tell us this.	shakespearean

What is she saying, my lord?	modern
Incapable and shallow innocents, You cannot guess who caused your father’s death.	shakespearean
There is no jewel like Rosalind.	modern

It is.	modern
I was engaged to both of them.	modern
Yea, and text underneath: “Here dwells Benedick the married man”?	shakespearean
I may sit in a corner and cry, “Heigh-ho for a husband!” Lady Beatrice, I will get you one.	shakespearean
It’s not quite that simple.	modern
Carry your master out.	modern
What ish my nation?	shakespearean
We would have liked to have heard your good advice, which has always been serious and helpful, at the council today, but we’ll wait until tomorrow.	modern
Other countries criticize us for our loud partying.	modern
Here’s the head of that notorious traitor, the dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.	modern
Saddle my horses.	shakespearean
Let him command, And to obey shall be in me remorse, What bloody business ever.	shakespearean
Brother, I advise you to the best.	shakespearean
I’ll be no king of England if I’m not also king of France.	modern
That’s right, and then after we fixed the moon, we’d go bird-hunting.	modern
Oh, I wish I could know what will happen today before it happens!	modern
With his natural luck, he will beat you even against the odds.	modern
Friends of this country.	modern
Down from the waist they are centaurs, though women all above.	shakespearean
It doesn’t matter.	modern
Say that the last I spoke was “Antony,” And word it, prithee, piteously.	shakespearean
I’ll tarry no longer with you.	shakespearean
I should go to the barber’s, monsieur, because I think I’m getting really hairy around the face.	modern
That handkerchief Which I so loved and gave thee, thou gav’st To Cassio.	shakespearean
We hope to make the sender blush at it.	shakespearean
I’m sorry.	modern
The Count Claudio will marry Leonato’s daughter.	modern
May my wrinkles forbid that!	modern
The best thing about me is that I’m hardworking.	modern
The generals would have some words.	shakespearean
Sweet Bassanio, my ships have all miscarried.	shakespearean
But I have the meantime.	modern
Draw thy sword.	shakespearean
I hope you haven’t lost your mind.	modern
This villain of mine comes under the prediction—there’s son against father.	shakespearean
They are friends, Ratcliffe and Lovell.	shakespearean
It is my duty, sir.	shakespearean
I pray you, have a continent forbearance till the speed of his rage goes slower.	shakespearean
Be sure to burn his magic books.	modern
My lord, from head to foot.	shakespearean
Why the wrong is but a wrong i' th' world, and having the world for your labor, ’tis a wrong in your own world, and you might quickly make it right.	shakespearean
I fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old, being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth.	shakespearean
Good shepherd, tell this youth what ’tis to love.	shakespearean
My life, sir!	shakespearean
Bianca’s love made me trade places with Tranio while he masqueraded as me around town.	modern
I do beseech you That are of suppler joints, follow them swiftly And hinder them from what this ecstasy May now provoke them to.	shakespearean
The nobleman’s are as huge as the underfed villager’s.	modern
Did he confess?	modern
And Benedick is not the worst husband I can think of.	modern
But since the gibe glanced off me, ten to one it hit you both straight on.	modern
Alas, why gnaw you so your nether lip?	shakespearean
Nay, yet there’s more in this.	shakespearean
Did he confess it?	shakespearean
But for the seventh cause.	shakespearean
Each heart in Rome does love and pity you.	shakespearean
If you let go of your power to attract me, I won’t have any power to follow you.	modern
So dear I loved the man that I must weep.	shakespearean
You’ll “never trust his word after.” Come, ’tis a foolish saying.	shakespearean
Alas, poor ghost!	shakespearean
I will tell you everything, right as it fell out.	shakespearean
Down with the topmast!	shakespearean
Caesar and he are better friends than ever.	modern
What were his marks?	shakespearean
Twas I, but ’tis not I. I do not shame To tell you what I was, since my conversion So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.	shakespearean
Dolabella, I will always be in debt to you.	modern
Officer, I’ll take the responsibility from you, and the blame too.	modern
I’ll marry the earl of Warwick’s youngest daughter, Lady Anne.	modern
Please, give me that goblet, if you love me.	modern
It would please him very much if you would rely on his wealth and success to support you.	modern
You have done that you should be sorry for.	shakespearean
There’s husbandry in heaven; Their candles are all out.	shakespearean
I like the new tire within excellently, if the hair were a thought browner; and your gown’s a most rare fashion, i' faith.	shakespearean
The dog returns to its own vomit, and the newly washed sow to its mud puddle.” You’d take anything for a mistress.	modern
Since it’s drizzling, stand under this overhang with me and, like a true drunk, I’ll tell you everything.	modern
The more I suffer, the more spiteful he becomes.	modern
We’ll speak with thee at sea.	shakespearean
If it please you.	shakespearean
No, definitely not!	modern
And then he drew a dial from his poke And, looking on it with lackluster eye, Says very wisely, “It is ten o'clock.	shakespearean
Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the days; Compare dead happiness with living woe; Think that thy babes were sweeter than they were, And he that slew them fouler than he is.	shakespearean
Hear me a word, For I shall never speak to thee again.	shakespearean
That’s  Signior Baptista, will you really be this cruel?	modern
I mean, what do the words say?	modern
These were sweet omens!	modern
On record, my gracious lord.	modern
To prison, until you’re called into court.	modern
Oh, the more angel she, And you the blacker devil!	shakespearean
As a walled town is more worthier than a village, so is the forehead of a married man more honorable than the bare brow of a bachelor.	shakespearean
I will play the swan.	shakespearean
Bring me to Antony.	shakespearean
And when will you see him again?	modern
O, how we joy to see your wit restored!	shakespearean
What, you mean my face?	shakespearean
But gentle heavens, don’t keep me waiting.	modern
Is this the Prince’s brother?	modern
And it’s all your fault.	modern
Let every man be master of his time Till seven at night.	shakespearean
Nah, I’ll never be aware of my own wit, until I break my shins on it.	modern
And didn’t they place the wreath of victory on my brow and order me to give it to you?	modern
I’ll help out, if only because he speaks the same language as me.	modern
What a lying, drunken monster.	modern
He cannot like her long.	shakespearean
And would I have ever done that to you?	modern
And you shall speak In the same pulpit whereto I am going, After my speech is ended.	shakespearean
You didn’t arrive like Caesar’s sister.	modern
Masters, play here, I will content your pains.	shakespearean
Marry, for my part, I think the duke hath lost never a man, but one that is like to be executed for robbing a church, one Bardolph, if your Majesty know the man.	shakespearean
Wast born i' th' forest here?	shakespearean
But don’t let me keep you from going, Cassius.	modern
You’re cold, cold, and you were never hot with lust.	modern
Go to the pulpit, Brutus.	shakespearean
Good morrow, Caesar.	shakespearean
List a word.	shakespearean
No, lieutenant—God, gentlemen—Help—Lieutenant—sir, Montano—Help, men!—The night guard is coming!	modern
Oh, yes I am, father.	modern
I’m tired and feeling heavy, but I can’t sleep.	modern
Tis he.	shakespearean
O my heart!	shakespearean
Nothing that interests me, my good lord.	modern
Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona, That which so often you did bid me steal.	shakespearean
Why then, God forgive me.	shakespearean
And yon tall anchoring bark,	shakespearean
Thou think’st ’tis much that this contentious storm Invades us to the skin.	shakespearean
Since Cleopatra died I have lived in such dishonor that the gods Detest my baseness.	shakespearean
The time of universal peace is near.	shakespearean
I did too, and he also swore he would marry her tonight.	modern
Come on, assay.	shakespearean
Well, you’ve given away all your other rightful titles.	modern
Were I my father, coz, would I do this?	shakespearean
Descend, brother, I say.	shakespearean
They did entreat me to acquaint her of it, But I persuaded them, if they loved Benedick, To wish him wrestle with affection And never to let Beatrice know of it.	shakespearean
There to meet with Macbeth.	shakespearean
He hath refused it in the open court.	shakespearean
Now, my lord.	shakespearean
Why, know’st thou any harm’s intended towards him?	shakespearean
Methinks I do.	shakespearean
Go comfort your cousin.	shakespearean
Good evening, brother.	modern
Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor.	shakespearean
That’s true, and with good reason.	modern
Set on thy wife to observe.	shakespearean
Shall we go seek Benedick and tell him of her love?	shakespearean
I am glad he’s coming, however he’s dressed.	modern
Oh, make them joyful!	modern
What do you think about it?	modern
He’s lost his comrades and is wandering around looking for them.	modern
I’m dying to hear your life story, which must be a strange tale.	modern
Your Majesty, see here—if it won’t offend your Grace—what a complete, rascally, beggarly, lousy rat this is.	modern
Tis Banquo’s then.	shakespearean
Why not, my lord?	shakespearean
Hey out there!	modern
We may as bootless spend our vain command Upon th' enragèd soldiers in their spoil As send precepts to the Leviathan To come ashore.	shakespearean
I don’t know where he’s staying, so if I told you he’s sleeping here or there, I’d be lying.	modern
O thou public commoner!	shakespearean
These are bad omens, but I hope, I hope, they don’t predict my future.	modern
Alas the day!	shakespearean
If it pleases Caesar to be so good to himself as to hear me, I’ll try to get him to do what’s good for him.	modern
Farewell, sweet masters both.	shakespearean
And be a happy mother by the deed.	shakespearean
Send to his brother.	shakespearean
As she is mine, I may dispose of her— Which shall be either to this gentleman Or to her death—according to our law Immediately provided in that case.	shakespearean
He’s definitely drunk now.	modern
I will speak to this fellow.—Whose grave’s this, sirrah?	shakespearean
But they are dead, and you killed them, you slave of the devil.	modern
From head to toe?	modern
We’ll go forward with you and meet them at Philippi.	modern
Then tell me If this might be a brother.	shakespearean
Help, ho!	shakespearean
I would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn the contrary, if Hero would be my wife.	shakespearean
There isn’t enough leek left for you to swear on.	modern
The king was wearing exactly this armor when he fought the king of Norway.	modern
Listen, Clitus.	modern
If you pardon, we will mend.	shakespearean
We’ll burn his body in the holy place, And with the brands fire the traitors' houses.	shakespearean
Why, what is there to do before I get there?	modern
And never, since the middle summer’s spring, Met we on hill, in dale, forest, or mead, By pavèd fountain, or by rushy brook, Or in the beachèd margent of the sea, To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind, But with thy brawls thou hast disturbed our sport.	shakespearean
Monster, I smell like horse piss, which is making my nose pretty upset.	modern
Unbutton here.	shakespearean
This one talks about how Roderigo should kill Cassio.	modern
I wish you well.	modern
Oh, beware, my lord, of jealousy!	shakespearean
Though we have lost a generous king, we are about to enjoy the benefits of a new king.	modern
Hath she forgot already that brave prince, Edward, her lord, whom I some three months since Stabbed in my angry mood at Tewkesbury?	shakespearean
I have a daughter (I have her until she gets married) who’s given me this letter, considering it her duty.	modern
Ma'am, you wouldn’t treat me like this if I were your father’s dog.	modern
Sometime am I All wound with adders who with cloven tongues Do hiss me into madness.	shakespearean
And leave out thee?	shakespearean
What does this mean?	modern
As birds do, Mother.	shakespearean
That can’t happen.	modern
But if it be a sin to covet honor, I am the most offending soul alive.	shakespearean
I wish you could tell him I saved his brother.	modern
Give me one good reason to think she’s cheating on me.	modern
And he challenged you to a duel?	modern
Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking?	shakespearean
Stand from the hearse.	shakespearean
He is or ta'en or slain.	shakespearean
But thou with mildness entertain’st thy wooers, With gentle conference, soft and affable.	shakespearean
Pray you, tread softly, that the blind mole may not hear a foot fall.	shakespearean
Tell Ventidius I want to speak with him.	modern
And when your honors mean to solemnize The bargain of your faith, I do beseech you Even at that time I may be married too.	shakespearean
Hello, sir.	modern
Rise, princes, and, with a spirit of honor more sharply edged than your swords, rush to the battlefield: Charles Delabreth, High Constable of France; you dukes of Orléans, Bourbon, Berri, Alençon, Brabant, Bar, and Burgundy; Jaques Chatillon, Rambures, Vaudemont, Beaumont, Grandpré, Roussi, and Fauconberg, Foix, Lestrale, Bouciqualt, and Charolois.	modern
She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of that.	shakespearean
Yes, I am.	modern
You don’t know how quickly affection can be killed with a single nasty word.	modern
When Caesar says, “do this,” it is performed.	shakespearean
And I am sick when I look not on you.	shakespearean
And you say he’s not jealous?	modern
And so far I’m pleased with the way things have turned out, since I find all of this commotion very entertaining.	modern
Even the traits that become me most kill me when you don’t approve of them.	modern
And what oath do we need other than that we honest men have told each other that this will happen or we will die trying?	modern
You’ll do no such thing.	modern
What did he do when you saw him?	modern
The gain I seek is quiet in the match.	shakespearean
Cheer up, because I think you’re going to hell.	modern
How can this drama be so many contradictory things?	modern
Hath she made her affection known to Benedick?	shakespearean
My royal lord, you’re not entertaining the guests.	modern
If then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer: not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved Rome more.	shakespearean
If you get what you want and you’re still not happy, you’ve spent everything and gained nothing.	modern
Separate them.	modern
Have you heard of no likely wars toward ’twixt the two Dukes of Cornwall and Albany?	shakespearean
My leg is cut in two.	shakespearean
Are you my wife and will not call me “husband”?	shakespearean
The Queen approaches.	shakespearean
We have two hours To furnish us.	shakespearean
Thanks, my dear lord.	modern
Caesar was a tyrant.	modern
When I raise my hand, you do the same, and bring it down on Gonzalo’s head.	modern
Good Cinna, take this paper, And look you lay it in the praetor’s chair Where Brutus may but find it.	shakespearean
His bark is stoutly timbered and his pilot Of very expert and approved allowance Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death, Stand in bold cure.	shakespearean
I swear to God I won’t.	modern
Oh, it’s as easy as lying.	modern
Indeed he is not fit.	shakespearean
I have responsibilities in this war, and as the absolute ruler of my kingdom I will carry out my duties as if I were a man.	modern
I didn’t think I would see you here.	modern
Beware the thane of Fife.	modern
It’s just that my wit is very gentlemanly, Margaret, and refuses to hurt a woman.	modern
I’ll miss you, Ariel, but you’ll be free.—Yes, you will, yes.—Go to the king’s ship in your invisible state.	modern
Good my lord, enter.	shakespearean
Sister, I have a lot to say about things that concern us both.	modern
Fie upon “But yet.” “But yet” is as a jailer to bring forth Some monstrous malefactor.	shakespearean
I’ll tell thee, Charles: it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full of ambition, an envious emulator of every man’s good parts, a secret and villainous contriver against me his natural brother.	shakespearean
So shall you quietly enjoy your hope And marry sweet Bianca with consent.	shakespearean
If you like, we’ll stand by and wait to do whatever you need.	modern
How comes this trick upon him?	shakespearean
What a backward world we live in!	modern
But, brother, I can tell you strange news that you yet dreamt not of.	shakespearean
My heart feels like it’s full of poisonous snakes!	modern
Well, sir, I’ll take you to Lear and have you stay with him a while.	modern
Do ’t.	shakespearean
I won’t be taken for a fool who sighs and gives in to Christian meddlers.	modern
How dost thou and thy master agree?	shakespearean
You mean this is the whole problem, that she is shy and hasn’t said everything she means to say and do?—My lord of Burgundy, what do you have to say to this lady?	modern
What likelihood of his amendment, lords?	shakespearean
But who is this?	modern
The merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome Are all too dear for me.	shakespearean
I’ll do as you say, father.	modern
It is not friendly, ’tis not maidenly.	shakespearean
Believe it.	modern
Launcelot, what’s going on?	modern
You have wonderful armor, but give my horse his due.	modern
It sorts well with your fierceness.	shakespearean
I think the world’s asleep.	shakespearean
The Queen, my lord, the Queen.	shakespearean
No more than a minute?	modern
No doubt the murderous knife was blunt till it was sharpened on your stony heart—you reveled in my lambs' bloody guts.	modern
And I understand perfectly his sneering reference to my wilder days.	modern
And you too, gentle Hero?	shakespearean
Good my lord, tell it.	shakespearean
I fear thou wilt once more come again for a ransom.	shakespearean
You asked for justice, so rest assured you’ll get more justice than you bargained for.	modern
What, girl, though gray Do something mingle with our younger brown, yet ha’ we A brain that nourishes our nerves and can Get goal for goal of youth.	shakespearean
Labio and Flavio, set our battles on.	shakespearean
I’ll drink it if I like.	modern
Is not that he that lies upon the ground?	shakespearean
By my father’s death— Your life has dishonored his death.	modern
Who’s Thisbe?	modern
I am not in the giving vein today.	shakespearean
Our gracious brother, I will go with them.	shakespearean
He is attended with a desperate train.	shakespearean
I’ll fetch some flax and whites of eggs To apply to his bleeding face.	shakespearean
There’s money in it for you.	modern
I dreamed last night that I feasted with Caesar, and unlucky signs overwhelmed my imagination.	modern
Ay, every inch a king.	shakespearean
I remember the plan.	modern
So were their daggers, which we found on their pillows, unwiped.	modern
I pray you mar no more trees with writing love songs in their barks.	shakespearean
A vengeance on your crafty withered hide!	shakespearean
He’s already done so.	modern
So what’s the story, old boy?	modern
So will it fare with Claudio.	shakespearean
Where is Montjoy, the herald?	modern
What hast thou been?	shakespearean
Learn from the wise, and comprehend: the courtier’s perfume is made from cat discharge—much more disgusting than tar.	modern
If we leave, it will feel like nothing less than death to them.	modern
He was but a fool that brought My answer back.	shakespearean
Marry, this it is, sir.	shakespearean
Did I not meet thy friends?	shakespearean
Why, because we’re always handling our ewes, and their fleece, as you know, is greasy.	modern
What wound did ever heal but by degrees?	shakespearean
Her worth is carried on the wind And it blows throughout the world, carrying the name of Rosalind.	modern
He gives you upon his knees a thousand thanks, and he esteems himself happy that he hath fall'n into the hands of one, as he thinks, the most brave, valorous, and thrice- worthy seigneur of England.	shakespearean
Then bid adieu to me, and say the tears Belong to Egypt.	shakespearean
We have been praying for our husbands' welfare, Which speed, we hope, the better for our words.	shakespearean
Has Banquo left the court?	modern
By Chrish, la, ’tish ill done.	shakespearean
But I do think it’s the husband’s fault if we wives cheat on them.	modern
Do I have the asp’s poison on my lips?	modern
I never may believe These antique fables nor these fairy toys.	shakespearean
What tidings can you tell me of my lord?	shakespearean
I meant plain holy thistle.	shakespearean
They’re very anxious for you to get there.	modern
Be thou assured, good Cassio, I will do All my abilities in thy behalf.	shakespearean
No, Caesar doesn’t have epilepsy.	modern
I’ll tell you in your ear.	shakespearean
He received them Of him that brought them.	shakespearean
How satisfied, my lord?	shakespearean
To fright you thus methinks I am too savage; To do worse to you were fell cruelty, Which is too nigh your person.	shakespearean
Now, my sweet lord, you know how much I like you.	modern
Your shoes are in pretty bad shape.	modern
Both sides are even.	shakespearean
I’d rather be anything besides a fool.	modern
You have no stomach, Signior.	shakespearean
Let’s drink through midnight.	modern
Nay, but I know who loves him.	shakespearean
Caesar, you are revenged with the very same sword that killed you.	modern
No, you monstrous hags, I’ll get revenge on you both that will make the whole world… I will do such things—I don’t know what I’ll do exactly, but it’ll be devastating.	modern
What will you give me now For the same handkerchief?	shakespearean
What did I promise, my dear?	modern
Why, this' a heavy chance ’twixt him and you, Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio.	shakespearean
Come here, Leonato.	modern
They grow like savages—like soldiers who meditate on nothing but blood—surrounded by swearing and stern looks, ragged clothing and everything unnatural.	modern
Here I stand, your slave— A poor, infirm, weak, and despised old man.	shakespearean
Talkers aren’t good doers.	modern
I could have sworn he trampled on me.	modern
My Queen and Eros Have by their brave instruction got upon me A nobleness in record.	shakespearean
But in my terms of honor I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement Till by some elder masters, of known honor, I have a voice and precedent of peace To keep my name ungored.	shakespearean
Mine nightingale, We have beat them to their beds.	shakespearean
A sailor’s wife had chestnuts in her lap, And munched, and munched, and munched.	shakespearean
Yes, but not out of fear.	modern
Don’t delay.	modern
But be quiet, here comes Thisbe.	modern
Be wise, and get you home.	shakespearean
But, my lord, this boy was born in the forest and has been schooled not in the usual subjects but only in magic.	modern
Oh Dardanius!	modern
No, Lysander.	modern
God be at your table.	shakespearean
Noble captain, come.	shakespearean
What say’st thou, noble heart?	shakespearean
I’ll get it from you, I swear.	modern
He looks humbler than he used to.	modern
Didn’t you figure out that I left you because I hate you?	modern
If he’s caught the Benedick, he’ll lose all his money before he’s cured.	modern
Nor will you tender less.	shakespearean
Even though she’s as similar to Goneril as one crabapple is like another, still… I know what I know.	modern
Judging from his appearance, I bet he can tell us the latest news about the revolt.	modern
Why, one that swears and lies.	shakespearean
Do you think I’ll be forsworn?	shakespearean
That’s the truth, sir.	modern
I shall remember.	shakespearean
Promising favors?	modern
Let the gods who stirred up this dreadful storm bring their enemies to light.	modern
You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra.	shakespearean
Before you hazard, for in choosing wrong I lose your company.	shakespearean
Make a bug show of mourning for her, hang sad epitaphs up at your family’s tomb, and perform all the appropriate burial ceremonies.	modern
Make all the money thou canst.	shakespearean
He’s having dinner tonight with a prostitute, and I’ll go visit him.	modern
And now about the cauldron sing, Like elves and fairies in a ring, Enchanting all that you put in.	shakespearean
Poor Tom has been scared out of his mind.	modern
O eastern star!	shakespearean
Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest!	shakespearean
Then Octavia’s complaints will rouse Caesar, and as I said before, the thing that brought them together will part them.	modern
I’m ordering you, go home.	modern
Please put up with my weakness.	modern
I fear that your words and your heart are both false.	modern
Sir, sir, be patient.	shakespearean
These letters give, Iago, to the pilot, And by him do my duties to the senate.	shakespearean
And we understand him well, How he comes o'er us with our wilder days, Not measuring what use we made of them.	shakespearean
Rest assured that we’re going there to use our hands, not our tongues.	modern
Go and importune her.	shakespearean
By Jesus, I am your Majesty’s countryman, and I don’t care who knows it.	modern
You can have a whole story, not just a word.	modern
Tis good we do so.	shakespearean
Bring us the letter.	shakespearean
But fare ye well.	shakespearean
Pain, yes indeed.	modern
I have received letters that say the same.	modern
Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.	shakespearean
Is it your own inclining?	shakespearean
The crown was offered to him three times?	modern
Unkindness may do much, And his unkindness may defeat my life, But never taint my love.	shakespearean
Well, you are gone both ways.	shakespearean
All right.	modern
He’s great-looking, but how can you talk to someone who doesn’t speak your language?	modern
Nay, like enough, for I stay dinner there.	shakespearean
He only married out of political necessity.	modern
What would you say to me now if I really were your precious little Rosalind?	modern
O braggart vile and damnèd furious wight, The grave doth gape, and doting death is near.	shakespearean
We must not now displease him.	shakespearean
Can we do that?	modern
For these fellows of infinite tongue, that can rhyme themselves into ladies' favors, they do always reason themselves out again.	shakespearean
Bring her out, brother.	modern
Listen, listen!	modern
For a while, no play was sold to the theaters without a big fight between the children’s playwright and the actors playing adult roles.	modern
You shall not gauge me By what we do tonight.	shakespearean
Decius Brutus doesn’t love you.	modern
To his father, that so tenderly and entirely loves him.	shakespearean
But don’t you see what a    Did you hear someone?	modern
This is healthy talk.	modern
Save you, friend Cassio!	shakespearean
I overheard him and his practices.	shakespearean
They’re friends—Ratcliffe and Lovell.	modern
I’ll do the best I can, my lord.	modern
They only like things as bad as themselves.	modern
Therefore, let every man give some thought to how this noble expedition may be undertaken.	modern
Stand away from the hearse.	modern
Well, I’m not beautiful, so I hope that I can at least be chaste.	modern
You who are beautiful beyond words, calm down and let me explain myself.	modern
Let him not pass, But kill him rather.	shakespearean
For the Queen, I’ll take her to my guard.	shakespearean
Ask your husband if you doubt me.	modern
They could not, would not do ’t.	shakespearean
And the men resemble their English hounds in their loud, showy ferocity, too, leaving their brains behind with their wives.	modern
And his unbookish jealousy must construe Poor Cassio’s smiles, gestures, and light behavior Quite in the wrong.—How do you now, lieutenant?	shakespearean
Come with me to see the duchess.	modern
Your Worship is deceived.	shakespearean
Yes, sir, very well—I’m here in your orchard.	modern
Spirits, which by mine art I have from their confines called to enact My present fancies.	shakespearean
I did love you once.	shakespearean
Is this a prologue or the posy of a ring?	shakespearean
Will you shog off?	shakespearean
I’ll get your goats, Audrey.	modern
But with you it’s different.	modern
My lord of Orléans, and my lord high Constable, are you talking about horses and armor?	modern
It would be just like a nice daydream or fantasy.	modern
Come with us to Athens.	modern
By th' mass, and ’tis like a camel indeed.	shakespearean
A lovely, cunning shore can distract a man from the perils of a stormy sea, just as a pretty scarf can hide a dangerous dark-skinned beauty.	modern
Here I’m kneeling to swear that if I ever did anything to destroy his love for me, either by thoughts or actions, or if I ever took pleasure in anyone else, or if I never did love him, or don’t love him now—even though he tries to shake me off—	modern
That’s why I praise myself, who—if I do say so myself—is quite praiseworthy.	modern
Where art thou now?	shakespearean
But she, your subject, hates such a king.	modern
Is it not enough, is it not enough, young man, that I’ll never be pretty enough to get a kind look from Demetrius?	modern
No jutty, frieze, Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird Hath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle.	shakespearean
If I gave them all I own, I’d have two fool’s caps for myself.	modern
What, art thou waking?	shakespearean
Where’s my fool?	modern
It does have a back like a weasel’s.	modern
And come yourselves, and bring Messala with you, Immediately to us.	shakespearean
If there’s any way I can spoil his life, I’ll be overjoyed.	modern
Why should he call her “whore”?	shakespearean
Pray you, let Cassio be received again.	shakespearean
How shalt thou hope for mercy, rendering none?	shakespearean
Trip, Audrey, trip, Audrey.—I attend, I attend.	shakespearean
I see you all are bent To set against me for your merriment.	shakespearean
Tis too bad, too bad.	shakespearean
Sir, they are spoken, and these things are true.	shakespearean
I have almost forgot the taste of fears.	shakespearean
Go to the tomb of your great-grandfather, from whom your own title to the crown derives.	modern
Oh heaven, oh earth, witness what I’m about to say, and reward me if I tell the truth!	modern

The Lord Mayor knocks.	shakespearean
Has Caesar gone to the Capital yet?	modern
Is thy name William?	shakespearean
I must, she’ll rail in the street else.	shakespearean
If that be all, masters, I hear no harm.	shakespearean
If you forgive us, we’ll make everything all right.	modern
This interchange of love, I here protest, Upon my part shall be inviolable.	shakespearean
Where does he sleep?	modern

For the Dauphin, I stand here for him.	shakespearean
I am quickly ill, and well, So Antony loves.	shakespearean
I will talk further with you.	shakespearean
He says your daughter’s not feeling well, my lord.	modern
What should I do with him?	shakespearean
The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day.	shakespearean
Please, please tell me!	modern
This storm has no pity for either wise men or fools.	modern
You kill me to deny it.	shakespearean
Such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as this of Kent’s banishment.	shakespearean
Ay, my lord.	shakespearean
Oh, that was unbelievably low!	modern
Now is the time of help.	shakespearean
Please allow her to do this.	modern
Well, I hope not.	modern
Oh, let her live, and I’ll ruin her manners and her beauty.	modern
Ha, ha, heard in Genoa.	modern
Which plays, what music?	modern
My lord, whoever journeys to the prince, For God’s sake let not us two at home.	shakespearean
Why, farewell, Portia.	shakespearean
Here we’ll shake hands good-bye.	modern
Go to thy cold bed and warm thee.	shakespearean
Very well,” “go to”!	shakespearean
My lord, when at their home I did commend your highness' letters to them.	shakespearean
Well met, my lord.	shakespearean
Forever and forever farewell, Cassius.	shakespearean
I’ll give you a greater gift than that, nephew.	modern
My suit to her Is that she will to virtuous Desdemona Procure me some access.	shakespearean
Yet say I, he is in love.	shakespearean

I found not Cassio’s kisses on her lips.	shakespearean
Will you do that for me, Silvius?	modern
O Tranio, till I found it to be true, I never thought it possible or likely.	shakespearean
How lost you company?	shakespearean
If fortune be not ours today, it is Because we brave her.	shakespearean
If it turns out he wasn’t, certain people are going to get it.	modern

How are you, Lorenzo?	modern
What woman wouldn’t be distressed, being lorded over by a handful of dust?	modern
I don’t care.	modern
But please tell me more.	modern
Hortensio, hark.	shakespearean
Another way I have to man my haggard, To make her come and know her keeper’s call.	shakespearean
I curse him, but he loves me.	modern
We have two hours to get ready.	modern
What think you on ’t?	shakespearean
And is ’t not to be damned To let this canker of our nature come In further evil?	shakespearean
You all do know this mantle.	shakespearean
Keep your word, Silvius, that you’ll marry her If she refuse me.	shakespearean
That Lodovico is a good-looking man.	modern
The last of all the Romans, fare thee well!	shakespearean
Oh, fie, fie, fie!	shakespearean
What do you say?	modern
Here, you goddamn incest-breeding Danish murderer, drink this.	modern

But is he often like this?	modern
We are enough yet living in the field To smother up the English in our throngs, If any order might be thought upon.	shakespearean
Let’s hear him, for the things he speaks may concern Caesar.	shakespearean
If thou read this, O Caesar, thou mayst live.	shakespearean
We’ll meet at the giant oak tree in the duke’s forest.	modern
A nice stool.	modern
I will have to go on a journey to death soon, sir.	modern
Yet thou didst kill my children.	shakespearean
Nor I neither, by this heavenly light.	shakespearean
How am I evil to advise Cassio to do exactly what’ll do him good?	modern
Two or three men are groaning.	modern
We’ve got to give them and take them, my lord.	modern
It’s gone.	modern
Let specialties be therefore drawn between us, That covenants may be kept on either hand.	shakespearean
Have I caught thee?	shakespearean
I pant for life.	shakespearean
Please, give it to me.	modern
Speak, Pyramus.—Thisbe, stand forth.	shakespearean
By heaven, it is as proper to our age To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions As it is common for the younger sort To lack discretion.	shakespearean
And what of him?	shakespearean
No, son.	modern
Madam, not now.	shakespearean
Fetch me this herb, and be thou here again Ere the leviathan can swim a league.	shakespearean
Then weigh what loss your honor may sustain If with too credent ear you list his songs, Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open To his unmastered importunity.	shakespearean
The noblest men who ever walked on leather have walked on my handiwork.	modern
Comes not that blood as modest evidence To witness simple virtue?	shakespearean
Hast thou forgot The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy Was grown into a hoop?	shakespearean
I’ll do anything you ask, monster, anything reasonable.—Come on, Trinculo, let’s sing.	modern
Your fortunes are the same.	modern
Regan, I think you are.	shakespearean
He shall have merely justice and his bond.	shakespearean
They flatter me.	shakespearean
Neither, my lord.	shakespearean
What are you?	shakespearean
And, if you need to, approach the subject of me: tell them that when my mother became pregnant with the insatiable Edward, my noble father was fighting in France.	modern
Wrong I mine enemies?	shakespearean
Pay a surgeon to stand by and bind his wounds, Shylock, so he doesn’t bleed to death.	modern
There’s a ransom.	modern
At mine own house, good lady.	shakespearean
Call my knights together.	modern
I remember The first time ever Caesar put it on.	shakespearean
Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I.   Graybeard, thy love doth freeze.	shakespearean

Now let the wind blow, waves swell, and ships sink!	modern
Fare you well, boy.	shakespearean

Ah, you’re here?—Come on, gentlemen, let’s go!	modern
He kills her in her own humor.	shakespearean
Come not in here, nuncle.	shakespearean
O my son, my son!	shakespearean
If you poison us, don’t we die?	modern
Until now, no one could say that only one man mattered in all of vast Rome.	modern
He spends most of his time with the good, noble Claudio.	modern
I humbly thank you.	modern
Marry, as for Clarence, he is well repaid; He is franked up to fatting for his pains.	shakespearean
And so he goes to heaven.	shakespearean
The lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient.	shakespearean
I’m not sick if you’ve prepared some honorable exploit for me.	modern
And this is why your servants hang their heads in sorrow!	modern
I have drunk poison whiles he uttered it.	shakespearean
He would just see me for what I am, a person amazed to hear you talking about Naples.	modern
I will not desire that.	shakespearean
I say again, give out That Anne my queen is sick and like to die.	shakespearean
Our Queen is dead too.	modern
We’ll set thee to school to an ant to teach thee there’s no laboring i' th' winter.	shakespearean
Will it be chased away by bowing and scraping?	modern
Think you not that the powers we bear with us Will cut their passage through the force of France, Doing the execution and the act For which we have in head assembled them?	shakespearean
I’m not drunk.	modern
Where is the fellow?	shakespearean
And don’t lie.	modern
And ’tis great pity that the noble Moor Should hazard such a place as his own second With one of an ingraft infirmity.	shakespearean

Humbly on my knee I crave your blessing.	shakespearean
Who should begin?	modern
I’ll tell him all of this, dear lady.	modern
Didn’t you say something?	modern
But now, my lord.	shakespearean
He lost both, my lord.—Ma'am, this letter is from your sister, and needs an immediate answer.	modern
If he hadn’t, we’d all be embarrassed to look at him.	modern
I will, sir.	modern
Is it concluded that he shall be Protector?	shakespearean
We did, my lord, weeping and commenting Upon the sobbing deer.	shakespearean
I have done my work ill, friends.	shakespearean
And they have conspired together.	shakespearean
Oh, Kate, prudish customs bow before great kings.	modern
The king won’t live, I hope.	modern
So the poor third is up, till death enlarge his confine.	shakespearean
About it, and write “happy” when thou’st done.	shakespearean
So I’ll stay here for a while.	modern
A man old Frederick, your father, loves.	modern
Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago, If thou but think’st him wronged and mak’st his ear A stranger to thy thoughts.	shakespearean
I never looked for better at his hands After he once fell in with Mistress Shore.	shakespearean
So that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many—either to have it sterile with idleness, or manured with industry—why, the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills.	shakespearean
Isn’t that enough?	modern
Myself am Naples, Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld The king my father wracked.	shakespearean
Grace grow where those drops fall!	shakespearean
Since I have your good leave to go away, I will make haste.	shakespearean
I flashed about faster than lightning.	modern

Your lives are over.	modern
Yes, he was hotheaded even in the prime of his life.	modern
I am Christophero Sly.	shakespearean
I made you de facto rulers of my kingdom on condition that I could keep a hundred knights of my own.	modern
To me it looks like a weasel.	modern
This Caesar was a tyrant.	shakespearean
Thou art to die.	shakespearean
Let my sorrow have the upper hand.	modern
But now they rise again With twenty mortal murders on their crowns And push us from our stools.	shakespearean
Antonio, I married a woman as dear to me as life itself.	modern
Isn’t my name Hero?	modern
May you stead me?	shakespearean
Let them not live to taste this land’s increase, That would with treason wound this fair land’s peace.	shakespearean
What is your tidings?	shakespearean
My husband!	shakespearean
I don’t know any fancy ways of talking about love, only to say right out, “I love you.” If you press me any further than with the question, “Do you really?” my love scene is over.	modern
Come on, “nothing” will get you nothing.	modern
Oh, I’d rather have met my fiercest enemy in heaven, Horatio, than have lived through that terrible day!	modern
My sweet Cassio!	shakespearean
She that was ever fair and never proud, Had tongue at will and yet was never loud, Never lacked gold and yet went never gay, Fled from her wish and yet said “Now I may,” She that being angered, her revenge being nigh, Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly, She that in wisdom never was so frail To change the cod’s head for the salmon’s tail, She that could think and ne'er disclose her mind, See suitors following and not look behind, She was a wight, if ever such wights were— To do what?	shakespearean
Our shipwreck has made more women widows in Milan and Naples than there are survivors to comfort them.	modern
You’re not in love either?	modern
Her father loves you, Demetrius.	modern

Tonight let’s have plenty to eat.	modern
I’m going to tell Desdemona my feelings.	modern
If thou kill’st me, boy, thou shalt kill a man.	shakespearean
Oh, it’s horrible, horrible.	modern
I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters: To you they have showed some truth.	shakespearean
Oh yes, I heard them all, and more, too.	modern
But I have to remember that I’m here on Earth, where doing evil is often praised, and doing good is sometimes a stupid and dangerous mistake.	modern
Well, happiness to their sheets!	shakespearean
Will you come immediately?	modern
Come, gentlemen, let’s go.	shakespearean
A simple country farmer who brought her figs.	modern
What would you have said, my young York?	modern
Then leave her, sir, for by the power that made me, I tell you all her wealth.	shakespearean
He raised the house with loud and coward cries.	shakespearean
Go, some of you, And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.	shakespearean
He hath not told his thought to the king?	shakespearean
Good day to you, Captain Fluellen.	modern
The prince has done neither; therefore, in my opinion, he isn’t really protected by sanctuary.	modern
My dear Portia, if you knew who I gave the ring to, for whose sake I gave the ring to him, why I gave it to him, and how unwilling I was to leave it when he wouldn’t accept anything but the ring, you wouldn’t be so angry.	modern
To find you.	modern
It is a high-wrought flood.	shakespearean
At that time you can smash in his skull after seizing his books; or you can bash his skull with a log; or you can stab him in the belly; or cut his windpipe.	modern
Soft, sir!	shakespearean
Nay, I care not for their names.	shakespearean
Have you forgotten the torture I freed you from?	modern
Fill, Lucius, till the wine o'erswell the cup.	shakespearean
I find you passing gentle.	shakespearean
There’s only one hope for you, and even that’s a kind of illegitimate hope.	modern
If you enjoy looking at your awful deeds, take a look at this noteworthy example of your butcheries.	modern
I would have thrown away all other considerations and made her my wife.	modern
What, my lord?	shakespearean
Oh, what a sinful thought!	modern
Why, I said nothing.	shakespearean
How, in stripping it, You more invest it!	shakespearean
Friend Launcelot, what’s the news?	shakespearean
If sight and shape be true, Why then, my love adieu.	shakespearean
It’s locked away in my memory, and you’ve got the key.	modern
O, gentlemen, see, see dead Henry’s wounds Open their congealed mouths and bleed afresh!— Blush, blush, thou lump of foul deformity, For ’tis thy presence that exhales this blood From cold and empty veins where no blood dwells.	shakespearean
So do I, my lord.	shakespearean
I was killed i' th' Capitol.	shakespearean
Oh, heaven forgive me!	shakespearean
If their purgation did consist in words, They are as innocent as grace itself.	shakespearean
Who here is so barbarous that he doesn’t want to be a Roman?	modern
When the poor cried, Caesar cried too.	modern
I am in my condition A prince, Miranda—I do think, a king; I would, not so!—and would no more endure This wooden slavery than to suffer The flesh-fly blow my mouth.	shakespearean
Servants, take these gentlemen to see Hamlet.	modern
This is not the way to win your daughter.	modern
Now, by my hood, a gentle and no Jew.	shakespearean

Welcome, dear madam.	modern
I’m not sure I can wait that long.	modern

They’ll tell the clock to any business that We say befits the hour.	shakespearean
Now I’ve done a good day’s work.	modern
Come, come, you are a fool, And turned into the extremity of love.	shakespearean
Neither will I.	modern
Will he tell us what that pantomime meant?	modern
Well, we’ve missed the beginning; it’s dead and buried.	modern
I see the ruin of my house.	shakespearean
He is not lolling on a lewd love bed, But on his knees at meditation; Not dallying with a brace of courtesans, But meditating with two deep divines; Not sleeping, to engross his idle body, But praying, to enrich his watchful soul.	shakespearean
The things men are allowed to do!	modern
That’s true—if the devil’s judging her.	modern
Brother, my lord the duke, Stand to and do as we.	shakespearean
Be wise when you criticize me and keep your minds alert so you can judge me fairly.	modern
Unless I have mista'en his colors much, Which well I am assured I have not done, His regiment lies half a mile, at least, South from the mighty power of the king.	shakespearean
But there are many herbs that will help him rest and take his mind off his anguish for a while.	modern
No one will listen to it.	modern
Thou, it seems, that calls for company to countenance her.	shakespearean
I won’t trouble you yet with questions about your situation.—Some music, please, and, good friend, sing.	modern
This is the day I’m going to get what I wished for when I wished that the person I most trusted would betray me.	modern
And there comes Caesar.	modern
Another case: Hugh Capet, who usurped the crown from Charles the duke of Lorraine—sole male heir in a direct line from Charles the Great—passed himself off as heir to Lady Lingare, daughter of Charlemagne, who was the son of Lewis the Emperor (who was the son of Charles the Great), in order to give his claim to the throne more validity (though, in fact, the claim was completely false and worthless).	modern
Did you have to give them everything?	modern
Lysander, keep thy Hermia.	shakespearean
Please come with me.	modern
Once at Sardis and once last night, here in Philippi fields.	modern
Call me when it’s lit.	modern
You flea, you louse, you winter cricket!	modern
Then if he lose he makes a swanlike end, Fading in music.	shakespearean

Tis a brave army, and full of purpose.	shakespearean
Nay, I shall ne'er be ware of mine own wit till I break my shins against it.	shakespearean

Listen to me, Queen.	modern
Is the king dead, the empire unpossessed?	shakespearean
For besides the good news, we are also celebrating his marriage.	modern
Fellow Grumio!	shakespearean
Marry, once before he won it of me with false dice.	shakespearean

Yes, my good lord.	modern
Now do I see ’tis true.	shakespearean
What marvelous music!	modern
Hear me, recreant!	shakespearean
Courteous lord, one word.	shakespearean

Is there not charms By which the property of youth and maidhood May be abused?	shakespearean
Did you kill him, then?	modern
Let it be so.	shakespearean
I’m sure some Christian will resort to trickery to get you.	modern
Many thanks, Signior Gremio.	modern
He’s calling us back.	modern
What’s the news abroad?	modern
Come here, Ventidius.	modern
We see how mortal an unkindness is to them.	shakespearean
We will have such a prologue, and it shall be written in eight and six.	shakespearean
No, if you can’t adjust to political changes, you’ll suffer for it.	modern
It was a good and lucky vision.	modern
What were the primary evils he claimed women were guilty of?	modern
Go, go, good countrymen, and for this fault, Assemble all the poor men of your sort, Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears Into the channel till the lowest stream Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.	shakespearean
Then belike my children shall have no names.	shakespearean
His virtue is not hidden.	modern
Well, what’s your plan?	modern
Besides, his cote, his flocks, and bounds of feed Are now on sale, and at our sheepcote now, By reason of his absence, there is nothing That you will feed on.	shakespearean
Do you really speak like such a gentleman?	modern
Yea, and paid me richly for the practice of it.	shakespearean
What mercy can you show him, Antonio?	modern
Nothing, sir, except grandchildren.	modern
That lord that counseled thee To give away thy land, Come place him here by me.	shakespearean
Yes, I’ll grant you that.	modern
So stood the state when Henry the Sixth Was crowned in Paris but at nine months old.	shakespearean
Go, get thee gone, I say.	shakespearean
The man who gives away his crust and his crumbs Will discover that he needs some crumbs back.	modern
Don’t be so quick to twist my meaning.	modern
So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers, Doing himself offense, whilst we, lying still, Are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness.	shakespearean
The spirit torments me.	shakespearean
Nor no man else.	shakespearean
Do not so.	shakespearean
I marvel why I answered not again.	shakespearean
Cleopatra, our conquest won’t include either the things you kept back or the ones you listed.	modern
And you’ve come at a good time, so you can convey my greetings to the senators and tell them I won’t come today.	modern
Oh, sirs, if I stirred your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage, I would offend Brutus and Cassius, who, you all know, are honorable men.	modern
Ay, but the mustard is too hot a little.	shakespearean
He’s laughing already!	modern
Monster sweetie, be a good monster and just speak once.	modern
Your authorization is ready.	modern
As I was standing watch on the hill, I looked toward Birnam, and I thought I saw the forest begin to move.	modern
I didn’t write about breaking the alliance with Antony until I saw you were being misled and realized how dangerous it would be to keep postponing preparations.	modern
As you please.	modern
Why, sir, I trust I may have leave to speak, And speak I will.	shakespearean
Is it not strange, Canidius, That from Tarentum and Brundusium He could so quickly cut the Ionian sea And take in Toryne?—You have heard on ’t, sweet?	shakespearean
The cry is still “They come!” Our castle’s strength Will laugh a siege to scorn.	shakespearean
The villain won’t escape.	modern
What harmony is this?	shakespearean
She will taste as like this as a crab does to a crab.	shakespearean
Leave me with haste.	shakespearean
Why, I have eat none yet.	shakespearean
This strong poison’s overpowering me.	modern
Faith, sir, you need not fear.	shakespearean
Now go to the door and stay there until I call for you.	modern
There’s my dagger  Put away your dagger.	modern
Who, me?	modern
Don’t give it away.	modern
Ay, Celia, we stayed her for your sake.	shakespearean
At sea, I think.	shakespearean
He’s like a cowardly	modern
Bring me the handkerchief—My mind is full of doubt.	modern
Why then, good night indeed.	shakespearean
You call yourself my wife, yet you don’t call me “husband”?	modern
Yet if thou say Antony lives, is well, Or friends with Caesar, or not captive to him, I’ll set thee in a shower of gold and hail Rich pearls upon thee.	shakespearean
Did you call for me, your Worship?	modern
Tis a good silling, I warrant you, or I will change it.	shakespearean
What players are they?	shakespearean
His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge.	shakespearean
I want my bond, so stop talking.	modern
A faithful shepherd worships you.	modern
I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose— Help me away, dear Charmian!	shakespearean
Now that I think about it, I really want it.	modern
What’s that?	modern
At this hour Lie at my mercy all mine enemies.	shakespearean
I can’t hide what I am.	modern
Be calm!	modern
Tis a day Such as the day is when the sun is hid.	shakespearean
He is indeed worthy of the name “horse,” and you can call all the rest beasts.	modern
I am so much a fool, should I stay longer It would be my disgrace and your discomfort.	shakespearean
Well, then, here it is: you must prepare yourself for his knife.	modern
That ever holds.	shakespearean
In the great hand of God I stand, and thence Against the undivulged pretense I fight Of treasonous malice.	shakespearean
I never heard so loud a voice issue from such an empty heart.	modern
Those trumpets are calling us in to dinner.	modern
Would I dare do something like that?	modern
He’s had a ship wrecked coming from Tripolis.	modern
They’ll have me whipped for speaking true, thou'lt have me whipped for lying, and sometimes I am whipped for holding my peace.	shakespearean
Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself.	shakespearean
Never so rich a gem Was set in worse than gold.	shakespearean
Sleep a little.	shakespearean
Seal then, and all is done.— Eros!—I come, my Queen.—Eros!—Stay for me.	shakespearean
Everything’s fine, now, sweetheart.	modern
He’s friends with Caesar, In state of health, thou say’st, and, thou say’st, free.	shakespearean
Then if we lose this battle, you’ll be willing to be led in chains through the streets of Rome?	modern
Sir, these accusations should be answered.	modern
That thing you speak of, I took it for a man.	shakespearean
The foe vaunts in the field.	shakespearean
I am doubtful that you have been conjunct And bosomed with her as far as we call hers.	shakespearean
Let Rome fall!	modern
His courage is hidden, and when it is revealed, it will shrink.	modern
I’ll in to counsel them.	shakespearean
Thereby shall we shadow The numbers of our host and make discovery Err in report of us.	shakespearean
Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?	shakespearean
The devil himself could not pronounce a title More hateful to mine ear.	shakespearean
Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am but, as you would say, a cobbler.	shakespearean
Many good morrows to my noble lord.	shakespearean
But don’t I have good reason to cry?	modern
I assure my good liege, I hold my duty as I hold my soul, Both to my God and to my gracious king.	shakespearean
Here is the man.	shakespearean
Yes, of course.	modern
Prince Dauphin, you’ll stay with me in Rouen.	modern
I want to speak with Clarence, and I came here on my legs.	modern
You are early stirring.	shakespearean
My gracious lord, I should tell you what I saw, but I don’t know how to say it.	modern
A virtuous woman won’t give her husband horns, and my Rosalind is definitely virtuous.	modern
Your wives, your daughters, your old women, and your young maids together could not satisfy my lust.	modern
Upon the corner of the moon There hangs a vap'rous drop profound.	shakespearean
A dire induction am I witness to, And will to France, hoping the consequence Will prove as bitter, black, and tragical.	shakespearean
All blessed secrets, All you unpublished virtues of the earth, Spring with my tears.	shakespearean
My mistress Titania is in love with a monster.	modern
I didn’t like the way a particular courtier had cut his beard.	modern
Therefore I took your hands, but was indeed Swayed from the point by looking down on Caesar.	shakespearean
Follow me not.	shakespearean
Am not I Christopher Sly, old Sly’s son of Burton Heath, by birth a peddler, by education a cardmaker, by transmutation a bearherd, and now by present profession a tinker?	shakespearean
Why, he is the Prince’s jester, a very dull fool, only his gift is in devising impossible slanders.	shakespearean
If you deny me, fie upon your law— There is no force in the decrees of Venice.	shakespearean
Let it alone, thou fool.	shakespearean
So much for him.	shakespearean
Let’s see, how can I	modern
I’ll beat him despite his fancy fencing techniques and all the practicing he does, despite his youth and manliness.	modern
Madam, I trust, not so.	shakespearean
Me, “greedy”!	modern
The noise they make Will cause Demetrius to awake.	shakespearean
I know she trusts you and tells you everything.	modern
Let that be left Which leaves itself.	shakespearean
The world’s a huge thing.	shakespearean
Take good care of him.	modern
But  Hello, my lord, how have you been doing lately?	modern
But ships are just fragile boards, and sailors are just men.	modern
They probably received warning about how much I stirred up the people.	modern
Ay, but these English are shrewdly out of beef.	shakespearean
With his own bolt;     the strong-based promontory Have I made shake, and by the spurs plucked up The pine and cedar; graves at my command Have waked their sleepers, oped, and let 'em forth By my so potent art.	shakespearean
Fathers commonly Do get their children.	shakespearean
What enterprise, Popillius?	shakespearean
Men should be what they seem, Or those that be not, would they might seem none!	shakespearean
Go to, charm your tongue.	shakespearean
The trick of that voice I do well remember.	shakespearean
I do begin to have bloody thoughts.	shakespearean
Oh, bloody period!	shakespearean
Why doth the Jew pause?	shakespearean
They have made him drink alms-drink.	shakespearean
Alack, why thus?	shakespearean
Come, there is sauce for it.	shakespearean
It’s a skull with a scroll in its empty eye socket.	modern
So delicate with her needle, an admirable musician.	shakespearean
Why, madam, have I offered you my love only to be flouted in front of the king?	modern
Her dotage now I do begin to pity.	shakespearean
You call that ranting?	modern
Caesar, I have news about Menecrates and Menas, notorious pirates who prowl the sea in a variety of ships.	modern
Yes, I’ve been responsible for his upbringing.	modern
Is this your good friend who’s in so much trouble?	modern
I know the man well.	modern
Yet he seems capable.	modern
Let it work, For ’tis the sport to have the engineer Hoist with his own petard.	shakespearean
Think about our situation, then die.	modern
The mighty dukes, Gloucester and Buckingham.	shakespearean
He hath neither Latin, French, nor Italian, and you will come into the court and swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English.	shakespearean
Otherwise, I’ll die a virgin, devoted to you.	modern
Mistress, how mean you that?	shakespearean
Wake up, I say!	modern
Thy half o' th' kingdom hast thou not forgot, Wherein I thee endowed.	shakespearean
Did he ask for me?	shakespearean
Oh, she’s a fine woman!	modern
Now, by the world— It’s full of your ugly wrongdoings.	modern
Now go we in content To liberty, and not to banishment.	shakespearean
I cannot tell; I think not.	shakespearean
And you yourself will determine the sentence as you see fit, and impose the death penalty if you choose to, even if the criminal were my own son.	modern
There are reasons and causes why and how in everything.	modern
No, I’m not wound up.	modern
I’ll go look for him—Cassio, stay around here.	modern
He’s in Athens, my lord.	modern
I must perforce Have shown to thee such a declining day, Or look on thine.	shakespearean
Pardon, master.	shakespearean
But sure the bravery of his grief did put me Into a towering passion.	shakespearean
Go, and bring them.	shakespearean
Show ’s the way, sir.	shakespearean
Macbeth is ripe for the picking.	modern
It looks like you’ve offended it.	modern
I found it in my room, and Iago just confessed that he put it there for his own purposes.	modern
Sister, have comfort.	shakespearean
Put out the light, and then put out the light.	shakespearean
It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard discourse, my lord.	shakespearean
And came I not at last to comfort you?	shakespearean
God bless you for being here.	modern
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, But here I am to speak what I do know.	shakespearean
Let me see Philostrate.	modern
Who’s that?	modern
He did command me to call timely on him.	shakespearean
Then both, or one, or anything thou wilt.	shakespearean
Bring her to try wi' th' main course.	shakespearean
Once more remove, good friends.	shakespearean
Your Grace, we think, should soonest know his mind.	shakespearean
Give me an aphrodisiac, pharmacist.	modern
So you’re the only one who could play Pyramus.	modern
They mean to warn us at Philippi here, Answering before we do demand of them.	shakespearean
I will catch up with you, Cleopatra, and weep for your forgiveness.	modern
Why, fare thee well, King.	shakespearean
I would entreat you rather to put on Your boldest suit of mirth, for we have friends That purpose merriment.	shakespearean
I prithee, hear me speak.	shakespearean
And then, sir, does he this, he does— What was I about to say?	shakespearean
Fore heaven, an excellent song.	shakespearean
Oh yes, my lord.	shakespearean
Do you doubt that?	shakespearean
Then to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands.	shakespearean
Of anything the image tell me that Hath kept with thy remembrance.	shakespearean
Hurry to a convent.	modern
Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman?	shakespearean
If he’s as good as a saint but is black like a devil, I’d rather he hear my confession than marry me.	modern
If this business would really be finished when I did the deed, then it would be best to get it over with quickly.	modern
Why, so did you.	modern
Peradventure, to make it the more gracious, I shall sing it at her death.	shakespearean
He sups tonight with a harlotry, and thither will I go to him.	shakespearean
For various reasons that must remain secret, please do this for me.	modern
Now will I go to take some privy order To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight, And to give order that no manner of person Have any time recourse unto the princes.	shakespearean
I swear I’m not lying.	modern
I’ll catch it ere it come to ground.	shakespearean
Ay, it stands so that I may hardly tarry so long.	shakespearean
If I ever see it, I will challenge you.	modern
It is concluded.	shakespearean
Your fall has left a blot that opens even the best and brightest to suspicion.	modern
No, it wasn’t.	modern
What can you do but be happy?	modern
Where’s your servant	modern
Okay, now it starts!	modern
Here’s a night pities neither wise man nor fool.	shakespearean
Then shall we find tomorrow they have only stomachs to eat and none to fight.	shakespearean
Will you be crowned tomorrow?	modern
Oh, what a sad sight!	modern
O horror, horror, horror!	shakespearean
So swift a pace hath thought that even now You may imagine him upon Blackheath, Where that his lords desire him to have borne His bruisèd helmet and his bended sword Before him through the city.	shakespearean
I can’t pull a cart or eat dried oats like a horse.	modern
Oh, fie upon thee, strumpet!	shakespearean
Was that him just now?	modern
You know tomorrow is her wedding day.	modern
If not, it’s true, this parting was well done.	modern
Good name in man and woman, dear my lord, Is the immediate jewel of their souls.	shakespearean
No, I went round to work, And my young mistress thus I did bespeak: “Lord Hamlet is a prince out of thy star.	shakespearean
You won’t find any cause for anxiety, even if you look for one.	modern
You tell us the manner of the wrestling.	shakespearean
Know you what Caesar means to do with me?	shakespearean
You should mock me    I wish I were invisible, so I could grab that strong fellow by the leg.	modern
That “sort” was well fished for.	shakespearean
Why, that he did—I know not what he did.	shakespearean
And let no man abide this deed But we the doers.	shakespearean
I’ve had news that my Nell died of the pox in a hospice.	modern
Why then, to thee, thou silver treasure house.	shakespearean
And I would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard heart, for truly I love none.	shakespearean
It is almost morning, And yet I am sure you are not satisfied Of these events at full.	shakespearean
Then you told a lie, a sick, wicked lie.	modern
Once I’ve put my rackets to these balls, I’ll play a set in France, God willing, that will knock his father’s crown right out of the court.	modern
I do beseech your Grace pardon me, Who, earnest in the service of my God, Deferred the visitation of my friends.	shakespearean
The world is grown so bad That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch.	shakespearean
I repeat, he’s in love.	modern
We meant to tell the king that his orders have been carried out, and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.	modern
Please forgive me as I forgive you, Hamlet.	modern
I am a spirit of no common rate.	shakespearean
How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags?	shakespearean
Yes, very much like a whale.	modern
And mine say two hundred.	modern
Yes, my lord.	modern
On my honor and by my word, if you outstay the ten days, you will die.	modern
Yes, my master.	modern
Here’s a goat for you.	modern
I have a letter guessingly set down, Which came from one that’s of a neutral heart, And not from one opposed.	shakespearean
Is the army without a leader?	modern
In our case, our bad neighbors over their make us early risers, a healthy and sensible thing to be.	modern
Out on thee, seeming!	shakespearean
If she won’t tell Benedick, someone else should.	modern
I stumbled when I saw.	shakespearean
Oh, you  If you want to praise Caesar, just say his name—that’s all the praise that’s necessary.	modern
I’ll have Herod’s head chopped off!	modern
How dare you serve it to me this way!	modern
Obey you, love you, and most honor you.	shakespearean
Your Emperor Continues still a Jove.	shakespearean
If a man’s brain were in his feet, wouldn’t it be susceptible to frostbite?	modern
So I am—to let him live.	shakespearean
How now!	shakespearean
I beg your pardon.	modern
How is my generous sister?	modern
Nor is it up to you, my lord.	modern
Even though I’m mad, I won’t bite him.	modern
Isn’t it possible to imagine that the noble ashes of Alexander the Great could end up plugging a hole in a barrel?	modern
What, I will be jovial.	shakespearean
How dangerous to have this madman on the loose!	modern
With meditating that she must die once, I have the patience to endure it now.	shakespearean
Come hither, Catesby.	shakespearean
I can tell that something wicked is coming by the tingling in my thumbs.	modern
I am a Jew.	shakespearean
Stay with us.	shakespearean
I know thee not.	shakespearean
What’s new with you?	modern
And I do believe your Majesty takes no scorn to wear the leek upon Saint Tavy’s day.	shakespearean
No, it was a little one, not more than a pint.	modern
Indeed I do, sir, and I’ve come to let you in on a certain problem.	modern
Your Brutus ordered me to give it to you, and I’ll do what he says.	modern
Now let it work.	shakespearean
Wilt thou, Strato?	shakespearean
If only that were all it is— It is, I promise.	modern
Oh, what a mean low-life I am!	modern
Sir, here’s the door.	shakespearean
Go ahead and ask her.	modern
O insupportable and touching loss!	shakespearean
Let’s go.	modern
That’s the way a good deed shines in a naughty world.	modern
I’ve practiced Stoicism with as much devotion as you, but I still couldn’t bear this news like you do.	modern
Sadness is only appropriate for funerals.	modern
As a friend.	shakespearean
Skip over all the particularities between then and Harry’s return to France.	modern
In such a night as this!	shakespearean
Yes, ma'am.	modern
What do you think, Norfolk?	modern
I’ll scalp you.	modern
Here I go.	modern
Though I expect she’ll wear me out more quickly than I’ll wear out what I’m wearing—which will be good for her and even better for me!	modern
And therefore, I pray thee, news.	shakespearean
I’ve transferred Richard’s body to a new grave and on it poured more tears of remorse than it has shed drops of blood.	modern
If that is not granted, he reduces his requests and asks only that he be allowed to live as a private man in Athens.	modern
Tell thou the tale!	shakespearean
Yea, my lord.	shakespearean
Such as she says my lord did say I was.	shakespearean
Here, Fluellen, wear thou this favor for me and stick it in thy cap.	shakespearean
She’s full of good advice.	modern
You must go to Parthia.	modern
You’re going to rest while you’re still damned?	modern
Thou art come to answer A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch Uncapable of pity, void and empty From any dram of mercy.	shakespearean
You should be ruled and led By some discretion that discerns your state Better than you yourself.	shakespearean
And she is very smart.	modern
Two of both kinds make up four.	shakespearean
Since you’re giving me new assignments, let me remind you what you promised me but haven’t come through with yet.	modern
The duke my father loved his father dearly.	shakespearean
My liege, this man is a villain and a traitor, who—see, your Grace—has struck the glove which your Majesty took from Alençon’s helmet.	modern
He should, for that, commit your godfathers.	shakespearean
I pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them ill- favoredly.	shakespearean
Please tell me, who is this man?	modern
Please go, sir.	modern
Is this the monument of Leonato?	shakespearean
Come, lady; you must die in order to live.	modern
Tell me to tear up this contract.	modern
When I opened my eyes, I saw their swords out.	modern
Goneril, are you coming with us?	modern
I said thou hadst a fine wit.	shakespearean
And has anyone ever won her, as I’ve done?	modern
Our business now is mourning and grief.	modern
And just in time, here he comes with Sir Richard Ratcliffe.	modern
O most false love!	shakespearean
My parts, my title, and my perfect soul Shall manifest me rightly.	shakespearean
They’re in the heat of passion; they simply have to be together.	modern
Why, why is this?	shakespearean
Come, shall we fall to work?	shakespearean
Marry, your manhood, mew!	shakespearean
Farewell to you.—And you.—And you, Volumnius.	shakespearean
Base is the slave that pays.	shakespearean
I’ll fix you, I swear.	modern
Let me see 'em.	shakespearean
What quality is that, my lord?	modern
All is the fear and nothing is the love, As little is the wisdom, where the flight So runs against all reason.	shakespearean
You do love my lord.	shakespearean
Three thousand ducats for three months, and Antonio bound.	shakespearean
But since,  To get back to the matter at hand, what do you think of our proposal?	modern
Ay, my lord.	shakespearean
I’m sorry about your daughter’s death, but I swear our accusations were true, and backed up with proof.	modern
No, girl!	modern
Lucentio is your name.	shakespearean
Heaven knows you’re as unfaithful as hell.	modern
Where is thy luster now?	shakespearean
That your interest payments are like Jacob’s sheep?	modern
And so do I.	shakespearean
See it done And feast the army.	shakespearean
God knows why, but your mother and your brother have taken sanctuary in Westminster Abbey.	modern
That’ll be fine.	modern
There’s more depends on this than on the value.	shakespearean
It is well.	shakespearean
This was a merry message.	shakespearean
I’m glad about that.	modern
Then God be praised, it  Petruchio, do whatever you like.	modern
Yes, a dozen of them—as many as there are women in the world, in fact.	modern
Do you dare kill a friend of mine?	modern
When, without stratagem, But in plain shock and even play of battle, Was ever known so great and little loss On one part and on th' other?	shakespearean
I beg the court to deliver the verdict.	modern
Then, good my lord, teach your cousin to consent winking.	shakespearean
There are the players.	shakespearean
And, make no mistake, you’ll find, as we his subjects have, an amazing difference between the king as a young man and the way he is now.	modern
The death of my father, my physical weakness, the loss of all my friends, the threats of this man who’s taken me prisoner—all that would be easy for me to take, if only I could look through my prison windows once a day and see this girl.	modern
I’m not as happy as I seem.	modern
Give me my robe, for I will go.	shakespearean
But thou must needs be sure My spirits and my place have in their power To make this bitter to thee.	shakespearean
Nay, you need not fear us, Lorenzo.	shakespearean
You would be satisfied?	shakespearean
Hang thou there upon the tomb, Praising her when I am dumb.	shakespearean
O Lord, methought what pain it was to drown, What dreadful noise of waters in my ears, What sights of ugly death within my eyes.	shakespearean
Where have you hid yourself?	shakespearean
Do you lie so low?	modern
Listening to their frightened voices, I couldn’t reply “Amen” when they said “God bless us!” Don’t think about it so much.	modern
When you see leeks in the future, I hope you keep mocking them.	modern
I do remember now.	shakespearean
He thanks you on his knees many times and considers himself fortunate to have fallen into the hands of one, as he thinks, who is the bravest, most valorous, and thrice-worthy gentleman of England.	modern
On such a full sea are we now afloat, And we must take the current when it serves Or lose our ventures.	shakespearean
Antonio’s a good man.	modern
So, take me, death!	modern
We understand you’re just doing it for us, and we’ll be sure to say so.	modern
Out, loathèd medicine!	shakespearean
Where we are, There’s daggers in men’s smiles.	shakespearean
Dat it not be de custom pour les ladies of France—I cannot tell vat is  To kiss.	modern
No, not at all.	modern
Madam, withdraw: the Prince, the Count, Signor Benedick, Don John, and all the gallants of the town are come to fetch you to church.	shakespearean
Call not your stocks for me.	shakespearean
For I am sure, Though you can guess what temperance should be, You know not what it is.	shakespearean
I stand here with the law on my side.	modern
I think he be transformed into a beast, For I can nowhere find him like a man.	shakespearean
Tell me.	modern
And, gentle Puck, take this transformed ass’s head off of the head of that Athenian man, so that when he wakes up at the same time as the rest of them do, they can all go back to Athens.	modern
But, by your favor, how near’s the other army?	shakespearean
Then, rejecting my request, you kill	modern
Tell us what happened today that put Caesar in such a serious mood.	modern
And yonder, Caesar.	shakespearean
Well, again.	shakespearean
Lord, how you’ve changed!	modern
I’ll never see ’t!	shakespearean
Well, do whatever you think best.	modern
For my part, I had rather bear with you than bear you.	shakespearean
So beware of my contempt, and keep your promise.	modern
And neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn, Like horse, hound, hog, bear, fire, at every turn.	shakespearean
I’ll die  You’re of royal blood, and we obey you.	modern
O, unpleasing news!	shakespearean
And when I’ve sneaked up on my sons-in-law, then I’ll kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!	modern
I scorn you not.	shakespearean
Those who were bitter enemies of your father in his time have turned their bitterness to sweetness, serving you loyally and wholeheartedly.	modern
It is now two o'clock.	shakespearean
Who will advance with me?	modern
Help, my lord of Norfolk, help, help!	modern
I pray you, then, in love and dear alliance, Let that one article rank with the rest, And thereupon give me your daughter.	shakespearean
What might you think?	shakespearean
In wisdom I should ask thy name.	shakespearean
of patience.	modern
Didst thou give all to thy two daughters, and art thou come to this?	shakespearean
That’s the end.	shakespearean
Within my sword’s length set him; if he ’scape, Heaven forgive him too.	shakespearean
For the which I hear what they say of him.	shakespearean
Where am I?	modern
Someone who makes a promise and breaks it.	modern
Both which, Master Constable— You have.	shakespearean
I would be friends with you and have your love, Forget the shames that you have stained me with, Supply your present wants and take no doit Of usance for my moneys—and you’ll not hear me!	shakespearean
You do your job well.	modern
Age is the thing that nourishes.	modern
Actors can’t keep a secret.	modern
And what have I to give you back whose worth May counterpoise this rich and precious gift?	shakespearean
Who can say I’m evil when my advice is so good?	modern
Jailer, keep an eye on him.	modern
But this good comfort bring I to your Highness: The Breton navy is dispersed by tempest.	shakespearean
This man looks like his business is urgent.	modern
And as wise as a goose.	modern
Look, here comes our honored hostess!	modern
Ay, my good lord.	shakespearean
Who meets us here?	shakespearean
Why then, my cousin, Margaret, and Ursula Are much deceived, for they did swear you did.	shakespearean
See, who comes here?	shakespearean
He mixed that poison himself.	modern
My sweet mistress Weeps when she sees me work, and says such baseness Had never like executor.	shakespearean
That’s what’s clever about it.	modern
What makes him here?	shakespearean
He must be wearing this crazy outfit for some reason.	modern
My lord, I know not what the matter is, but to my judgment your highness is not entertained with that ceremonious affection as you were wont.	shakespearean
Ay, what else?	shakespearean
Say, “That splendid Antony.” The courageous Caesar!	modern
Go, good Tubal.	shakespearean
My soul doth tell me Hero is belied, And that shall Claudio know; so shall the Prince And all of them that thus dishonor her.	shakespearean
O come, Ventidius.	shakespearean
Very nice to see you, sir.	modern
Know, Claudio, to thy head, Thou hast so wronged mine innocent child and me That I am forced to lay my reverence by, And with gray hairs and bruise of many days Do challenge thee to trial of a man.	shakespearean
I am the duke That loved your father.	shakespearean
But note me, signor—	shakespearean
No one shows mercy because he has to.	modern
And so I said to my daughter: “Lord Hamlet is a prince, he’s out of your league.	modern
Humbly I thank your grace.	shakespearean
I want very much to find out.	modern
Bless us!	shakespearean
With all my heart, good youth.	shakespearean
Tis marvel, but that you are but newly come, You might have heard it else proclaimed about.	shakespearean
Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge, To stop his wounds lest he do bleed to death.	shakespearean
This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven Than thou wast worthy her.	shakespearean
Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier’s debt.	shakespearean
Fare you well.	shakespearean
What kind of loyalty is this?	modern
The patch is kind enough, but a huge feeder, Snail-slow in profit, and he sleeps by day More than the wildcat.	shakespearean
All the rest of the conspirators acted out of jealousy of great Caesar.	modern
If that’s what you say, go fight a duel with me and prove it.	modern
Did I, Charmian, Ever love Caesar so?	shakespearean
Daughters who can make you obey them.	modern
And now you claim you gave it to a judge’s clerk!	modern
He can’t be Fortune; he’s only Fortune’s errand boy.	modern
Let’s hear someone play the triangle and the sticks.	modern
Do you intend to stay with me tonight?	shakespearean
That were a kind of bastard hope indeed.	shakespearean
Quail, crush, conclude, and quell!	shakespearean
We’ll bury him, and then we’ll commit acts as brave and fine as any Romans, and make death proud to take us.	modern
I cannot speak to her, yet she urged conference.	shakespearean
Pull off my beard?	modern
No, I’m sure it has, Volumnius.	modern
What’s that?	modern
Yes—as you and the rest will find out as soon as he’s home.	modern
She did indeed.	shakespearean
Thou art armed, Gloucester.	shakespearean
What news?	shakespearean
Thus the bowl should run, And not unluckily against the bias.	shakespearean
And speak ’t again, my lord.	shakespearean
You were best go in.	shakespearean
Hey, look over there!	modern
Make your vaunting true, And it shall please me well.	shakespearean
I hope the king made peace with all of us; And the compact is firm and true in me.	shakespearean
But, my good lord, this boy is forest-born And hath been tutored in the rudiments Of many desperate studies by his uncle, Whom he reports to be a great magician Obscurèd in the circle of this forest.	shakespearean
No, I found it and gave it to my husband.	modern
Why, who would not make her husband a cuckold to make him a monarch?	shakespearean
Let’s have the evidence.	modern
Why, what i' devil’s name, tailor, call’st thou this?	shakespearean
If all the wine in my bottle will recover him, I will help his ague.	shakespearean
That’s not in her favor.	modern
Hot, hot and moist.	modern
I go.	shakespearean
Well, I will do it, though I take thee in the king’s company.	shakespearean
Not in my house, Lucentio.	modern
My talk to thee must be how Benedick Is sick in love with Beatrice.	shakespearean
The word is too good to represent her wickedness.	modern
I might as well go before the King of France, who took my youngest daughter without a dowry, kneel before his throne, and beg him to give me a tiny pension to stay alive.	modern
I seek no revenge for myself, but so dearly do I hold the safety of my kingdom, which you sought to destroy, that you must be punished according to her laws.	modern
Get out, you horrible poison.	modern
Why, this was molded on a porringer!	shakespearean
Silence, then!	modern
I will be more jealous of thee than a Barbary cock- pigeon over his hen, more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more newfangled than an ape, more giddy in my desires than a monkey.	shakespearean
But why aren’t you in your shop today?	modern
My countrymen—     Peace, silence!	shakespearean
It is not lost, but what and if it were?	shakespearean
He was not sad, for he would shine on those That make their looks by his.	shakespearean
Never was monarch better feared and loved Than is your Majesty.	shakespearean
You’d be king o' th' isle, sirrah?	shakespearean
Who keeps her company?	shakespearean
But, tell me, where is the noble Richmond now?	modern
I won’t.	modern
But I with blowing the fire shall warm myself.	shakespearean
Well, it’s not for me to say.	modern
Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our return.	shakespearean
You’re too bitter.	modern
He’ll accompany my wife, and bring whatever else you think I might need.	modern
Toward Peloponnesus are they fled.	shakespearean
Let’s do it with no show of anxiety—no, with no more fear than if we’d heard that the English were busying themselves with folk dancing.	modern
Do me no foul play, friends.	shakespearean
By such despair I should accuse myself.	shakespearean
I’ll take responsibility for that.	modern
Go ahead.	modern
A hundred marks, my Kate does put her down.	shakespearean
I admit that he’s murderous, lecherous, greedy, lying, deceitful, violent, malicious, and guilty of every sin that has a name.	modern
I will not trade my horse for any that walks on four legs.	modern
I agree.	modern
If your Grace would kindly appoint some members of your council to sit with me once more and go over them more carefully, I will give my answer and acceptance right away.	modern
And that were much he should, for he is given To sports, to wildness and much company.	shakespearean
What do you think of this plan?	modern
Now fear I this will give it start again.	shakespearean
I once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus: “Wonder of nature—”  I have heard a sonnet begin so to one’s mistress.	shakespearean
The sum of all I can, I have disclosed.	shakespearean
That very time I saw (but thou couldst not) Flying between the cold moon and the Earth, Cupid all armed.	shakespearean
Be by, good madam, when we do awake him.	shakespearean
Why, so I do.	shakespearean
That is the sum of all, Leonato.—Signior Claudio and Signior Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath invited you all.	shakespearean
When you’ve finished all this, return to the porch of Pompey’s theater, where you’ll find us.	modern
What is thy name?	shakespearean
Go you before, and I will follow you.	shakespearean
When devils will the blackest sins put on They do suggest at first with heavenly shows As I do now.	shakespearean
Why do you ask?	modern
I’ll ask him for my position back again, and he’ll tell me I’m a drunk.	modern
It may be, it certainly may be.	modern
He will come straight.	shakespearean
You wake up to have fun, and you start work when you go to bed.	modern
What rein can hold licentious wickedness When down the hill he holds his fierce career?	shakespearean
Now, you tell me: should I feel loyal to the Moor?	modern
Set it by a while.	shakespearean
If he’s not in love with a woman, then you can’t trust the usual symptoms.	modern
Now attest That those whom you called fathers did beget you.	shakespearean
Would she had never given you leave to come!	shakespearean
A prison like that would give me enough liberty.	modern
Know I these men that come along with you?	shakespearean
I’ll give you enough gold to pay back your debt twenty times over.	modern
I can’t put my feelings into verse, but please believe I love you best, oh, best of all.	modern
A woman owes her husband the same loyalty a subject owes his king.	modern
Wicked woman, these white hairs you’re pulling off my chin will come to life and accuse you of wrong-doing.	modern
Listen, my lords— We’re in a bit of a hurry, Leonato.	modern
Oh, it’s dreadful, dreadful, Iago!	modern
Get rid of half your knights and go back to spend the rest of your month with my sister.	modern
Nay, and most like.	shakespearean
Then slip I from her bum, down topples she, And “Tailor!” cries, and falls into a cough, And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh, And waxen in their mirth, and neeze, and swear A merrier hour was never wasted there.	shakespearean
Hamlet, you’re dead.	modern
I remember You did supplant your brother Prospero.	shakespearean
I will, in other words, kill you in three hundred and fifty ways.	modern
With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and prove an ass.	shakespearean
Lysander’s love, that would not let him bide, Fair Helena, who more engilds the night Than all yon fiery oes and eyes of light.	shakespearean
I am a king, my masters, know you that?	shakespearean
Though our lives— Your spirits shine through you.	shakespearean
Three months from twelve months of the year.	modern
Look with your ears.	modern
Where have you been hiding?	modern
Now, good sir, what are you?	shakespearean
If I were to make a prediction regarding this union, I wouldn’t say that.	modern
Let me tell	modern
No, to the Whitefriars monastery.	modern
Hold off the earth awhile Till I have caught her once more in mine arms.	shakespearean
Do you like pictures?	modern
Tell us.	modern
He’s of the color of the nutmeg.	shakespearean
Sinful Macduff, They were all struck for thee!	shakespearean
Strange and terrible events are all welcome, but I despise comforts.	modern
I told you not to hang around my house.	modern
I beg your pardon—I thought it was me whom you were calling all those terrible names.	modern
It was well done, and thou shalt sleep again.	shakespearean
Captain Macmorris, I beseech you now, will you voutsafe me, look you, a few disputations with you as partly touching or concerning the disciplines of the war, the Roman wars?	shakespearean
If she wants to be proud, or “honest,” as she calls it, she can just marry her own pride.	modern
Tell me, why did the king arrive with such a small entourage?	modern
So are you, princes English, every one.	shakespearean
The early village cock Hath twice done salutation to the morn.	shakespearean
I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to tear a cat in to make all split.	shakespearean
If you pay too much attention to him you’ll make him angry, and that will make his convulsions go on longer.	modern
Hortensio, good friends like us can get by on a few words.	modern
The rooster has already crowed twice.	modern
I speak not this that you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge, insomuch I say I know you are.	shakespearean
But I will tell you this very plainly: I have challenged Claudio, and either he’ll accept the challenge or admit he’s a coward.	modern
Farewell, everyone.	modern
Nor, I am sure, there is no force in eyes That can do hurt.	shakespearean
Here’s the east.	modern
We cannot call her winds and waters sighs and tears.	shakespearean
Birnam Wood.	modern
Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand That chambers will be safe.	shakespearean
Oh, Cassius, Brutus gave the orders too soon.	modern
The spring, the summer, The childing autumn, angry winter change Their wonted liveries, and the mazèd world, By their increase, now knows not which is which.	shakespearean
The mighty gods defend thee!	shakespearean
Methought their souls whose bodies Richard murdered Came to my tent and cried on victory.	shakespearean
Peace there!	shakespearean
When this burns, 'Twill weep for having wearied you.	shakespearean
My lord, for aught I know.	shakespearean
If Fulvia were the last woman on earth, there would be a reason to grieve.	modern

My lord, if you have a free moment, I have a message from His Majesty.	modern
Tell me anything you remember.	modern
Ask her to help you get back your position.	modern
He’s as ugly in his manners as he is in appearance.— I will indeed.	modern
I hope my noble lord esteems me honest.	shakespearean
Will no one back me up?	modern
I think he only loves the world for him.	shakespearean
Pluck up thy spirits.	shakespearean
What symptoms, my lord?	modern
I couldn’t see you, Lysander, but I heard your voice, and that’s how I found you.	modern
She is so generous, kind, and ready to help that she thinks it’s wrong not to do everything she can, even more than she is asked to do.	modern
Ambassadors of Harry, king of England, request a hearing with your Majesty.	modern
My little spirit, see, Sits in a foggy cloud and stays for me.	shakespearean
He was not three leagues off when I left him.	shakespearean
Go now, Lord Constable and all you princes, and quickly bring us news of England’s defeat.	modern

Did you talk with him?	modern
Katherine the curst!” A title for a maid of all titles the worst.	shakespearean
Is this the family tomb of Leonato?	modern
Tis safer to be that which we destroy Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.	shakespearean
My poor husband, my dear Edward!	modern
You are not wood, you are not stones, but men.	shakespearean

How now, friend Eros!	shakespearean
Caesar, thy thoughts Touch their effects in this.	shakespearean
No, no, with God’s help, his son will be king.	modern
Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice And could of men distinguish, her election Hath sealed thee for herself, for thou hast been— As one in suffering all that suffers nothing— A man that Fortune’s buffets and rewards Hast ta'en with equal thanks.	shakespearean

It is here, Hamlet.	shakespearean
Disrespected in my own house by a spool of thread!	modern
You’ve only insulted yourself.	modern
Damned Iago!	modern

Thou didst prevent me.	shakespearean
But in respect of that, I would fain think it were not.	shakespearean
See—I’ve sealed his fate with this mark next to his name.	modern
Keep thou the left.	shakespearean
It seems that the guards who were supposed to be protecting his chamber did it.	modern
What a heavy sigh!	modern
But step aside, fairy!	modern
This the Dauphin speaks.	shakespearean
There never was a monarch better feared and loved than yourself, your Majesty.	modern

Therefore thou sleep’st so sound.	shakespearean
God defend and guard us innocents against them!	modern

It blesses the one who gives it and the one who receives it.	modern
Lead them inside.	modern
Methought I had, and often did I strive To yield the ghost, but still the envious flood Stopped in my soul and would not let it forth To find the empty, vast, and wand'ring air, But smothered it within my panting bulk, Who almost burst to belch it in the sea.	shakespearean
Oh, you are men of stones.	shakespearean
Good Macbeth, we’re ready when you are.	modern
An I may hide my face, let me play Thisbe too!	shakespearean
Lunatics, lovers, and poets all are ruled by their overactive imaginations.	modern
I am afeard there are few die well that die in a battle, for how can they charitably dispose of anything, when blood is their argument?	shakespearean
If I could add a lie unto a fault I would deny it.	shakespearean
Oh, sir— Don’t think I’m flattering you.	modern
Then heaven have mercy on me!	modern
If we do meet again, we’ll smile indeed.	shakespearean
I like him not, nor stands it safe with us To let his madness range.	shakespearean
I’ll answer that.	shakespearean
I can’t believe my sister would neglect her obligations in any way.	modern
The sorrow that I feel actually belongs to you, and the high life you enjoy actually belongs to me.	modern
I think so.	modern
I will be bitter with him and passing short.	shakespearean
The one the Moor gave to Desdemona, which you asked me to steal so many times.	modern
justice will be rewarded.	modern
I’m telling you, it was Carthage.	modern
Yes, certainly.	modern
I have too grieved a heart To take a tedious leave.	shakespearean
But I guess it doesn’t matter.	modern
Things must be as they may.	shakespearean
If what you feel is really love, tell me how much.	modern
Don’t bother trying to intimidate me by putting your hand on your sword.	modern
The first interr'gatory That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is Whether till the next night she had rather stay, Or go to bed now, being two hours to day.	shakespearean
Oh well, God’s in charge, and some people have to go to heaven, while other people have to go to hell.	modern
Yours, yours.	shakespearean
You have an excellent armor, but let my horse have his due.	shakespearean
You taught me first to beg, and now methinks You teach me how a beggar should be answered.	shakespearean
Yea, from the table of my memory I’ll wipe away all trivial fond records, All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past That youth and observation copied there, And thy commandment all alone shall live Within the book and volume of my brain, Unmixed with baser matter.	shakespearean
No, not at all.	modern
So said, so done, is well.	shakespearean
Intend a kind of zeal both to the Prince and Claudio, as in love of your brother’s honor, who hath made this match, and his friend’s reputation, who is thus like to be cozened with the semblance of a maid, that you have discovered thus.	shakespearean
When the vision passes, you’ll see that you’re just looking at a stool.	modern
I am his brother, and I love him very much.	modern
It’s very hot.	modern
Do my simple features please you?	modern
I’ll kill him!	modern
Being unprepared, Our will became the servant to defect, Which else should free have wrought.	shakespearean
And thus it may be.	shakespearean
You sell fish.	modern
I pray you do.	shakespearean
There could I have him now—and there—and there again—and there.	shakespearean
Saint Valentine is past.	shakespearean
Why, so did you.	modern
The devil damn thee black, thou cream-faced loon!	shakespearean
A third cannot be matched unless the devil himself turn Jew.	shakespearean
I found that handkerchief by accident and gave it to my husband.	modern
Now start the music, and sing the solemn hymn.	modern
So, of his gentleness, Knowing I loved my books, he furnished me From mine own library with volumes that I prize above my dukedom.	shakespearean
There is but one mind in all these men, and it is bent against Caesar.	shakespearean
What do you think I should do?	modern
My lord, you know I love you.	shakespearean
Do, do.	shakespearean
There’s enough.	shakespearean
He doesn’t have children.	modern
In pity of the challenger’s youth, I would fain dissuade him, but he will not be entreated.	shakespearean
Brutus, you give a nice speech along with your evil strokes.	modern
With a doctor’s help he might recover and become an ass again.	modern
He would never have spoken to me like this.	modern
I will not rise until your Highness hears me.	modern
Princes and counties!	shakespearean
Even so.—Cover their faces.	shakespearean
Is he not approved in the height a villain, that hath slandered, scorned, dishonored my kinswoman?	shakespearean
Both of you Know Banquo was your enemy.	shakespearean
What endeavor, Popillius?	modern
Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.	shakespearean
Or who pronounced The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death Before I be convict by course of law?	shakespearean
She’s weak and will die unless you comfort her.	modern
My brother thinks highly of you, and because of his affection, has helped arrange your marriage—but that was definitely a waste of his time and energy.	modern
Dost thou say so?	shakespearean
A contract of true love to celebrate, And some donation freely to estate On the blessed lovers.	shakespearean
You’re in the charge of an honorable man.	modern
Saw you anything?	shakespearean
Why, this that I speak of.	shakespearean
Call them again.	shakespearean
But excuse me,  Yes, I’m talking about Launcelot, sir.	modern
Why might not you, my lord, receive attendance From those that she calls servants, or from mine?	shakespearean
What you’re doing is the way to make her scorn you continually.	modern
We’ll go to the river.	modern
Yes, the state’s half can be reduced, but not Antonio’s.	modern
But if you have sex with her before the marriage ceremony takes place, the heavens will not bless your relationship, but will overwhelm you with hate, contempt, and discord, and will poison your marriage bed so that you both grow to loathe it.	modern
My father was no traitor.	shakespearean
Is there any cause in nature that makes these hard hearts?	shakespearean
If any such there be, heaven pardon him!	shakespearean
Now that he’s old, we can expect to have to deal not only with his old character flaws, which have turned into deep-rooted habits, but also with the uncontrollable crabbiness that comes with old age.	modern
I’ll make ground beef out of you.	modern
By Jupiter, if I were Antony, I wouldn’t shave my beard today.	modern
Look you, sad friends, The gods rebuke me, but it is tidings To wash the eyes of kings.	shakespearean
Here comes the king, the queen, and the noblemen of court.	modern
They are not ever jealous for the cause, But jealous for they’re jealous.	shakespearean
Throw some of them at me.	shakespearean
That’s why it’s better for wise men to trumpet their own virtues, like I do.	modern
Madam, I have a touch of your condition, Which cannot brook the accent of reproof.	shakespearean
Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony, who, though he had no hand in his death, shall receive the benefit of his dying—a place in the commonwealth—as which of you shall not?	shakespearean
I thought I had escaped from the Tower and was on a ship to France with my brother Richard, who persuaded me to leave my cabin and walk on deck with him.	modern
Good night, lieutenant, I must to the watch.	shakespearean
There I deny my land service.	shakespearean
Pinch my nose?	modern
You go pale, you stare, and you act in awe of the strange disturbance in the heavens.	modern
To vail the title, as her mother doth.	shakespearean
I saw her face as she walked with her brother and Mark Antony.	modern
We doubt not now But every rub is smoothèd on our way.	shakespearean
Go, rascals, go, and fetch my supper in.	shakespearean
Can you remember the time before you came to live in this shack?	modern
He’ll make a proper man.	shakespearean
I say “amen.”	shakespearean
Be quick about it.	modern
Four o'clock in the morning.	modern
Let’s follow him.	modern
You belong to her.	modern
This is the fool that lent out money gratis.	shakespearean
My quaint Ariel, Hark in thine ear.	shakespearean
How is ’t with you, my most fair Bianca?	shakespearean
I do not like your faults.	shakespearean
These child actors are now in fashion, and they’ve so overtaken the public theaters that society types hardly come at all, they’re so afraid of being mocked by the playwrights who write for the boys.	modern
Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?	shakespearean
Therefore is it most expedient for the wise, if Don Worm, his conscience, find no impediment to the contrary, to be the trumpet of his own virtues, as I am to myself.	shakespearean
But I’ll not chide thee.	shakespearean
The clock has chimed midnight.	modern
I’ve written to my sister telling her everything he’s said.	modern
Howe'er thou art a fiend, A woman’s shape doth shield thee.	shakespearean
Curse you!	modern
I would thou hadst told me of another father.	shakespearean
Sister, be happy in my unhappiness.—Sir, I will humbly obey you.	modern
Yes, monstrous, monstrous!	modern
Yes, if you want to help yourself.	modern
My dear Othello!	shakespearean
But let’s stop this drinking and get down to business.—God forgive our sins!—Gentlemen, let’s get down to business.	modern
Why, all these should be in the lanthorn, for all these are in the moon.—But silence!	shakespearean
Be quiet, boy, or you’ll lose your mind.	modern
My own flesh and blood rebels against me!	modern
Help to dress me, good coz, good Meg, good Ursula.	shakespearean
Everything is a sick joke.	modern
Now my spirit is going.	shakespearean
What infinite heart’s ease Must kings neglect that private men enjoy?	shakespearean
On a night like this!	modern
Out and alas, that was my lady’s voice.	shakespearean
Good countrymen, let me leave alone.	modern
Alas, and woe!	shakespearean
Please, Horatio, go with him.	modern
And our drunkenness does detract from our achievements, as great as they are, and lessens our reputations.	modern
She takes these signs for warnings and predictions of terrible evils to come, and, on her knee, she begged me to stay home today.	modern
Be kind and courteous to this gentleman.	shakespearean
Which of you has been complaining to the king that I don’t like them?	modern
O ye gods, Render me worthy of this noble wife!	shakespearean
O, then it moved her?	shakespearean
No, ’twas the vane on the house.	shakespearean
Hast thou drunk well?	shakespearean
I’ll be at your service.	modern
My heart’s too sad for long goodbyes.	modern
Our separation so abides and flies That thou, residing here, goes yet with me, And I, hence fleeting, here remain with thee.	shakespearean
But action speaks louder than words, so I’ll cut short these polite words.	modern
Well, you may fear too far.	shakespearean
Cleopatra, Do not abuse my master’s bounty by Th’ undoing of yourself.	shakespearean
Only Antony was at fault.	modern
Wasn’t he here?	modern
Alas, why would you heap all these responsibilities on me?	modern
Dost thou mean the crown?	shakespearean
Oh, the good gods!	shakespearean
Why do you say that?	modern
Sir, here’s the Queen.	modern
This song’s about my dead father.	modern
So I hope.	shakespearean
Cast on no water.	shakespearean
And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord, That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading, Or nicely charge your understanding soul With opening titles miscreate, whose right Suits not in native colors with the truth; For God doth know how many now in health Shall drop their blood in approbation	shakespearean
I will expect you.	shakespearean
For, my good liege, she is so idly kinged, Her scepter so fantastically borne By a vain, giddy, shallow, humorous youth, That fear attends her not.	shakespearean
Go with me To bless this twain that they may prosperous be, And honored in their issue.	shakespearean
Listen to what the tyrant says.	modern
I’ll give you such reasons for killing him that you’ll feel obliged to snuff him out.	modern
Well, she got away.	modern
Is this certain?	shakespearean
It’s his handwriting, my lord, but I hope he didn’t mean what he wrote.	modern
Therefore, dear Isis, do the right thing and give him the fortune he deserves.	modern
It was the day he overcame the Nervii warriors.	modern
Do not abuse me.	shakespearean
You have seen the cruel proof of this man’s strength.	modern
And I will give you some more.	modern
I know no ways to mince it in love, but directly to say, “I love you.” Then if you urge me farther than to say, “Do you, in faith?” I wear out my suit.	shakespearean
What say you, uncle?	shakespearean
But we won’t shift the scene to Southampton until Henry reappears.	modern
I am bound by oath, so please forgive me.	modern
Regret that your mouth betrayed your actions.	modern
Come you from old Bellario?	shakespearean
That’s another sin arising from your ignorance: you bring ewes and rams together and make your living by their copulation.	modern
I will resolve you herein presently.	shakespearean
Come, let us go.	shakespearean
Now please leave me alone.	modern
The general and his wife are talking of it, And she speaks for you stoutly.	shakespearean
I will hide me in the arbor.	shakespearean
I don’t remember.	modern
My dear master, My captain, and my emperor, let me say, Before I strike this bloody stroke, farewell.	shakespearean
I’ll be more jealous of you than a wild rooster over his hen; more noisy than a parrot chattering about the rain; more fond of new things than an ape; more giddy about getting what I want than a monkey.	modern
Who calls?	shakespearean
Follow me and receive ’t.	shakespearean
By the god Jupiter above, I swear “No.” By Jupiter’s wife Juno, I swear “Yes.” They wouldn’t dare.	modern
Go to your cabins and be quiet!	modern
Looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled?	shakespearean
Do thou for him stand.	shakespearean
That’s how sound a man you appeared.	modern
But never mind them—if Caesar had stabbed their mothers, they would’ve forgiven him.	modern
Isn’t he an honest man?	modern
Here comes Thisbe.	shakespearean
But for your husband, He is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows The fits o' th' season.	shakespearean
Only he acted from honesty and for the general good.	modern
I wish it were over.	modern
Dido was from Carthage, not Tunis.	modern
Was he not born of woman?	shakespearean
And that same vengeance doth He hurl on thee For false forswearing and for murder too.	shakespearean
Nay, I know not.	shakespearean
She speaks my language!	modern
Yea, sir, we hope.	shakespearean
It is no mean happiness, therefore, to be seated in the mean.	shakespearean
Come on, close the curtain, Nerissa.	modern
There’s no face more sincere than one washed in tears.	modern
What need one?	shakespearean
Upon what sickness?	shakespearean
Truly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful.	shakespearean
How far’st thou, soldier?	shakespearean
Come on, let’s go at it, Macduff, and damn the first man who cries, 'Stop!	modern
I would they were, that I might die at once, For now they kill me with a living death.	shakespearean
O good old man, how well in thee appears The constant service of the antique world, When service sweat for duty, not for meed.	shakespearean
You gave that handkerchief, the one I loved and gave to you, to Cassio.	modern
There’s still a bit of daylight in the sky.	modern
I was conceived by a woman, and I thank her very much for all her effort.	modern
Leave him to my wrath.—Edmund, go with my sister-in-law.	modern
We’ll start a fire.	modern
Look over your lines again.	modern
The woman who might have blocked you from all the murders you’ve committed by strangling you in her cursed womb.	modern
Mark it, nuncle.	shakespearean
Bloody, bawdy villain!	shakespearean
What, frighted with false fire?	shakespearean
A traveler.	shakespearean
What will I do, think’st thou?	shakespearean
Until recently, I was as unimportant to his affairs as the morning dew is to the wide ocean.	modern
How many times will Caesar bleed again in show, though he now lies at the base of Pompey’s statue, as worthless as dust!	modern
Let me endure your wrath, if ’t be not so.	shakespearean
If I can disguise my voice as well as my appearance, then I’ll be able to carry out my plan perfectly.	modern
Maybe the letter moved him, For, as I think, they do command him home, Deputing Cassio in his government.	shakespearean
He uses his folly like a stalking-horse, and under the presentation of that he shoots his wit.	shakespearean
Don’t speak of this again.	modern
What’s the news with you?	modern
Tomorrow, and then every day after that.	modern
What’s the matter, lady?	modern
I’m sure of that.	modern
My dear lord, if it was you who conquered her and took her virginity— I know what you’re about to say.	modern
O God!	shakespearean
That is done, sir.	shakespearean
Or wilt thou hunt?	shakespearean
Ay, madam.	shakespearean
I mean that my heart unto yours is knit So that but one heart we can make of it.	shakespearean
But in fact it doesn’t say much.	modern
If she rants, I’ll tell her that she sings as sweetly as a nightingale.	modern
These hands do lack nobility that they strike A meaner than myself, since I myself Have given myself the cause.	shakespearean
Is Antony or we in fault for this?	shakespearean
Yes, it’s true.	modern
You shall mark Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave That (doting on his own obsequious bondage) Wears out his time much like his master’s ass For naught but provender, and when he’s old, cashiered.	shakespearean
My lord, he doth deny to come.	shakespearean
I sent for Cassio to come talk with you.	modern
Peace, ho!	shakespearean
Dissolve, thick cloud, and rain, that I may say The gods themselves do weep!	shakespearean
Sir, it’s a troupe of actors who want to perform for your Lordship.	modern
Who’s there?	modern
You need to leave to take care of your own business.	modern
If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not As to thy friends, for when did friendship take A breed for barren metal of his friend?	shakespearean
Why did I ever have one?	modern
Cry the man mercy, love him, take his offer.	shakespearean
By his dress I can tell he’s my countryman, but I don’t recognize him.	modern
God, that song’s even better than the other one.	modern
Only too well.	modern
And let her speak of me before her father.	shakespearean
List, list, O, list!	shakespearean
Full oft ’tis seen, Our means secure us and our mere defects Prove our commodities.	shakespearean
He is fortifying his castle at Dunsinane with heavy defenses.	modern
Leave them alone, and do the murder first.	modern
Ha, what sayest thou?	shakespearean
I hear a knocking At the south entry.	shakespearean
Add defiance to all this and, by way of conclusion, tell him that he has betrayed the men who follow him, whose death sentence has been pronounced.” My king and master’s message delivered, my task is done.	modern
They have tied me to a stake.	shakespearean
Let the rain spray!	modern
I have used thee, Filth as thou art, with human care, and lodged thee In mine own cell till thou didst seek to violate The honor of my child.	shakespearean
Ay, and he’ll tame her.	shakespearean
These are nothing but jealous lies.	modern
And as surely as I am alive, I am a virgin.	modern
Ay, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing.	shakespearean
I think I hear the drums far away.	modern
Didn’t I use to have four or five women taking care of me?	modern
Now she’s gone forever.—Cordelia, Cordelia, stay a while.	modern
I will kill thee a hundred and fifty ways.	shakespearean
Let us not leave him out.	shakespearean
Not in this land shall he remain uncaught.	shakespearean
Will ’t please your Honor taste of these conserves?	shakespearean
Goodly Lord, what a wit-snapper are you!	shakespearean
And therefore ’tis called a sensible tale.	shakespearean
Why do you need twenty-five knights, or ten, or even five, when you’re staying in a house with a staff of double that at your service?	modern
What are you doing here?	modern
Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out In sharing that which you have pilled from me!	shakespearean
May your sword be victorious and everything you do succeed.	modern
I think it lacks of twelve.	shakespearean
O earth!	shakespearean
And is it physical To walk unbracèd and suck up the humors Of the dank morning?	shakespearean
Signor Lodovico?	modern
No, not for all of Venice.	modern
I’m not going to waste any more time with you.	modern
No, I’ll be patient.	modern
Should not upbraid our course.	shakespearean
But I would be loath to fall into my dreams again.	shakespearean
Your honor calls you hence.	shakespearean
Please remember, love.	modern
Damn him!	modern
Do not doubt, Cassio, But I will have my lord and you again As friendly as you were.	shakespearean
I ordered that the sleeves be cut out and sewed up again, and I’ll prove it in combat even if your little finger is armed with your thimble.	modern
Thank you, sir.	modern
It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.	shakespearean
God save the charitable organization!	modern
My husband is dead.	modern
We told him we wouldn’t even let him bury his men until he retreated to Saint Colme’s Inch and paid us ten thousand dollars.	modern
Trow you whither I am going?	shakespearean
We’ll meet again at nine in the morning.	modern
In that case, leave our cousin Katherine here with us.	modern
You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams.	shakespearean
There is more in it.—Cousin Ganymede.	shakespearean
It’s time to hide, wretched Margaret.	modern
I wish to God that the golden crown that I’ll have to wear were red-hot steel and burned me straight through to the brain!	modern
Upon a lie seven times removed.—Bear your body more seeming, Audrey.—As thus, sir: I did dislike the cut of a certain courtier’s beard.	shakespearean
You’d break a date with your beloved by a whole hour?	modern
My father’s dead, and his fortune is mine now.	modern
Methinks, mistress, you should have little reason for that.	shakespearean
Cassius, stand firm.	modern
As ’tis said, the bastard son of Gloucester.	shakespearean
You must awhile be patient.	shakespearean
That’s why they say love is a child.	modern
Make her sterile and dry up her womb so that no baby will ever come out of her body and honor her.	modern
What didst not like?	shakespearean
Now you sound like a man.	modern
In a half an hour he’ll be asleep.	modern
My powers are crescent, and my auguring hope Says it will come to th’ full.	shakespearean
Let me say “Amen” betimes, lest the devil cross my prayer, for here he comes in the likeness of a Jew.	shakespearean
Are you sitting around in this humiliation to amuse yourself?	modern
I’ve acted like such a villain!	modern
It’s a good tragedy, very well done.	modern
We’re lucky that Rome is rid of him.	modern
I pray to God he isn’t.	modern
Oh, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous.	modern
Poor Tom shall lead thee.	shakespearean
Now I must return to the wedding.	modern
Not I.	shakespearean
Demetrius, I will keep my word with thee.	shakespearean
Oh, who did this thing?	modern
But do not stain The even virtue of our enterprise, Nor th' insuppressive mettle of our spirits, To think that or our cause or our performance Did need an oath, when every drop of blood That every Roman bears—and nobly bears— Is guilty of a several bastardy If he do break the smallest particle Of any promise that hath passed from him.	shakespearean
I would speak with Clarence, and I came hither on my legs.	shakespearean
Do that, my friend.	modern
All right, I will.	modern
What’s going on?	modern
I’ll tell thee, Aliena, I cannot be out of the sight of Orlando.	shakespearean
If your vengeful heart can’t forgive me, here—take my sword and bury it in my heart so that my soul, which adores you, can be free.	modern
Yes, sir, but anger hath a privilege.	shakespearean
If he be perjured, see you now, his reputation is as arrant a villain and a Jack Sauce as ever his black shoe trod upon God’s ground and His earth, in my conscience, la.	shakespearean
I don’t think it would be wise to let Mark Antony, whom Caesar is so fond of, outlive Caesar.	modern
Not in the legions Of horrid hell can come a devil more damned In evils to top Macbeth.	shakespearean
Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.	shakespearean
Why, thy godhead laid apart, Warr’st thou with a woman’s heart?	shakespearean
What things are these, my lord Antonio?	shakespearean
Bassanio gave his ring to the judge who asked for it, and deserved it too.	modern
I hope Demetrius comes to love you as much as you love him!	modern
What do you say?	modern
Very well, ma'am.	modern
Where yond pine does stand I shall discover all.	shakespearean
I am glad thy father’s dead, Thy match was mortal to him, and pure grief Shore his old thread in twain.	shakespearean
On me, whose all not equals Edward’s moiety?	shakespearean
I will walk by.	shakespearean
No, you’ll see, four days will quickly turn into four nights.	modern
You talk like a child, but you’re very smart anyway.	modern
Are these our eyes?	modern
News, friends!	shakespearean
Alas, I am the mother of these griefs.	shakespearean
Biondello, what of that?	shakespearean
Seek it out.	shakespearean
Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore.	shakespearean
I’m coming.	modern
Which dreams indeed are ambition, for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.	shakespearean
That will never be.	shakespearean
Bid him bring his pen and inkhorn to the jail.	shakespearean
Doors, open up for whoever is knocking!	modern
Why “puppet”?—Oh, I see where this is going.	modern
Spake you of Caesar?	shakespearean
Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland, I arrest you for high treason.	modern
And yet, words are a good thing when the man speaking them is pleasant to listen to.	modern
Then meet me forthwith at the notary’s.	shakespearean
Save you, worthy general!	shakespearean
I would it might prove the end of his losses.	shakespearean
Ay, you would beg, Were you in my distress.	shakespearean
No, Lepidus, let him speak.	shakespearean
Would you rather hear these things from our mouths or from our master’s?	modern
I’m your neighbor and came courting first.	modern
The powerful dukes Gloucester and Buckingham.	modern
If Cleopatra heard you, you would be well punished for your audacity.	modern
What wood is this before us?	shakespearean
Good luck.	modern
I could rhyme like that for eight years in a row, excepting meal times and sleeping hours.	modern
I think it is.	shakespearean
I’ll put ’t in proof.	shakespearean
And let our hearts, as subtle masters do, Stir up their servants to an act of rage And after seem to chide 'em.	shakespearean
She swoons to see them bleed.	shakespearean
So Litio’s out of the picture.	modern
I’d rather lie in the Nile mud with flies laying their eggs in me, making me disgusting.	modern
Peace.—Who comes here?	shakespearean
Gertrude, don’t drink that.	modern
Me too, I swear.	modern
One criminal punishes another.	modern
Did heaven watch the slaughter and not send down any help?	modern
The Queen is coming.	modern
Tis not in the bond.	shakespearean
My Lord Constable, the armor that I saw in your tent tonight, are those stars or suns upon it?	shakespearean
I chose her when I could not ask my father For his advice, nor thought I had one.	shakespearean
That you do love me, I am nothing jealous.	shakespearean
She cannot be so much without true judgment, Having so swift and excellent a wit As she is prized to have, as to refuse So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick.	shakespearean
I’ll tell you at a better time.	modern
What’s going on, Horatio?	modern
I stay here on my bond.	shakespearean
How dost, my lord?	shakespearean
Cassio hath here been set on in the dark By Roderigo and fellows that are ’scaped.	shakespearean
Well, I won’t.	modern
I won’t deny him anything of mine, including my own body and my husband’s bed.	modern
Order them to move back.	modern
I don’t know.	modern
One last thing, and this is up to you.	modern
I’ve noticed that they always like to settle and mate where the air is the nicest.	modern
What a shameless jerk you are to pretend you don’t know me!	modern
Cannot my Lord Stanley sleep these tedious nights?	shakespearean
I’ll wait over here.	modern
I have performed Your pleasure and my promise.	shakespearean
Unless I’ve mistaken his battle flags, which I’m sure I haven’t, his regiment lies at least half a mile south of the king’s mighty army.	modern
I’ll rest.	shakespearean
Thou but rememberest me of mine own conception.	shakespearean
These growing feathers plucked from Caesar’s wing Will make him fly an ordinary pitch, Who else would soar above the view of men And keep us all in servile fearfulness.	shakespearean
Where are you from?	modern
That’s good, Lion!	modern
The business you began here needs you as well—especially the business with Cleopatra, which only you can attend to.	modern
I thank thee, good Tubal.	shakespearean
I invite you all aboard my ship.	modern
You know me well.	shakespearean
I haven’t seen him for two days.	modern
Give me,”      quoth I.	shakespearean
Let’s go offer up our lives	modern
Caesar sends greeting to the Queen of Egypt, And bids thee study on what fair demands Thou mean’st to have him grant thee.	shakespearean
Oh, that’s pathetic!	modern
All the East, Say thou, shall call her mistress.” So he nodded, And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed, Who neighed so high that what I would have spoke Was beastly dumbed by him.	shakespearean
They don’t want you to go out today.	modern
I’ll tell you this, Constable, my mistress has his own hair.	modern
How did you get better?	modern
Would you would bear your fortune like a man!	shakespearean
I did not.	shakespearean
You’re a lying, cowardly wretch.	modern
Cursed be I that did so!	shakespearean
I am sorry to find you thus.	shakespearean
What, Pindarus!	shakespearean
Return you to my sister.	shakespearean
The adventurous knight will wave around his sword and shield, the lover will be rewarded for his sighs, the crazy character can rant all he wants, the clown will make everybody laugh, and the lady character can say whatever’s on her mind, or I’ll stop the play.	modern
I’ll be right next to you.	modern
My sweet Cassio!	modern
Why then, the mustard without the beef.	shakespearean
Now, your gown?	modern
The Moor’s killed my mistress!	modern
Come on, I’ll fight you.	modern
But how long will her beautiful life last?	modern
Tis one Iago, ancient to the general.	shakespearean
Stones have been known to move, and trees to speak.	shakespearean
So tell them, Publius.	shakespearean
I will leave him.	shakespearean
Come, Katherine Queen of All, reveal your heart to me in broken English.	modern
God pardon them that are the cause thereof.	shakespearean
And we’ll leave together, like friends.	modern
Those who smile at it will soon be dead themselves.	modern
Oh my Christian ducats!	modern
The gods know— Oh, never has a queen been so betrayed as I have been.	modern
You lie.	modern
What is this passion that ties up my tongue?	modern
I’m telling you, it’s hers.	modern
I will tell you.	shakespearean
I swear on my life, which I take pretty seriously, even if I am a magician.	modern
In nothing am I changed But in my garments.	shakespearean
Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?	shakespearean
Hope with good cause is swift; it flies as fast as a swallow.	modern
The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant’s life, Who slew today a riotous gentleman Lately attendant on the duke of Norfolk.	shakespearean
And if he fails at that, he will find other ways to kill you.	modern
My lord, I will use them according to their desert.	shakespearean
What’s that paper you were reading?	modern
Edward’s unhappy sons do bid thee flourish.	shakespearean
No, Antony.	modern
Know you any, Hero?	shakespearean
But we can talk more about that tomorrow, when we’ll discuss matters of state that concern us both.	modern
Just one glass.	modern
The weather is fair.	modern
O, let me not be mad, not mad, sweet heaven!	shakespearean
Consider how young you are, and question your feelings.	modern
When in that moment so it came to pass, Titania waked and straightway loved an ass.	shakespearean
And, friends, disperse yourselves.	shakespearean
Katherine the shrew!” That’s the worst thing you can call a young woman.	modern
I will deal in poison with thee, or in bastinado, or in steel.	shakespearean
I’d rather be wooed by a snail.	modern
You will take little delight in it, I can tell you, there is such odds in the man.	shakespearean
She  I can guess her answer.	modern
It was the most ruthless massacre this country has ever been guilty of.	modern
He stays upon your will.	shakespearean
Saint Davy’s Day has passed.	modern
Is that so?	modern
Come on, show me the wound that my eyes have caused.	modern
What love could press Lysander from my side?	shakespearean
Last night she got no sleep, and she won’t get any tonight.	modern
Things that are past are done, with me.	shakespearean
What, Gertrude?	modern
He does hear me, and that makes me cry.	modern
They are.	shakespearean
Pray you, away.	shakespearean
Women are sex machines below the waist, though they’re chaste up above.	modern
Or as ’twere perfumed by a fen.	shakespearean
You’re on very good terms with the duke of Exeter.	modern
If I should take a displeasure against you, look you—  Thou wert but a lost monster.	shakespearean
Behold this man.	shakespearean
But yet, I say, If imputation and strong circumstances Which lead directly to the door of truth Will give you satisfaction, you may have ’t.	shakespearean
Ceres, most bounteous lady, thy rich leas Of wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats, and peas; Thy turfy mountains, where live nibbling sheep, And flat meads thatched with stover, them to keep; Thy banks with pionèd and twillèd brims,	shakespearean
A monster, a very monster in apparel, and not like a Christian footboy or a gentleman’s lackey.	shakespearean
Caesar wouldn’t take the crown.	modern
Or does he walk?	shakespearean
Cheerly, good Adam.	shakespearean
Oh, father, I’m taking care of your business.	modern
Is she shrill-tongued or low?	shakespearean
Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher.	shakespearean
Well, I am glad that all things sort so well.	shakespearean
We’ll get married at some point, Audrey.	modern
Damn my suspicious thoughts!	modern
No, fair princess.	shakespearean
You see, we’re not alone in our unhappiness.	modern
Here comes Baptista.	shakespearean
You are a royal one, and we obey you.	shakespearean
His taints and honors Waged equal with him.	shakespearean
This is it, for now.	modern
O Antony, Antony, Antony!	shakespearean
The muffled queen” is good.	modern
Certainly, sir, I can.	shakespearean
Minion, your dear lies dead, And your unblest fate hies.	shakespearean
If his fitness speaks, mine is ready, now or whensoever, provided I be so able as now.	shakespearean
I say my daughter is my flesh and blood.	shakespearean
No port is free, no place That guard and most unusual vigilance Does not attend my taking.	shakespearean
The fact that this summer bird, the house martin, builds his nests here proves how inviting the breezes are.	modern
O dear discretion, how his words are suited!	shakespearean
If our father were dead you’d receive half of his revenue forever, and you’d have my undying love,      Edgar.” Hmm, what’s this, a conspiracy?	modern
Did he not say my brother was fled?	shakespearean
There is no tarrying here.	shakespearean
Ere he do leave this grove, Thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love.	shakespearean
Why do you send so thick?	shakespearean
How many cowards whose hearts are all as false As stairs of sand wear yet upon their chins The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars, Who, inward searched, have livers white as milk, And these assume but valor’s excrement To render them redoubted.	shakespearean
More than anything else in the world, I love you, value you, and honor you.	modern
Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.	shakespearean
Thou shalt not die.	shakespearean
My lord!	modern
He looks calmer than he did before.	modern
How say you, then?	shakespearean
Our knocking has awaked him.	shakespearean
Well, thank God I’m cured!	modern
What’s your name?	modern
We’re near his room now.	modern
Great kings of France and England, I owe you both equal service and loyalty.	modern
toward his own father who loves him so completely.	modern
I’ll take responsibility for it.	modern
Oh, then belike she was old and gentle, and you rode, like a kern of Ireland, your French hose off and in your straight strossers.	shakespearean
Get out of my sight!	modern
The food that to him now is as luscious as locusts shall be to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida.	shakespearean
It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will.	shakespearean
Go back and tell your king I do not seek an encounter with him now but would be willing to march on to Calais without interference, for—to be honest, though it’s probably unwise to confess this to a powerful enemy who has the advantage—my men are considerably weakened by illness, my numbers reduced, and those few men I have almost no better than so many Frenchmen, though when they were in good form, I tell you, herald, I thought three Frenchmen walked on every pair of English legs.	modern
Thou art a fool.	shakespearean
She’s mine, and I’m giving her to Demetrius.	modern
Who comes with her?	shakespearean
No seconds?	shakespearean
Desist, and drink.	shakespearean
Strives in his little world of man to outscorn The to-and-fro–conflicting wind and rain.	shakespearean
Besides that, he says that two meetings are going to be held tomorrow, and something may be decided at one of them that may make you and him, who are at the other, sorry.	modern
Tis very grievous to be thought upon.	shakespearean
Don’t say that, Lysander.	modern
So, tell me, assuming I win your daughter’s love, what dowry would she bring to the marriage?	modern
No, the man who cannot extol the virtues of my horse from dawn to dusk is not particularly clever.	modern
For my part, I have walked about the streets, Submitting me unto the perilous night, And, thus unbracèd, Casca, as you see, Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone.	shakespearean
Yes sir, thank God.	modern
If I stay longer, I’ll embarrass you and disgrace myself by crying.	modern
What will hap more tonight, safe ’scape the king!	shakespearean
She told my mother that as long as she kept it with her, my father would love and desire her.	modern
I do not, till you practice them on me.	shakespearean
I do too, my lord.	modern
He’ll never agree to that.	modern
Tell him I would speak with him.	shakespearean
I did her wrong— Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell?	shakespearean
You cannot feed capons so.	shakespearean
Long live Theseus, our famous and respected duke!	modern
Wert thou not banishèd on pain of death?	shakespearean
My spirits are nimble.	shakespearean
There be fools alive, iwis, Silvered o'er—and so was this.	shakespearean
May God keep you well, sir.	modern
Didn’t they pass by you?	modern
It would make him curse the heavens and be damned to hell.	modern
You see me standing here, Lord Bassanio.	modern
It’s getting there.	modern
From now on this is what I’ll think of your love.	modern
Come, ask me to do anything for you.	modern
He is not yet arrived.	shakespearean
Yes, he did.	modern
And let the wise man run away.	modern
Who are they following?	modern
Let us go, For it is after midnight, and ere day We will awake him and be sure of him.	shakespearean
It’s bad news when a country is ruled by a child.	modern
No, my lord, it’s been four months.	modern
Ay, to the proof, as mountains are for winds, That shakes not, though they blow perpetually.	shakespearean
We will yet do well.	shakespearean
Monster, your fairy, which you say is a harmless fairy, has done little better than played the jack with us.	shakespearean
I thank thee for thy care and honest pains.	shakespearean
And as for his dreams, I’m surprised he’s so foolish as to trust the fantasies of a restless night.	modern
Hear the shrill whistle, which doth order give To sounds confused.	shakespearean
I cannot speak of this.	shakespearean
Look you, if you take the matter otherwise than is meant, Captain Macmorris, peradventure I shall think you do not use me with that affability as, in discretion, you ought to use me, look you, being as good a man as yourself, both in the disciplines of war and in the derivation of my birth and in other particularities.	shakespearean
If he loves Caesar, then he can only hurt himself—by grieving and dying for Caesar.	modern
The cold wind’s still blowing through the hawthorn tree.	modern
Live thou, I live.	shakespearean
Old fashions please me best.	shakespearean
That he hath not.	shakespearean
Tell us, Bottom.	modern
To her, my lord, Was I betrothed ere I saw Hermia.	shakespearean
In short, I’m not.	modern
How does my wife?	shakespearean
We have lost a major portion of the world through utter foolishness.	modern
That’s how you’ll talk about me when you’re in this mood.	modern
I shall, my lord.	shakespearean
You know what they say.	modern
Come, seek the conspirators.	shakespearean
May the good Lord keep me safe from all women like her!	modern
Whate'er thou art, for thy good caution, thanks.	shakespearean
Tis death to me to be at enmity; I hate it, and desire all good men’s love.	shakespearean
I’ll go get Beatrice for you, who can walk here by herself—she has legs.	modern
Once again you bring good news.	modern
You speak not as you think.	shakespearean
He doesn’t have any daughters, sir.	modern
Who are you, coming so fast in this quiet night?	modern
It’s born of my  A witty mother!	modern
Good fortune, worthy soldier, and farewell.	shakespearean
My lord, I take my leave.	shakespearean
I cannot speak your England.	modern
You’ll be my role model.	modern
Oh, make an end Of what I have begun!	shakespearean
But were I not the better part made mercy, I should not seek an absent argument Of my revenge, thou present.	shakespearean
Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.	shakespearean
Say, isn’t this the Latin master Cambio?	modern
Who are you?	modern
Sure, but don’t do it at full volume until there’s no danger in it.	modern
But don’t go.	modern
I have seen nothing.	shakespearean
For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale, Say what thou canst, I’ll go along with thee.	shakespearean
Oh, teach me how you look the way you do, and which tricks you used to make Demetrius fall in love with you.	modern
Gracious Queen, even Herod of Judea wouldn’t dare look at you unless you were in a good mood.	modern
Do you lie still?	modern
These are portents, but yet I hope, I hope They do not point on me.	shakespearean
Please let me go.	modern
Is ’t frailty that thus errs?	shakespearean
Adieu, good neighbor.	shakespearean
Get out of my sight!—I guess if she doesn’t love her father, then I’ll only have peace when I’m dead.—Call the King of France.	modern
Oh, here comes the storm again.	modern
Yea, art thou there?	shakespearean
I can stand well enough, and I can speak just fine.	modern
Will your grace command me any service to the world’s end?	shakespearean
What’s that noise?	modern
When I tell him he hates flatterers, he agrees, just at the moment when I’m flattering him the most.	modern
I will do any modest office, my lord, to help my cousin to a good husband.	shakespearean
I look down towards his feet, but that’s a fable.	shakespearean
Then patiently listen to my impatience.	modern
How now, old lad?	shakespearean
Good-bye, kind Charmian.	modern
Look to ’t.	shakespearean
Because they are not eight?	shakespearean
What a sigh is there!	shakespearean
Here on her breast There is a vent of blood, and something blown.	shakespearean
It used to be that when you knocked a man’s brains out he would just die, and that would be it.	modern
Your gentleness shall force More than your force move us to gentleness.	shakespearean
Go to.	shakespearean
I could drink hot blood and do such terrible deeds that people would tremble even in the daylight.	modern
Take some remembrance of us as a tribute, Not as a fee.	shakespearean
I’ll be back here with you by two o'clock.	modern
How say you, Signior Gremio?	shakespearean
I wish some god could help me choose!	modern
Why have you collapsed?	modern
You should tell Antonio what you hear—but don’t do it suddenly, because it might upset him.	modern
Why, so.	shakespearean
Bless you, master.	modern
Upon condition Publius shall not live, Who is your sister’s son, Mark Antony.	shakespearean
If you like, you can rest a while in my room.	modern
I’m here.	modern
You heard her say herself it was not I.	shakespearean
Would ’t had been done!	shakespearean
Ay, more.	shakespearean
I am indebted to you for your last sermon.	modern
I didn’t think you could even be so angry.	modern
And now, I pray you, sir— For still ’tis beating in my mind—your reason For raising this sea storm?	shakespearean
The harvest comes shortly after that.	modern
From there we’ll safely carry you to France and back, calming the waters of the Channel to provide you with a smooth voyage.	modern
The motions of his spirit are dull as night, And his affections dark as Erebus.	shakespearean
All that follow their noses are led by their eyes but blind men, and there’s not a nose among twenty but can smell him that’s stinking.	shakespearean
Tis much.—Servants, leave me and her alone.	shakespearean
Yes, yes, my lord.	modern
If you come slack of former services, You shall do well.	shakespearean
I leave a slimy bastard with you, your Worship, for you to punish and make an example of.	modern
Let them last forever.	modern
I’ve seen both of you fence.	modern
Just like the rabbit, who lives where she is born.	modern
I’ve heard about this indirectly, but I will send for him.	modern
Up in the air, crowned with the golden sun, Saw his heroical seed and smiled to see him Mangle the work of nature and deface The patterns that by God and by French fathers Had twenty years been made.	shakespearean
So the fool follows you.	modern
This is the brief of money, plate, and jewels I am possessed of.	shakespearean
Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes to get myself into more work.	shakespearean
Oh, that’s ominous!	modern
They burn for revenge.	modern
Along with this strange power, he also has the gift of prophecy and various other abilities.	modern
And now I’ll do ’t.	shakespearean
It is the cry of women, my good lord.	shakespearean
Tis not the first time you were overshot.	shakespearean
Lord Hamlet.— Please let him be all right!	modern
That was a humorous message.	modern
I should really leave right away.	modern
There is a cliff, whose high and bending head Looks fearfully in the confinèd deep.	shakespearean
With his mouth full of news.	shakespearean
No, go ahead and take my life.	modern
My master hath appointed me to go to Saint Luke’s to bid the priest be ready to come against you come with your appendix.	shakespearean
If a man do not erect in this age his own tomb ere he dies, he shall live no longer in monument than the bell rings and the widow weeps.	shakespearean
The British forces are on their way here.	modern
I’ve lost my name and title to a traitor.	modern
Here’s another jacket to say thanks.	modern
Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have Some patient leisure to excuse myself.	shakespearean
Tell me once more what you say.	modern
We’ll along ourselves, and meet them at Philippi.	shakespearean
He’ll stay as long as I say.	modern
I didn’t do anything wrong that I know of, unless it was a sin to defend myself when someone attacked me.	modern
He’s right over there.	modern
Ay, so I think.	shakespearean
I wis, your grandam had a worser match.	shakespearean
He’s dreaming.	modern
I don’t know what to say.	modern
Oh, Antony, don’t beg us to kill you.	modern
In himself he is.	shakespearean
He’s gone.	shakespearean
I thank you, sir.	shakespearean
Why had I one?	shakespearean
Try to get him to do that.	modern
Why are you chewing on your lower lip like that?	modern
Give me your hand, And let me all your fortunes understand.	shakespearean
And we, like friends, will straightway go together.	shakespearean
So please you, he is here at the door and importunes access to you.	shakespearean
That’s the beginning of the day we see, but I don’t think we’ll see the end of it.—Who goes there?	modern
What does the golden box say?	modern
I have no opinion about him.	modern
You strike my people, and your disordered rabble Make servants of their betters.	shakespearean
None, but your beauty.	shakespearean
If this be so, why blame you me to love you?	shakespearean
And that’s how I’ll turn her good intentions into a big trap to snag them all.	modern
Listen, listen!	modern
And look to have it yielded with all kindness.	shakespearean
If the devil had such a beautiful house as his body, then good things would fight to live in it.	modern
Hence, Lest that th' infection of his fortune take Like hold on thee.	shakespearean
Peace, Smulkin.	shakespearean
Everyone who can hear has heard about it.	modern
Thou old unhappy traitor, Briefly thyself remember.	shakespearean
I don’t trust you.	modern
How the moon sleeps with Endymion And would not be awaked.	shakespearean
Look, here come two noble animals, a man and a lion.	modern
This fake astonishment of yours is just like your other pranks.	modern
If only my prayers could inspire that kind of affection!	modern
But, Audrey, there is a youth here in the forest lays claim to you.	shakespearean
I’d rather go without the money.	modern
Let’s go to the king.	modern
And how does your content Tender your own good fortune?	shakespearean
It’s a nice hazy feeling, so give in to it.	modern
O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers.	shakespearean
You’re in trouble either way.	modern
Ingrateful fox, ’tis he.	shakespearean
Ay, my good lord.	shakespearean
It shall advantage more than do us wrong.	shakespearean
If I can fasten but one cup upon him, With that which he hath drunk tonight already, He’ll be as full of quarrel and offense As my young mistress' dog.	shakespearean
Hark, hark!	shakespearean
Why did he so?	shakespearean
An ’twere to me, I should be mad at it.	shakespearean
Calphurnia here, my wife, stays me at home.	shakespearean
What is the time o' th' day?	shakespearean
How looked he?	shakespearean
Well, should we hear some music?	modern
Well, get thee gone.	shakespearean
Let’s go.	modern
When they’re endangered, I save them.	modern
I’m amazed you’re still talking, Signior Benedick.	modern
Is that you, Iago?	modern
His death’s upon him, but not dead.	shakespearean
Be patient, because the prize I’m leading you to will make you forget how smelly you are now.	modern
Titinius' face is upward.	shakespearean
Master Constable, you’re going about this all wrong.	modern
We now are near his cell.	shakespearean
Very near, and approaching fast.	modern
Your old smock brings forth a new petticoat, and indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow.	shakespearean
I am not some fiend of hell: you can’t get rid of me with spells.	modern
My boon I make it that you know me not Till time and I think meet.	shakespearean
Why, here’s no crab, and therefore look not sour.	shakespearean
Most royal sir, Fleance is ’scaped.	shakespearean
I thank you, doctor.	shakespearean
On Tuesday noon, or night, or Wednesday morn.	shakespearean
Help, ho!	shakespearean
My man—monster is so drunk he can’t talk.	modern
The Dauphin, whom of succors we entreated, Returns us that his powers are yet not ready To raise so great a siege.	shakespearean
Is all things ready for the royal time?	shakespearean
What sayst thou?	shakespearean
Ah, my lord, this prince is nothing like Edward!	modern
Lead me to where you’re standing.	modern
Here’s France and Burgundy, my noble lord.	shakespearean
Even the fiercest wild animal has some touch of pity.	modern
Oh, sad day!	modern
My children would have enjoyed a better death if God had blessed you with a purer life.	modern
Congratulations, lady: you resemble a most honorable man.	modern
Where is my lovely bride?	modern
My sword and I will earn our place in history.	modern
This is the prophecy that the wizard	modern
By God, I order you to speak.	modern
The crows and choughs that wing the midway air Show scarce so gross as beetles.	shakespearean
I will here be with thee presently, and if I bring thee not something to eat, I will give thee leave to die.	shakespearean
What, does your wife say you can come home?	modern
Put on your nightgown.	modern
Tis worse than murder To do upon respect such violent outrage.	shakespearean
A marvelous witty fellow, I assure you, but I will go about with him.—Come you hither, sirrah, a word in your ear.	shakespearean
Romans, countrymen, and friends!	modern
He said the truth.	shakespearean
No, not till a hot January.	shakespearean
Shylock, do you hear?	shakespearean
O hard condition, Twin-born with greatness, subject to the breath Of every fool, whose sense no more can feel But his own wringing.	shakespearean
O, let her live, And I’ll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty, Slander myself as false to Edward’s bed, Throw over her the veil of infamy.	shakespearean
Ay, leeks is good.	shakespearean
What’s the noise?	shakespearean
Until then, think about the well-being of Rome.	modern
It’s better to act virtuously rather than vengefully.	modern
You are naught, you are naught.	shakespearean
You’re sure full of smooth answers.	modern
I do beseech you To understand my purposes aright.	shakespearean
Forgive me.	modern
In what, my dear lord?	shakespearean
Come, sirs.	shakespearean
If she convey Letters to Richmond, you shall answer it.	shakespearean
Or shall I think in silver she’s immured, Being ten times undervalued to tried gold?	shakespearean
What do you think Of marching to Philippi presently?	shakespearean
One of you go call the Jew into court here.	modern
My old bones are tired.	modern
Here’s to thy health.	shakespearean
Very well.	shakespearean
You are a counterfeit cowardly knave.	shakespearean
Good my lord, enter.	shakespearean
Say that they slack their duties	shakespearean
Nor I, assure thee, Regan.— Edmund, I hear that you have shown your father A childlike office.	shakespearean
Tis almost fairy time.	shakespearean
All right, we’ll have a prologue then.	modern
The lady protests too much, methinks.	shakespearean
Who’s coming?	modern
Yes, I swear.	modern
I grant I am a woman, but withal A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife.	shakespearean
About an hour for the ringing and fifteen minutes for the crying.	modern
It wouldn’t be right for me to tell you everything I’ve seen and heard.	modern
What are we going to do, Enobarbus?	modern
Go, good partner, go, get you to Francis Seacole.	shakespearean
What were those things?	modern
No epilogue, please.	modern
Sir, by your patience: if I heard you rightly, The duke hath put on a religious life And thrown into neglect the pompous court.	shakespearean
Draw up your powers.	shakespearean
A good laugh.	modern
Why, that’s the way To fool their preparation and to conquer Their most absurd intents.	shakespearean
Who’s his lieutenant, hear you?	shakespearean
Will you go hear this news, Signior?	shakespearean
Tis done already, and the messenger gone.	shakespearean
If he is too insistent, tell him that romance is like a dance: it has its own rhythm and timing.	modern
is ’t not perfect conscience To quit him with this arm?	shakespearean
Okay, now I’m dead.	modern
Hold, for your lives!	shakespearean
Who then shall blame His pestered senses to recoil and start, When all that is within him does condemn Itself for being there?	shakespearean
My learnèd lord, we pray you to proceed And justly and religiously unfold Why the law Salic that they have in France Or should or should not bar us in our claim.	shakespearean
But how would you praise a truly good woman, someone who had no reason to worry about what anyone said about her?	modern
Let me live here ever.	shakespearean
What’s the news, my good friends?	modern
Unfold it.	shakespearean
What do you say?	modern
We will be witnesses.	shakespearean
Never anger Made good guard for itself.	shakespearean
Now ’mongst this flock of drunkards Am I to put our Cassio in some action That may offend the isle.	shakespearean
You, as your business and desire shall point you— For every man has business and desire, Such as it is—and for my own poor part, Look you, I’ll go pray.	shakespearean
I ask that none of you leave, except myself, until Antony has finished.	modern
If they refuse to come, get physical—use a whip if you have to, but get them out here to their husbands.	modern
Mock not, Enobarbus.	shakespearean
The poor people died.	modern
And here’s a marvelous convenient place for our rehearsal.	shakespearean
Sleeping and waking, O, defend me still!	shakespearean
I might have saved her.	shakespearean
What’s the treasure, uncle?	modern
I found her adjusting the crown on her dead mistress.	modern
Now Antony has to leave her completely.	modern
Is ’t not Hortensio?	shakespearean

And if they don’t find charity there, they find it someplace else.	modern
I swear, I could do so much— Please, no more.	modern

Casca will tell us what’s the matter.	modern
Unfortunately, I love myself.	modern
What grows of it, no matter.	shakespearean
Barnardo has my place.	shakespearean
Prithee, do not turn me about.	shakespearean
I’m going on alone.	modern
How will we pass the time without some entertainment?	modern

And here am I, and wood within this wood, Because I cannot meet my Hermia.	shakespearean
I have the authority to dismiss this court, unless Bellario comes today.	modern
The messenger Came on my guard, and at thy tent is now Unloading of his mules.	shakespearean
Demetrius thinks not so.	shakespearean
I’m glad you’re insane enough to admit it in front of me.	modern
Go, get thee hence.	shakespearean
Tom will throw his head at them.—Avaunt, you curs!	shakespearean

It will be to your advantage, because I’ll leave our father’s house and all his property to you, while I live and die a shepherd here in the forest.	modern
But in loving me, you would love the friend of France, for I love France so much that I will not part with a single village of it.	modern

The poison is as sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle—Oh, Antony!—No, I’ll take you too.	modern
Hast thou no care of me?	shakespearean
Write from us to him.	shakespearean
All the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand.	shakespearean
Tis certain so, the Prince woos for himself.	shakespearean
The honor is sacred which he talks on now, Supposing that I lacked it.—But, on, Caesar.	shakespearean

Good day, Lieutenant Bardolph.	modern
I want to forget what I am.	modern

Keep an eye on Cinna.	modern
What have you got on your head?	modern
What if I’d said I saw him do something to hurt you?	modern

So am I purposed.	shakespearean

Oh, please, Prince Dauphin!	modern
O Dardanius!	shakespearean
They stay upon your patience.	shakespearean
Yawn, snore.	modern
Oh, well.	modern
We want to hear it, Antony.	modern
No watch?	shakespearean
A piece of him.	shakespearean
And to that end we wished your Lordship here T' avoid the censures of the carping world.	shakespearean

Much will be seen in that.	shakespearean
Briefness and fortune, work!— Brother, a word.	shakespearean
Wake up, wake up!	modern

Who does it gallop for?	modern
Ho, let the door be locked.	shakespearean
What’s his offense?	shakespearean
Though I said my name was Benedick, I heard this news with Claudio’s ears.	modern
This is Signor Antonio.	shakespearean
Oh bloody Richard!	modern
I took the hint and spoke to her.	modern
Meet me and Gratiano at his house in about an hour.	modern
Myself myself confound, Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours, Day, yield me not thy light, nor night thy rest, Be opposite all planets of good luck To my proceedings if, with dear heart’s love, Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts, I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter.	shakespearean
Is it feasible?	modern
In his ignorant jealousy, he’ll totally misunderstand Cassio’s smiles, gestures, and jokes.—How are you, lieutenant?	modern

Such news, my lord, as grieves me to report.	shakespearean
If your leisure served, I would speak with you.	shakespearean
I swear to God it’s true, sir.	modern
How fares my noble lord?	shakespearean
Here comes the man himself.	modern
No, don’t press up against me.	modern
Not till you have slept.	shakespearean
My trusty servant, Ariel!	modern
And shall I couple hell?	shakespearean
Am I sorry that I only had one child?	modern

Ah, there’s the problem.	modern
How does it go with my magnificent Mark Antony?	modern
O, they did urge it still unto the king.	shakespearean

Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.	shakespearean
To Baptista Minola’s house.	modern
Look in on me, and talk with me, or I’ll attack even without a weapon.	modern
This in the public eye?	shakespearean
It is very hot.	shakespearean
That may be, for you bear a many superfluously, and ’twere more honor some were away.	shakespearean
What is there left to do?	modern
I am your own for ever.	shakespearean
If without peril it be possible, Sweet Blunt, make some good means to speak with him, And give him from me this most needful note.	shakespearean

Tell her to come here.	modern
Please, pretty young man, I’d like to get to know you better.	modern
Oh, if you could speak, I might hear you call Caesar an ass who’s been outsmarted!	modern
Well, you’re a liar, then.	modern
Didn’t you clearly say “Knock,” “pound,” and “put your fists to work”?	modern
My husband, then?	shakespearean
And what are you going to do after you’ve spent your money?	modern
I have told him, Lepidus was grown too cruel, That he his high authority abused And did deserve his change.	shakespearean
Yes, he knew about it the whole time.	modern
You have my friendship.	modern
Sir, my good friend, I’ll change that name with you.	shakespearean

But I slip from underneath her and she falls down, crying, “Ow, my butt!” and starts coughing, and then everyone laughs and has fun.	modern
No, ’tis hereafter to know, but now to promise.	shakespearean
These fifteen years you have been in a dream Or, when you waked, so waked as if you slept.	shakespearean
I swam ashore like a duck.	modern
I hope to God I’m wrong about your chances.	modern
I’ll have my lessons in the order and manner	modern
You all know this cloak.	modern
You should ask instead if it’s possible that any criminal could be so rich.	modern

Tis very much.	shakespearean
There is nothing in the world that I love as much as you.	modern
Ay, he was porn at Monmouth, Captain Gower.	shakespearean

Our arms in strength of malice and our hearts Of brothers' temper do receive you in With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.	shakespearean
And mine, to eke out hers.	shakespearean
That’s he that was Othello.	shakespearean
An thou hadst been set i' th' stocks for that question, thou’dst well deserved it.	shakespearean
I won’t take it.	modern
Most like a gentleman.	shakespearean

Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear I never more will break an oath with thee.	shakespearean

The thing is definitely going to be sold.	modern
Even so great men great losses should endure.	shakespearean
Pay him six thousand and deface the bond!	shakespearean
I hope this reason stands for my excuse.	shakespearean
I’ll tell you, good Brutus.	modern
Come your ways.	shakespearean
And since our quarrel is with his future behavior, not what he does now, I must frame the argument like this: if his position is furthered, his character will fulfill these predictions.	modern
The ones you’ve sent our lunatic king to.	modern
What’s going on, my lord?	modern
There’s no place I’d rather die than here by Caesar, and no manner of death would please me more than being stabbed by you, the masters of this new era.	modern
Be not too late.	shakespearean
He has a father, and yet he is fatherless.	modern
I’ll listen to Cassius, and we will compare their reasons.	modern
Yet Benedick was such another, and now is he become a man.	shakespearean
For Brutus' sake, I am beholding to you.	shakespearean
Let her awhile be secretly kept in And publish it that she is dead indeed.	shakespearean
If thou didst it, thou art the nonpareil.	shakespearean
Your lieutenant, Cassio.	modern
Well, we’ll stop, then.	modern
Even for that I thank you.	shakespearean
If ever he have wife, let her be made More miserable by the death of him Than I am made by my poor lord and thee.— Come now towards Chertsey with your holy load, Taken from Paul’s to be interrèd there.	shakespearean

She was only dead, my lord, as long as her slander lived.	modern
To work as a servant.	modern
So I suppose your grace can truly say that I have lost it.	modern
Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve, We would spend it in some words upon that business, If you would grant the time.	shakespearean
But have you put the love juice from the flower on the eyes of that Athenian, as I asked you to do?	modern
Hang not on my garments.	shakespearean

You’ll find us both at Crosby Place.	modern
The gates of mercy will be closed by then, and harsh and hard-hearted soldiers, who have tasted blood, will have free reign to commit whatever violence they want, mowing down your lovely young virgins and budding infants.	modern
You see how naïve and foolish I’ve been.	modern
Where are the noble Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey?	modern
Captain Jamy is a marvelous falorous gentleman, that is certain, and of great expedition and knowledge in th' aunchient wars, upon my particular knowledge of his directions.	shakespearean
We’ll see 'em starve first.	shakespearean
Why, what are you afraid of?	modern
Calls your Worship?	shakespearean
Wear both the ring and my heart, because both are yours.	modern
But your news is not true.	shakespearean
I’ll ask only Benedick to come with me, for from the top of his head to the soles of his feet he’s a joker.	modern
Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?	shakespearean
Sit down and eat, and welcome to our table.	modern
Why dost thou spit at me?	shakespearean
The heart won’t be reasoned with.	modern
I will fight him there.	modern
It’s your job in life to kill the innocent?	modern
We must form a better opinion of ourselves if our uprising can pull the insatiable Antony’s attention away from that Egyptian widow.	modern
Turn, hellhound, turn!	shakespearean
A likely piece of work, that you should find it in your chamber, and not know who left it there!	shakespearean
So don’t think that I’m drunk.	modern
Now, my companions and brothers in exile, hasn’t experience made this simple life sweeter than a life of glittery pomp and circumstance?	modern
and affection, even if it’s just an act.	modern
Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes.	shakespearean
Indeed, they say the senators tomorrow Mean to establish Caesar as a king, And he shall wear his crown by sea and land In every place save here in Italy.	shakespearean
And when please you to say so?	shakespearean
He, sir, that must marry this woman.	shakespearean
Caesar’s sister is called Octavia.	shakespearean
I am content you shall entreat me stay, But yet not stay, entreat me how you can.	shakespearean
I will die bravely, like a smug bridegroom.	shakespearean
My resolution’s placed, and I have nothing Of woman in me.	shakespearean
I saw him holding the handkerchief!	modern
Then we’ll call this the Battle of Agincourt, fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus.	modern
Don’t worry about that.	modern
Which of us are you referring to?	modern
All lost!	shakespearean
I have done my duty.	shakespearean
They finished their business with Pompey, and Pompey has left.	modern
Shall we get started?	modern
True,” she said, “a fine little one.” “No,” I said, “a huge wit.” “Right,” she said, “a hugely awful one.” “No,” I said, “he has a good wit.” “Exactly,” she said, “it’s good and mild; it doesn’t hurt anyone.” “No,” I said, “Benedick is wise.” “He is certainly,” she said,  She cried a lot at that, and said she didn’t care.	modern
But he told me to get lost and threatened to hit me, kick me—even kill me.	modern
You both know Banquo was your enemy.	modern
I stand here for law.	shakespearean
So go in peace.	modern
Then there is the County Palatine.	shakespearean
Tell me truthfully, do you love my sister?	modern
Here, Peter Quince.	modern
How do you feel?	modern
Where’s Antony now?	modern
Get yourself to a church and have a proper priest, who can tell you what marriage is all about, marry you.	modern
This quarry cries on havoc.	shakespearean
For God’s sake, sir, you’ve been robbed.	modern
If I can’t have an estate by birthright, then I’ll get it by being clever.	modern
Good Enobarbus, consider yourself my guest as long as you’re here.	modern
When you have said your lines, go hide in that bush.—Everyone else, go there too when you’re not onstage.	modern
Well, Brutus, thou art noble.	shakespearean
Why, how now, Charmian?	shakespearean
Come on.	modern
I think I hear them.—Stand, ho!	shakespearean
I am scarce in breath, my lord.	shakespearean
Delay not, Caesar.	shakespearean
I’m not asking you to call her.	modern
Swear you won’t.	modern
Even though I don’t see it, this lady thinks I’m a marvelously good-looking man.	modern
Do it well, and then leave us.	modern
Think about it.	modern
Declare thine office.	shakespearean
Is that any thing now?	shakespearean
She confessed.	modern
Stop hollering, man!	modern
James Tyrrel—and your most obedient subject.	modern
Then take him up and manage well the jest.	shakespearean
Are you content to stay?	shakespearean
You lie, you nasty, ungrateful thing!	modern
Let’s be disciplined and not delay, because tomorrow is a busy day.	modern
Why didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius?	shakespearean
Your horn is a foot long, and I’m at least that size.	modern
I see you like to make big offers, sir.	modern
If you’re calling me Jephthah, my lord, I do have a daughter I love more than anything, yes.	modern
I have made strong proof of my constancy, Giving myself a voluntary wound Here in the thigh.	shakespearean
I’m begging you, take the cork out of your mouth so I can drink the news.	modern
Why, the enemy is loud.	shakespearean
How now, Shylock?	shakespearean
These are not natural events.	shakespearean
I’d rather be a dog and howl at the moon than be that kind of Roman.	modern
Actually, an old religious uncle of mine taught me how to speak, and he was brought up in the city.	modern
This cannot be, By no assay of reason.	shakespearean
That’s how we’ll do it, then.	modern
If it be not to come, it will be now.	shakespearean
Know you before whom, sir?	shakespearean
Marry, at the very next turning turn of no hand, but turn down indirectly to the Jew’s house.	shakespearean
Shall I have some water?— Come, Kate, and wash, and welcome heartily.— You whoreson villain!	shakespearean
Call my train together.— Degenerate bastard, I’ll not trouble thee.	shakespearean
I see you’re all determined to gang up on me for a few laughs.	modern
How are you, madam?	modern
When I said that, I was angry too.	modern
This much I can say about him: he is well-born, has proven his bravery in battle, and has established his good character.	modern
You’re wrong, sir, very wrong.	modern
A grandmother is loved hardly less than a mother is.	modern
You teach me how I should act.	modern
I’m almost ready to break down hearing this much.	modern
I thank you, sir.	shakespearean
What hath quenched them hath given me fire.	shakespearean
Start without me.	modern
Now I am no more than a woman, ruled by the same lowly passion as the maid who milks and does the humblest chores.	modern
Into a thousand parts divide one man, And make imaginary puissance.	shakespearean
Wherefore was that cry?	shakespearean
And what will happen if I don’t?	modern
If we walk on the well-worn paths, they won’t get caught in our petticoats.	modern
Then, gentlemen, we can count on trouble.	modern
I will not hold thee long.	shakespearean
Doth he not deserve well?	shakespearean
Your Honor’s is unhealthy talk.	modern
Why, by making him uncapable of Othello’s place: knocking out his brains.	shakespearean
The crowd that follows Caesar at his heels—senators, justices, common petitioners—will suffocate a feeble man almost to death.	modern
My fortune—like that of many of us tonight—is to go drunk to bed.	modern
I was talking to a petitioner here just now, someone who’s suffering from your anger.	modern
The Prince has made the match, and may God bless it.	modern
It’s suppertime, my lord.	shakespearean
But I won’t leave this spot, no matter what they do.	modern
He comes, my lord.	shakespearean
Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand.	shakespearean
My master will be here in the morning.	modern
These men all have one intention, and it’s directed against Caesar.	modern
Patience, I pray you!	shakespearean
With all my heart.—Three or four of you go welcome him.—In the meantime, I’ll read Bellario’s letter out loud.	modern
Bind him, I say.	shakespearean
Good morrow, Benedick.	shakespearean
Ill spirit, I would hold more talk with thee.	shakespearean
You tremble and look pale.	shakespearean
Oh, your contemptible lady!	modern
Not to be endured.	shakespearean
Fare thee well.	shakespearean
The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.	shakespearean
Turn thee back, And tell thy king I do not seek him now But could be willing to march on to Calais Without impeachment, for, to say the sooth, Though ’tis no wisdom to confess so much Unto an enemy of craft and vantage, My people are with sickness much enfeebled, My numbers lessened, and those few I have Almost no better than so many French, Who when they were in health, I tell thee, herald, I thought upon one pair of English legs Did march three Frenchmen.	shakespearean
If we are marked to die, we are enough To do our country loss; and if to live, The fewer men, the greater share of honor.	shakespearean
Not a drop before.	shakespearean
I had rather be married to a death’s-head with a bone in his mouth than to either of these.	shakespearean
By my troth, well met.	shakespearean
You advise me well.	shakespearean
Tell me that you’ll accept my love.	modern
So should a murderer look, so dead, so grim.	shakespearean
I won’t sleep until I’ve delivered your letter, my lord.	modern
What would you have?	shakespearean
What can I tell you?	modern
What if my house be troubled with a rat And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats To have it baned?	shakespearean
I do not know that you are as good a man as myself.	modern
I wouldn’t want to stay here and make you angry.	modern
Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.	shakespearean
When this advice is free I give and honest, Probal to thinking and indeed the course To win the Moor again?	shakespearean
Shall we go see this fortification, men?	modern
If you ever loved your poor dear father— Oh God!	modern
Do not believe That, from the sense of all civility, I thus would play and trifle with your reverence.	shakespearean
I’m amazed how similar you and your daughters are.	modern
The next bit of good news is that our ship—which we gave up for ruined only three hours ago—is as well-outfitted and seaworthy as it was when we first set sail.	modern
Where is thy instrument?	shakespearean
Plain and simple loyalty doesn’t make anyone act phony.	modern
Have I hugged you yet?	modern
Nor must not then be yielded to in this.	shakespearean
Upon my honor— Then came each actor on his ass—	shakespearean
And thy father Was Duke of Milan, and thou his only heir And princess no worse issued.	shakespearean
If I ever have to ask you for something that will put your luck to the test, it’ll be something difficult and terrible.	modern
It’s true.	modern
Nor go neither.	shakespearean
Let’s ha' ’t, good Grumio.	shakespearean
I’m tired of you.	modern
Which else were shame, that then necessity Will call discreet proceeding.	shakespearean
Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads.	shakespearean
It is impossible.	shakespearean
Even if we don’t fight foreign enemies, we’ll beat down these rebels at home.	modern
Tis said they eat each other.	shakespearean
I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown (yet ’twas not a crown neither, ’twas one of these coronets) and, as I told you, he put it by once—but, for all that, to my thinking, he would fain have had it.	shakespearean
Whose noise is this that ones on murder?	shakespearean
She was so young, but she deceived her father so thoroughly he thought it was witchcraft!	modern
I beg you to pardon me.	modern
I’ll tell you truly what I think about the king in my heart.	modern
So Caesar may.	shakespearean
I can’t ask you to make my daughter live—that’s impossible—but I beg you both to tell the people of Messina that she was innocent when she died.	modern
If any man doubt that, let him put me to my purgation.	shakespearean
Good my lord, bid him welcome.	shakespearean
That cannot be, since I am still possessed Of those effects for which I did the murder: My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.	shakespearean
Phoebe wrote it.	modern
I say she never did invent this letter.	shakespearean
The glove which I have given him to wear may possibly win him a box on the ear.	modern
Come hither, neighbor Seacole.	shakespearean
Give me your hand, Roderigo.	modern
Pray God it be, sir.	shakespearean
Why have you left the chamber?	shakespearean
It’s bitterly cold out, and I’m depressed.	modern
Oh, killing that child was the dirtiest, most merciless deed there ever was!	modern
I commanded the sleeves should be cut out and sewed up again, and that I’ll prove upon thee, though thy little finger be armed in a thimble.	shakespearean
But don’t be too tame, either—let your good sense guide you.	modern
Yea, but you must not make the full show of this till you may do it without controlment.	shakespearean
Well, forward, forward!	shakespearean
Charles did the same to the second brother, and the third.	modern
No, monster, not me.	modern
Then fly!	shakespearean
He that has a house to put ’s head in has a good headpiece.	shakespearean
Fortune is happy today and, in this mood, will give us anything we want.	modern
My eyes itch—is that an omen I’ll be crying soon?	modern
Who’s there!	modern
They shouted thrice.	shakespearean
But who would dare tell her?	modern
How late is it, lords?	modern
If I said something, she’d mock me so mercilessly that I’d probably disintegrate into air.	modern
And smelled like that, too?	modern
My strange and self-abuse Is the initiate fear that wants hard use.	shakespearean
Then you might as well say they’re not dead.	modern
The same to you, my lord!	modern
How dare I?	modern
And so, I pray thee, call Beatrice.	shakespearean
Yes, but I am insulting myself by thinking this way.	modern
His name is Tyrrel, my lord.	modern
Ever since I arrived here, just now, I’ve been hearing strange rumors.	modern
I never did like molestation view On the enchafèd flood.	shakespearean
My master has instructed me to go to Saint Luke’s to tell the priest to be ready in case you should show up with your better half.	modern
Be patient, madam.	modern
Your words have moved me, and maybe it’ll do some good.	modern
I durst, my lord, to wager she is honest, Lay down my soul at stake.	shakespearean
And yet I would not be thee, nuncle.	shakespearean
If he come tomorrow, I’ll give him his payment.	shakespearean
I see, sir, you are liberal in offers.	shakespearean
Who’s there?	shakespearean
So is my horse, Octavius, and for that I do appoint him store of provender.	shakespearean
I will stand, and so shall Trinculo.	shakespearean
No, but she let it drop by negligence And, to th' advantage, I being here, took ’t up.	shakespearean
When he’s there next time, I’ll send my daughter to see him.	modern
Go to, they are not men o' their words.	shakespearean
I will hear that play.	shakespearean
It’s my exercise time.	modern
Richard loves neither me nor any of you.	modern
Lord Hamlet— Heaven secure him!	shakespearean
That’s not so good.	shakespearean
Dolor comes to him, indeed.	shakespearean
Where are my good fellows?	modern
Arise, you shall not kneel.	shakespearean
You do but dally.	shakespearean
Cassio’s not dead?	modern
I swear, I don’t like the look of you.	modern
She confesses it.	shakespearean
Time travels in diverse paces with diverse persons.	shakespearean
But these cannot I command to any utterance of harmony.	shakespearean
Now are we well prepared to know the pleasure Of our fair cousin Dauphin, for we hear Your greeting is from him, not from the king.	shakespearean
You are their heir, you sit upon their throne, The blood and courage that renownèd them Runs in your veins; and my thrice-puissant liege Is in the very May-morn of his youth, Ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises.	shakespearean
I gave my lover a ring and made him swear never to lose it or give it away.	modern
Another case: King Lewis the Tenth, who was sole heir to the usurper Capet, could not rest easy as king until he was assured that Queen Isabel, his grandmother, was a direct descendent of the Lady Ermengare, daughter of the aforementioned Charles duke of Lorraine, by which marriage the line of Charles the Great was reunited with the throne of France.	modern
Enough of this.	modern
I will pause for a reply.	modern
I feared he did but trifle And meant to wreck thee.	shakespearean
Age hasn’t dried up my body or eroded my intelligence so much, and luck hasn’t robbed me of so much of my fortune, and my bad ways haven’t deprived me of so many friends, that they won’t find me ready to seek revenge both physically and mentally, with money and friends at my disposal.	modern
There’s been a whole debate on the topic.	modern
For what offence?	shakespearean
We’ll go together, and before we’ve spent all the savings of your youth, we’ll find a way to make a living.	modern
From their saddles into the dirt—but that’s another story.	modern
Rude ragged nurse, old sullen playfellow For tender princes, use my babies well.	shakespearean
Do you smell a fault?	shakespearean
He doesn’t miss a thing.	modern
The hour has almost come when I have to return to the horrible flames of purgatory.	modern
This night—wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch, The lion and the belly-pinchèd wolf Keep their fur dry—unbonneted he runs, And bids what will take all.	shakespearean
Fool, do not flatter yourself.	modern
And no doubt he is, gracious madam.	modern
If she be in her chamber or your house, Let loose on me the justice of the state For thus deluding you.	shakespearean
Thank you kindly.	modern
But his kindness was nobler than even his desire for revenge, his natural goodness was stronger than his need to give his brother what he deserved.	modern
What are you doing with a sword?	modern
Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar’s body.	shakespearean
Thrice noble lord, I beg you to excuse me for another night or two—or at least until nightfall.	modern
Because Pyramus is a good-looking man, the most handsome man that you could find on a summer’s day, a lovely gentlemanly man.	modern
Bid them all fly.	shakespearean
Make forth.	shakespearean
I do not understand.	shakespearean
Whither away?	shakespearean
Lies all within.—Deliver me the key.	shakespearean
Anon we’ll drink a measure The table round.	shakespearean
As for my wife, if only you had such a wife.	modern
Will it never be day?	shakespearean
What do you want?	modern
What’s Antony?	shakespearean
You’ve won.	modern
Oh, you evil woman!	modern
Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes Between the pass and fell incensèd points Of mighty opposites.	shakespearean
At your noble pleasure.	shakespearean
But he kept chattering so foolishly, talking about you in such insulting and despicable terms, that it was hard for me to restrain myself.	modern
How 'gree you now?	shakespearean
When you are gentle, you shall have one, too, and not till then.	modern
All right, I understand.	modern
I won’t exhaust you anymore with idle chitchat.	modern
O valiant cousin!	shakespearean
Well, that turned out well in the end.	modern
Your wife Octavia, with her modest eyes And still conclusion, shall acquire no honor Demuring upon me.	shakespearean
By the future.	modern
No, nor more fearful.	shakespearean
He begs you to spare his life.	modern
For lawyers on vacation, because they sleep their holidays away, with no sense of how time moves.	modern
Yes, sir, I’m here.	modern
He’s welcome too.	modern
Oh, my lord, my lord, forgive my panic!	modern
I beg you to let me go.	modern
Alack, what noise is this?	shakespearean
This tyrant, whose mere name is so awful it hurts us to say it, was once considered an honest man.	modern
Heavens shield Lysander if they mean a fray!	shakespearean
Come, tailor, let us see ’t.	shakespearean
Come away with me.	modern
Friends, come here.	modern
Thoughts work so quickly that even now you can imagine him on Blackheath, where his lords suggest that he should carry his battle-scarred sword and helmet on a procession through the city.	modern
She’ll die for it.—Eros, ho!	modern
Impudent strumpet!	shakespearean
I will be here again, even with a thought.	shakespearean
Any villain in Denmark is going to be, well, a villain.	modern
Won’t the dawn come from here?	modern
Four days will quickly steep themselves in night.	shakespearean
Never a moment of peace!	modern
Father, ’tis thus: yourself and all the world That talked of her have talked amiss of her.	shakespearean
He is my dear friend, your Majesty.	modern
If I could beg others to change their minds, begging would convince me, too.	modern
And lovers' absent hours More tedious than the dial eightscore times!	shakespearean
Three thousand ducats for three months, and Antonio will guarantee it.	modern
It’s good we had this meeting.	modern
I do not think so.	shakespearean
Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns.	shakespearean
Pray you, leave your courtesy, good monsieur.	shakespearean
Pray, give me that.	shakespearean
There be land rats and water rats, water thieves and land thieves—I mean pirates—and then there is the peril of waters, winds, and rocks.	shakespearean
And so farewell, Signior Lucentio.	shakespearean
I have to do these things before I have a chance to think about them.	modern
Of Mantua.	shakespearean
Yes, the fashion is the fashion.	shakespearean
Isn’t he here?	modern
Thanks, dear my lord.	shakespearean
Hello, good sir.	modern
Nay, you were better speak first, and when you were graveled for lack of matter, you might take occasion to kiss.	shakespearean
Shylock, there’s thrice thy money offered thee.	shakespearean
She died, my lord, but whiles her slander lived.	shakespearean
What, in my sight?—Bianca, get thee in.	shakespearean
What are you accused of?	modern
Your heart’s desires be with you.	shakespearean
Let her alone.	shakespearean
Who sent you this time?	modern
Send out more cavalry.	modern
What a miracle!	modern
Why is your cheek so pale?	shakespearean
Now I arise.	shakespearean
Ah, leave it alone.	modern
Good madam.	shakespearean
Avaunt, you cullions!	shakespearean
Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life Cuts off so many years of fearing death.	shakespearean
You understand me?	shakespearean
Know me for Brutus!	shakespearean
So why does it seem so particular to you?	modern
First kiss me, Kate, and then we will.	modern
Welcome, Signior.	shakespearean
Good my lord, If I have any grace or power to move you His present reconciliation take.	shakespearean
Therefore, when he has reason to fear, as we do, his fears are without question of the same order.	modern
Let quick sulfurous lightning, strong enough to split enormous trees, singe the white hair on my head.	modern
He sees himself in my two eyes, so there’s two of him.	modern
But I reversed the death sentence.	modern
Follow them straight to the cottage.	modern
Tell him I’ve spoken to my husband on his behalf, and I think everything will be all right.	modern
I have done no more to Caesar than you shall do to Brutus.	shakespearean
He, for his father’s sake, so loves the prince That he will not be won to aught against him.	shakespearean
Good morrow to your Worship.	shakespearean
Oh, are you really!	modern
O sir, to wilful men, The injuries that they themselves procure Must be their schoolmasters.	shakespearean
The king wishes to know if you want to play against him right away, or wait awhile.	modern
He said he did—I don’t know.	modern
Go to.	shakespearean
His running away has everything to do with fear and nothing to do with love.	modern
And Walter couldn’t get his dagger out of its sheath.	modern
Would your Honor like to try this dried fruit?	modern
He’s a good fellow, I can tell you that much.	modern
What have I ever done that he has anything to complain about?	modern
Poor Tom’s a-cold.	shakespearean
Caesar greets the Queen of Egypt and asks that you consider what you will ask from him.	modern
Conscience,” I say, “you give good advice.” “Devil,” I say, “you give good advice.” If I listened to my conscience, I’d stay with the Jew my master, who’s a devil.	modern
I have sent for the strawberries.	modern
Have at the very eye of that proverb with “A pox of the devil.”  You are the better at proverbs, by how much “A fool’s bolt is soon shot.”  You have shot over.	shakespearean
Then my love is humble.	modern
I know you by the waggling of your head.	shakespearean
I prefer to call it a “hanger.” But anyway.	modern
No more, I pray you.	shakespearean
Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you.	shakespearean
You must away tonight.	shakespearean
What’s happening now, Lucillius?	modern
Then ’tis he: the rest That are within the note of expectation Already are i' th' court.	shakespearean
I’ll not fight with thee.	shakespearean
Twere good you let him know, For who that’s but a queen, fair, sober, wise, Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib, Such dear concernings hide?	shakespearean
Your bedroom.	modern
Thou hast a sister by the mother’s side, Admired Octavia.	shakespearean
Is it no more but this—a tardiness in nature Which often leaves the history unspoke That it intends to do?—My lord of Burgundy, What say you to the lady?	shakespearean
Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.	shakespearean
O conspiracy, Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night When evils are most free?	shakespearean
Doesn’t that make you want to cry?	modern
Your father is a sailmaker in Bergamo.	modern
If you don’t like him you should quit.	modern
You and I cannot be held within the confines of a country’s arbitrary customs, dear Kate.	modern
Who’s born that day When I forget to send to Antony Shall die a beggar.	shakespearean
Let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him.	shakespearean
That way I can conquer my own fear and sleep easy at night.	modern
I don’t feel guilty about them at all.	modern
I don’t know him.	modern
The two of us will guard you while you sleep, my lord, and keep you safe.	modern
Look, I don’t love you, so stop following me around.	modern
Now let my courage prove my title as wife.	modern
Age won’t wither her, and her charms are so varied that she never grows boring.	modern
Why, so did you.	modern
Indeed, the enemy nearly took the bridge, but he was forced to retreat, and the duke of Exeter holds the bridge.	modern
If they have done this thing, my noble lord— If?	modern
And it is very much lamented, Brutus, That you have no such mirrors as will turn Your hidden worthiness into your eye That you might see your shadow.	shakespearean
Be there, or don’t show your face again.	modern
Twas yet some comfort When misery could beguile the tyrant’s rage And frustrate his proud will.	shakespearean
Thy mother’s name is ominous to children.	shakespearean
It’s Hortensio, isn’t it?	modern
But brother Anthony—     Come, ’tis no matter.	shakespearean
My Lord of Cambridge, and my kind Lord of Masham, And you, my gentle knight, give me your thoughts.	shakespearean
And hello to you, fair sister.	modern
Oh, now you weep, and, I perceive, you feel The dint of pity.	shakespearean
Get it ready immediately.	modern
I have not art to reckon my groans, but that I love thee best, oh, most best, believe it.	shakespearean
Stay, madam.	shakespearean
Yes, we are.	modern
Keep your word, Phoebe, that you’ll marry me Or else, refusing me, to wed this shepherd.	shakespearean
Fetch Desdemona hither.	shakespearean
Of what your reverence shall incite us to.	shakespearean
We’re ready for both, my lord.	modern
Drink when I order you, servant-monster.	modern
Although I can’t make his ship disappear, I can still make his journey miserable.	modern
These things are beyond all use, And I do fear them.	shakespearean
You’d have to be as lazy as a weed on the shores of  I knew it!	modern
Oh, to hell with those people!	modern
Tomorrow shall you know our mind at full.	shakespearean
Therefore give me no counsel.	shakespearean
Oh, no, that was my lady’s voice.	modern
The queen your mother, in most great affliction of spirit, hath sent me to you.	shakespearean
And I know that unless the law intervenes, it’ll be bad news for poor Antonio.	modern
For he loves to hear That unicorns may be betrayed with trees, And bears with glasses, elephants with holes, Lions with toils, and men with flatterers.	shakespearean
Woe, alas!	shakespearean
Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily.	shakespearean
Didn’t they ever whisper?	modern
Are you ashamed of me?	modern
What do kings have that private men do not, besides the pomp of their position?	modern
Yes, gracious madam.	shakespearean
He was wrong to do that.	modern
Our fate depends on this chance.	modern
To get what you want, you need to get Cassio out of the way.	modern
But as I think—for truly would I speak, And now do I bethink me, so it is— I came with Hermia hither.	shakespearean
But it can’t help either!	modern
Yes, that’s for sure.	modern

For, you know, Pyramus and Thisbe meet by moonlight.	shakespearean
Thou know’st we work by wit and not by witchcraft, And wit depends on dilatory time.	shakespearean
Don’t simply hide your hatred.	modern
Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight.	shakespearean
Sir, in fine, Seeing how loathly opposite I stood To his unnatural purpose, in fell motion, With his preparèd sword he charges home My unprovided body, latched mine arm.	shakespearean
Good morrow, Casca.—Caius Ligarius, Caesar was ne'er so much your enemy As that same ague which hath made you lean.	shakespearean
Ha' to thee, lad!	shakespearean
Come, sir, no more.—Oswald, come here!	modern
Yet I have not seen So likely an ambassador of love.	shakespearean
He once said the devil would get him because of women.	modern
Please, if you can do it without taking advantage of the young man, buy the cottage, pasture, and flock for us, and we’ll pay you for it.	modern
Come on.	modern
For, as I am a soldier, the name I think suits me best, once I begin my attack on Harfleur again, I will not leave the half-conquered town until she lies buried in her own ashes.	modern
Write me a prologue, and let the prologue seem to say we will do no harm with our swords, and that Pyramus is not killed indeed.	shakespearean
Look at you, thrashing about like a blind man.	modern
Dismiss your attendant there, look ’t be done.	shakespearean
Still it cried, “Sleep no more!” to all the house.	shakespearean
Meet me at the palace as soon as possible.	modern
No more amazement.	shakespearean
Your disloyal uncle—are you paying attention?	modern
You have killed a sweet lady, and her death shall fall heavy on you.	shakespearean
Where are thy two sons?	shakespearean
Some people kiss shadows.	modern
Go, Pindarus, climb a little higher on this hill.	modern
How dost thou, Benedick, the married man?	shakespearean
Lorenzo will be happy with what we’ve done.	modern
Hover about her; say that right for right Hath dimmed your infant morn to agèd night.	shakespearean
What’s else to say?—                                                          These quicksands, Lepidus, Keep off them, for you sink.	shakespearean
Thou shouldst know There were a heart in Egypt.	shakespearean
I’ll chop her into pieces.	modern
Amen, with all my heart.	shakespearean
And you, good sir.	shakespearean
She shall not harm thee, Helena.	shakespearean
I’d like you to, see, because you don’t like it, and because it isn’t to your taste, and because it doesn’t agree with you.	modern
But he isn’t here now.	modern
It’s time to leave.	modern
Kind Tyrrel, will your news make me happy?	modern
Anon, anon!	shakespearean
You’ve got it wrong, old man.	modern
Now it’s time to get your costumes together.	modern
I pity thy complaining.	shakespearean
So much for Fortinbras.	modern
Add to these eight thousand four hundred knights, squires, and brave gentlemen, five hundred of whom were given the title of knight only yesterday.	modern
No boasting like a fool.	shakespearean
That was a likely story, that you found it in your room and didn’t know who it belonged to.	modern
They are about the court, And, as I think, they have already order This night to play before him.	shakespearean
Come here.	modern
No, I said his horse is coming, with him on its back.	modern
Give me your neaf, Monsieur Mustardseed.	shakespearean
God bless you, Bottom, God bless you.	modern
It’s difficult to have such immaturity so close to my heart, but bear with me.	modern
Poor soul!	shakespearean
I assure you, Carthage.	shakespearean
Wot you what, my lord?	shakespearean
Man, they were asking for it.	modern
There is occasions and causes why and wherefore in all things.	shakespearean
Will your Majesty grant us permission to freely express the message we’ve been asked to convey?	modern
I think I told your lordship a year since how much I am in the favor of Margaret, the waiting gentlewoman to Hero.	shakespearean
Fathers that wear rags  Do make their children blind.	shakespearean
When think you that the sword goes up again?	shakespearean
God defend me from these two!	shakespearean
What makes that frontlet on?	shakespearean
Here comes another of the tribe.	shakespearean
About the ninth hour, lady.	shakespearean
Knock, knock!	modern
To horse, you gallant princes, straight to horse.	shakespearean
Here I am, your slave—a poor, sick, weak, hated old man.	modern
God quit you in His mercy.	shakespearean
I’m not sure, my lord.	modern
Thinking, my lord?	modern
I’ll follow thee and make a heaven of hell, To die upon the hand I love so well.	shakespearean
Nay, come, let’s go together.	shakespearean
Say, what?	shakespearean
At the duke’s oak we meet.	shakespearean
Go with me to a notary, seal me there Your single bond, and—in a merry sport— If you repay me not on such a day, In such a place, such sum or sums as are Expressed in the condition, let the forfeit Be nominated for an equal pound Of your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken In what part of your body pleaseth me.	shakespearean
People with too much invested in the world always get hurt.	modern
God keep your Lordship in that gracious mind.	shakespearean
The limit of your lives is out.	shakespearean
You may light on a husband that hath no beard.	shakespearean
What say you?	shakespearean
I take ’t ’tis later, sir.	shakespearean
For your desire to know what is between us, O'ermaster ’t as you may.	shakespearean
And unrespective boys.	shakespearean
Well, the tree bears rotten fruit.	modern
We will proceed no further in this business.	shakespearean
What would you?	shakespearean
Shut up your doors, my lord.	shakespearean
Yet would I knew That stroke would prove the worst!	shakespearean
My brother and thy uncle, called Antonio— I pray thee, mark me (that a brother should Be so perfidious!	shakespearean
He certainly flattered them both with extravagant compliments.	modern
Tell my servants not to mention that we were gone.	modern
In this last tempest.	shakespearean
Bid him set on his powers betimes before, And we will follow.	shakespearean
Troth, no, no more than reason.	shakespearean
Farewell, lady.	modern
If we have sweet-smelling breath, I’m sure they’ll say “it’s a sweet play.” Now no more talking.	modern
Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter.	shakespearean
Your eyes are like stars, and your voice is more musical than a lark’s song is to a shepherd in the springtime.	modern
Not I, my lord.	shakespearean
Look, here he comes.	modern
I can suck melancholy out of a song as a weasel sucks eggs.	shakespearean
You heard her say it wasn’t me.	modern
If you aren’t weeping, it’s a good sign that I’ll soon have a new father.	modern
Yes, it’s definitely nippy.	modern
Please listen to me carefully.	modern
I am sorry to hear this.	shakespearean
This is the end of my journey, the end of my life.	modern
But sir, he’s crazy.	modern
We’ll be there, and there we’ll rehearse courageously and wonderfully, truly obscenely.	modern
You are in the right.	shakespearean
By all that’s holy, here comes Katherina!	modern
Where is that knocking coming from?	modern
Go in with me.	shakespearean
Where is this man?	modern
Katherine his daughter and with her, to dowry, Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms.	shakespearean
Conquer, crush, conclude, and kill!	modern
But, like the owner of a foul disease, To keep it from divulging, let it feed Even on the pith of life.	shakespearean
You’ll beat me?	modern
It’s disgraceful!	modern
What, you dare put your hands on me, villain?	modern
Oh Cassius, I’m tired out by many sorrows.	modern
But take a taste of my finding him, and relish it with good observance.	shakespearean
Sooth, madam, I hear nothing.	shakespearean
Everyone who comes to gamble on winning me has to swear to these three rules.	modern
O, then I see you will part but with light gifts.	shakespearean
You are very welcome here, sir.	modern
But in this kind, wanting your father’s voice, The other must be held the worthier.	shakespearean
Sir, I am vexed.	shakespearean
Yes, revered Queen.	modern
He was quick mettle when he went to school.	shakespearean
Are you so pious that you would pray for this man and his children, a man who has pushed you toward an early grave and put your family in poverty forever?	modern
I don’t know.	modern
I hope things go well there.	modern
But though we think it so, it is no matter.	shakespearean
A drunkard or a corpse?	modern
As sure as I’m standing here, I saw him.	modern
Me too.	modern
Nay, ’tis twice two months, my lord.	shakespearean
Ely with Richmond troubles me more near Than Buckingham and his rash-levied strength.	shakespearean
Oh, that his fault should make a knave of thee, That art not what th’ art sure of!	shakespearean
Transform your grief into anger.	modern
Let it fall rather, though the fork invade The region of my heart.	shakespearean
We must bear all.	shakespearean
Not yet.”      The hour’s now come.	shakespearean
Come, come!	shakespearean
I doubt it is no other but the main: His father’s death and our o'erhasty marriage.	shakespearean
Good-bye, my lord.	modern
Indeed, he’s not right for this.	modern
Murellus and Flavius have been punished for pulling scarves off statues of Caesar.	modern
Yes, Caesar?	modern
Whither away?	shakespearean
Ay, my good lord.	shakespearean
He hath the jewel of my life in hold, His youngest daughter, beautiful Bianca, And her withholds from me and other more, Suitors to her and rivals in my love, Supposing it a thing impossible, For those defects I have before rehearsed, That ever Katherina will be wooed.	shakespearean
The king has strictly forbidden it.	modern
Madam, I had rather seal my lips Than to my peril speak that which is not.	shakespearean
What’s that noise?	modern
Beware of March 15th.	modern
You, who are neither honest nor good.	modern
Could you really do such a thing, for all the world?	modern
Oh, come on.	modern
Unleash the dogs in the western valley.	modern
Well, I’m sorry for you, gentle Silvius.	modern
What, dead, my dove?	shakespearean
I swear by this hand that I love you.	modern
Come with me and I’ll get it for you.	modern
It’s a very sad day.	modern
Today the lords you talked of are beheaded.	shakespearean
Oh, Pyramus, get up!	modern
To whose hands You have sent the lunatic king.	shakespearean
Tell Antony that Brutus has been taken.	modern
That’s what makes it “sensitive” news.	modern
It was obviously a hit.	modern
It makes us, or it mars us.	shakespearean
Sir, speed you.	shakespearean
Now all the youth of England are on fire, And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies.	shakespearean
Fare you well, Jessica.	shakespearean
I’ll never see the likes of him again.	modern
Lord, how painful it was to drown.	modern
My soul is stuck to sin, and the more it struggles to break free, the more it sticks.	modern
If he do bleed, I’ll gild the faces of the grooms withal, For it must seem their guilt.	shakespearean
We three are married, but you two are sped.	shakespearean
Then he shook Bassanio’s hand affectionately—and they separated.	modern
The earl of Pembroke keeps his regiment— Good Captain Blunt, bear my goodnight to him, And by the second hour in the morning Desire the earl to see me in my tent.	shakespearean
Tis hard; almost impossible.	shakespearean
No, it is not possible you should love the enemy of France, Kate.	shakespearean
But even so, I’ll make doubly sure.	modern
Oh, what an excellent young man!	modern
Art thou of Cornish crew?	shakespearean
Good-bye, good Queen.	modern
Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast—and but twelve persons there!	shakespearean
Then let them use us well, else let them know, The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.	shakespearean
Lord, it’s glancing every which way!	modern
My bond to the Jew is forfeit.	shakespearean
No more of drowning, do you hear?	shakespearean
Call the clotpoll back.	shakespearean
I am no traitor.	shakespearean
Women are lucky, then.	modern
So confess your sin freely now.	modern
If thus thou vanishest, thou tell’st the world It is not worth leave-taking.	shakespearean
So they do nothing, ’tis a venial slip.	shakespearean
What it is, my Caius, I shall unfold to thee as we are going To whom it must be done.	shakespearean
Wooed me to steal it, but she so loves the token (For he conjured her she should ever keep it) That she reserves it evermore about her To kiss and talk to.	shakespearean
Lord Babyface over there will meet me in a duel, and good luck to him then.	modern
Oh, curse of marriage That we can call these delicate creatures ours And not their appetites!	shakespearean
The tragic actors from the city, the ones you used to enjoy so much.	modern
Whither am I going?	shakespearean
On my honor, I swear I love Rivers with all my heart.	modern
But then the mind much sufferance doth o'erskip When grief hath mates and bearing fellowship.	shakespearean
The French might have a good prey of us if he knew of it, for there is none to guard it but boys.	shakespearean
Yes, that’s me.	modern
Oh, he’s good at bending words around!	modern
Here, catch this casket.	shakespearean
An awful monster!	modern
But everything that lives is mortal, including the foolishness of love.	modern
And although we’re giving these honors to this man so that he shares some of the blame for what we’re doing, he’ll carry these honors like a jackass carries gold—groaning and sweating under the load, either led or pushed, as we direct him.	modern
My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.	shakespearean
That song tonight Will not go from my mind.	shakespearean
Aren’t the mayor and his fellow citizens coming?	modern
Partly to confirm my opinion and partly for the satisfaction, see, of my mind, with respect to the demands of proper military practice—that’s the point?	modern
Take you some company, and away to horse.	shakespearean
I’ll give you the title to that ship and its treasure.	modern
They sit chatting by the parlor fire.	modern
What sayest thou now?	shakespearean
Only I here importune death awhile, until Of many thousand kisses the poor last I lay upon thy lips.	shakespearean
But I have a sinking feeling anyway.	modern
So now everyone will point at me and say, “Look, there goes the wife of that comedian Petruchio—if he could be bothered to marry the pathetic thing!”	modern
Our general’s wife is now the general.	shakespearean
Here’s Cassio hurt by villains.	shakespearean
I’ll drink to Hamlet’s health, and into his goblet I’ll drop a pearl even more costly than those in the crowns of the last four Danish kings.	modern
Well, what is it?	shakespearean
And the Prince and Claudio, who accused her, are innocent as well, because they were deceived by Don John.	modern
Therefore let’s follow.	shakespearean
These three world-sharers, these competitors, Are in thy vessel.	shakespearean
This gentleman will out-talk us all.	shakespearean
Put on my crown.	modern
And he’s still warm, by God.	modern
You’ve forgotten the will I told you about.	modern
Remember March, the ides of March remember.	shakespearean
What, bear her in hand until they come to take hands and then, with public accusation, uncovered slander, unmitigated rancor—O God, that I were a man!	shakespearean
What masque, what music?	shakespearean
Come hither, good Volumnius.	shakespearean
If you’re being fair, you’ll have to describe me as someone who loved too much, but who wasn’t wise about it.	modern
Give my love to my kind husband.	modern
Go but with me tonight, you shall see her chamber window entered, even the night before her wedding day.	shakespearean
Who comes here?	shakespearean
I know thee well—a serviceable villain, As duteous to the vices of thy mistress As badness would desire.	shakespearean
My liberty.	shakespearean
He hath honored me of late, and I have bought Golden opinions from all sorts of people, Which would be worn now in their newest gloss, Not cast aside so soon.	shakespearean
Maybe you think that I think you’re in love.	modern
Go on, Caesar.	modern
My lord, you don’t need to apologize.	modern
But lend it rather to thine enemy, Who, if he break, thou mayst with better face Exact the penalty.	shakespearean
Hot, hot, and moist.	shakespearean
I’m being called.	modern
It’s true, they’re inconsistent.	modern
More, more, I prithee, more.	shakespearean
Greed has been the downfall of many kings.	modern
Come with my lady hither.	shakespearean
There’s no room for the old man and his followers.	modern
I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your suspicion is not without wit and judgment.	shakespearean
Lady, did you sleep in her room last night?	modern
My voice is now the king’s, my looks mine own.	shakespearean
All we do is sit and sit and eat and eat.	modern
That’s me.	modern
More villain thou.—Well, push him out of doors And let my officers of such a nature Make an extent upon his house and lands.	shakespearean
You may as well do anything most hard, As seek to soften that—than which what’s harder?— His Jewish heart.	shakespearean
O dear Phoebe, If ever—as that ever may be near— You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy, Then shall you know the wounds invisible That love’s keen arrows make.	shakespearean
We’re waiting here for you.	modern
This is your job.	modern
Humble greetings, great master!	modern
Good Enobarbus, ’tis a worthy deed, And shall become you well, to entreat your captain To soft and gentle speech.	shakespearean
Is that what he says?	modern
I don’t like sports.	modern
I am sorry that I am deceived in him.	shakespearean
You’re taking it more seriously than I meant it.	modern
If we do lose this battle, then is this The very last time we shall speak together.	shakespearean
There’s the respect That makes calamity of so long life.	shakespearean
And am I then revenged	shakespearean
County Claudio, when mean you to go to church?	shakespearean
The more I love him, the more he hates me.	modern
What dost thou know me for?	shakespearean
Me too.	modern
You have offered me the lands of Sicily and Sardinia.	modern
Sit then and talk with her.	shakespearean
Can’t any prayers reach your heart?	modern
Which soon he granted, Being an obstruct ’tween his lust and him.	shakespearean
I am feared in field and town.	shakespearean
Tell him, when that our princely father York Blessed his three sons with his victorious arm, He little thought of this divided friendship.	shakespearean
For you, I give myself away and I’m ecstatic about the exchange.	modern
My lord, your promise of the earldom— Richmond!	modern
Where’s satisfaction?	shakespearean
And to that place the sharp Athenian law Cannot pursue us.	shakespearean
Sir, grieve not you.	shakespearean
Master, for my hand, Both our inventions meet and jump in one.	shakespearean
Does that necessarily mean you should love his son?	modern
Fire and brimstone!	shakespearean
God say, “Amen”!	modern
Do thy worst.	shakespearean
A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.	shakespearean
Cheer your heart.	shakespearean
The sight is dismal, And our affairs from England come too late.	shakespearean
Thomas the earl of Surrey and himself, Much about cockshut time, from troop to troop Went through the army cheering up the soldiers.	shakespearean
It will give you some protection from this storm.	modern
It’s sad, but Iago knows she had sex with Cassio a thousand times.	modern
What, even you, Brutus?	modern
Therefore weep.	shakespearean
She says that you should come to her.	modern
I won’t have anything to do with it.	modern
I was telling you he used witchcraft to take this island.	modern
I’m afraid he’ll punish me.	modern
In every good thing.	shakespearean
Their lips, like four red roses on a stalk, touched.	modern
What about Falconbridge, that young English baron?	modern
Their papers is more lawful.	shakespearean
Celerity is never more admired Than by the negligent.	shakespearean
Give me your first, Mr. Mustardseed.	modern
Some villain hath done me wrong.	shakespearean
You shall have wine enough, my lord, anon.	shakespearean
Most meet That first we come to words, and therefore have we Our written purposes before us sent, Which, if thou hast considered, let us know If ’twill tie up thy discontented sword And carry back to Sicily much tall youth That else must perish here.	shakespearean
These ones, then, will be assassinated.	modern
The most exquisite Claudio?	shakespearean
Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold Our Caesar’s vesture wounded?	shakespearean
Anyway, go tell your master I am here.	modern
Has anyone offended your Worship?	modern
He was very upset that Fortinbras had taken advantage of his being old and sick to deceive him, and he ordered Fortinbras’s arrest.	modern
But dead they are, and devilish slave, by thee.	shakespearean
I took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to thank me.	shakespearean
Shake it off.	shakespearean
Yes, that’s the one.	modern
Buckingham, I need to have a word with you.	modern
Sweet Phoebe, pity me.	shakespearean
While he was still in Rome, he deployed his forces in so many different disguises that all our spies were fooled.	modern
Nay, pray be covered.	shakespearean
A snake could do that as easily as you could.	modern
No more about that, please.	modern
I hold you but a subject of this war, Not as a brother.	shakespearean
Who’s that coming over here?	modern
And jealous Oberon would have the child Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild.	shakespearean
It is offended.	shakespearean
Her fallow leas The darnel, hemlock, and rank fumitory Doth root upon, while that the coulter rusts That should deracinate such savagery.	shakespearean
Carry me, good friends, to where Cleopatra is.	modern
Yes, and his relative, too.	modern
Everyone there got a little crazy and pulled some desperate stunts.	modern
These things sting His mind so venomously that burning shame Detains him from Cordelia.	shakespearean
That handkerchief thou speak’st of I found by fortune and did give my husband.	shakespearean
She has the patience of a  I’ll see you hanged on Sunday first!	modern
Didn’t you send Lysander, as an insult, to follow me around praising my eyes and my face?	modern
A plague upon you all!	shakespearean
Anything your Highness suffered in that disguise, I beg you to see it as your own fault and not mine, because if you’d been what I took you for, there would have been no offense.	modern
You are rather point-device in your accouterments, as loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other.	shakespearean
Bellario sends his greetings.	modern
It may be so.	modern
Adieu, good Mr. Depression.	modern
I’ll follow him no more with bootless prayers.	shakespearean
Delighted to stay?	modern
What is this castle called that stands hard by?	shakespearean
At land, thou know’st How much we do o’ercount thee.	shakespearean
I’ll plague him.	shakespearean
Come thou no more for ransom, gentle herald.	shakespearean
And why’s that?	modern
Go, Eros, send his treasure after.	shakespearean
I wasn’t expecting you, and I’m not ready to receive you.	modern
Well, there they are.	modern
Because of your advice and your help, I have a high position now.	modern
I doubt you’d thank me in the end, but she’s rich, all right, very rich.	modern
As well as I can, madam.	shakespearean
If she will return me my jewels I will give over my suit and repent my unlawful solicitation.	shakespearean
Why comest thou?	shakespearean
He’s afraid to come in.	modern
But yet for all that, an if she did not hate him deadly, she would love him dearly.	shakespearean
Alack, our terrene moon is now eclipsed, And it portends alone the fall of Antony.	shakespearean
He’s that he is.	shakespearean
Oh, I see, you will only part with lightweight presents.	modern
Know him I shall, I am well sure of it.	shakespearean
Stop Harry of England, who is now sweeping through our land with banners drenched in the French blood he spilled at Harfleur.	modern
I feel awful for my cousin.	modern
If I had only died an hour before this event I could say I had lived a blessed life.	modern
I came here to tell you—I’ll make this short, since she’s already been talked about for too long—the lady is unfaithful.	modern
Sir, the king— Yes, what about him?	modern
But I’m ashamed to kiss, sir.	modern
Do you remember anyone who died of it?	modern
I do, truly, for thou swear’st to me thou art honest.	shakespearean
Madam, I go with all convenient speed.	shakespearean
Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.	shakespearean
I think so too.	modern
Come, tailor, let us see these ornaments.	shakespearean
Who will go with me?	shakespearean
I don’t know what you’re talking about.	modern
In emergencies you meet the strangest folks.	modern
Hard, hard.—O filthy traitor!	shakespearean
If you say that, you’ll only be telling the truth.	modern
I know that she is worthy of that love.	modern
If I live through this, I’ll be good to you.	modern
Something, sure, of state, Either from Venice, or some unhatched practice Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him, Hath puddled his clear spirit, and in such cases Men’s natures wrangle with inferior things, Though great ones are their object.	shakespearean
I suspect some foul play.	modern
Searching the window for a flint, I found This paper, thus sealed up, and I am sure It did not lie there when I went to bed.	shakespearean
I wasn’t talking to any man at that time, my lord.	modern
They swore that you were sick with love for me.	modern
You lover of that damned whore, you’re talking to me of “ifs”?	modern
Even if I had a whole bunch of mouths, I wouldn’t be able to answer that.	modern
These sweet thoughts relieve me and refresh me, especially when I’m slaving away busily.	modern
But a terminal disease requires extreme treatment, or nothing at all.	modern
My lord Sebastian, even though what you say is true, your way of saying it is tactless and comes at the wrong time.	modern
My cousin’s a fool, and thou art another.	shakespearean
Let floods o'erswell and fiends for food howl on!	shakespearean
Your voice is loud and commanding, but you look like a working man.	modern
It is as easy as lying.	shakespearean
Oh, Caesar, read mine first, for my petition affects you more directly.	modern
Did he charge interest?	modern
Be brief, lest that the process of thy kindness Last longer telling than thy kindness' date.	shakespearean
Go on, wear your boots out!	modern
Stand, ho!	shakespearean
Go forth, Agrippa, and begin the fight.	shakespearean
I’ve looked at many ladies with pleasure, and been	modern
And as you know, his connections, if he put them to good use, might be enough to hurt us all.	modern
Thou stickest a dagger in me.	shakespearean
Let their beds Be made as soft as yours and let their palates Be seasoned with such viands”?	shakespearean
You think about him too much.	modern
Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you, and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny.	shakespearean
Your wife wouldn’t like it if she were here to hear you make that offer.	modern
Let them come before Master Constable.	shakespearean
Never fear that.	shakespearean
It is twice blessed: It blesseth him that gives and him that takes.	shakespearean
And if our navy wins tomorrow, no doubt our army will do their part.	modern
Avoid what is to come.	shakespearean
Slanders, sir.	shakespearean
Whilst you were here o'erwhelmèd with your grief— A passion most resulting such a man— Cassio came hither.	shakespearean
Wilt thou make a trust a transgression?	shakespearean
But are not some whole that we must make sick?	shakespearean
He, that Caliban Whom now I keep in service.	shakespearean
At dinner.	modern
Lock yourself in and send him word that you’re dead.	modern
Snap out of your daze.	modern
Let’s all sink wi' th' king.	shakespearean
I will, my lord.	shakespearean
Each new morn New widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds As if it felt with Scotland and yelled out Like syllable of dolor.	shakespearean
And leave you out?	modern
You have little cause to say so.	shakespearean
They’ve made many raids upon Italy—and the naval patrols go pale at even the thought of resisting them.	modern
In thee there is not half an hour of life.	shakespearean
Are they as popular as they used to be when I lived in the city?	modern
I’m not.	modern
But what about your guilty conscience?	modern
Or, if you borrow one another’s love for the instant, you may, when you hear no more words of Pompey, return it again.	shakespearean
If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would not prophesy so.	shakespearean

Hear a little further And then I’ll bring thee to the present business Which now ’s upon ’s, without the which this story Were most impertinent.	shakespearean
But not a member of the royal family, like me.	modern
My name’s Stephano, and I’ve come to tell you my mistress will arrive here at Belmont before sunrise.	modern
We’ve seen the best our age has to offer.	modern
You’re helping the storm, not us.	modern
Any trick that works is good for me.	modern
Have you a mind to sink?	shakespearean
The dram of evil Doth all the noble substance of a doubt To his own scandal.	shakespearean
Mars’s hot minion is returned again.	shakespearean
It is young Orlando, that tripped up the wrestler’s heels and your heart both in an instant.	shakespearean
You have loved him well.	shakespearean
I pray you, remember the porter.	shakespearean
But all the charms of love, Salt Cleopatra, soften thy wanned lip!	shakespearean
No, advancement to the dignity and height of honor, to a high, imperial kind of glory.	modern
I am not so reputed!	shakespearean
And, as the jest did glance away from me, 'Tis ten to one it maimed you two outright.	shakespearean
I must fetch his necessaries ashore.	shakespearean
Farewell content!	shakespearean
Raise all the money you can.	modern
What’s here?	shakespearean
It’s not my fault he acts like that, Helena.	modern
Goodbye, my husband.	modern
He that knows better how to tame a shrew, Now let him speak; ’tis charity to show.	shakespearean
Be kind now and tell me some excellent fortune.	modern
Let me live here forever.	modern
If he had as many lives as he’s got hairs on his head, I would’ve killed them all in revenge.	modern
Faith, her privates we.	shakespearean
O excellent young man!	shakespearean
Zounds, hold your peace.	shakespearean
The worms were hallowed that did breed the silk, And it was dyed in mummy which the skillful Conserved of maidens' hearts.	shakespearean
See that it is done, and prepare a feast for the soldiers.	modern
Good friend, be gone.	shakespearean
Marry, and did.	shakespearean
Give me some light, away!	shakespearean
Stephano is my name, and I bring word My mistress will before the break of day Be here at Belmont.	shakespearean
But you, my honorable lords, may name the time, And in the duke’s behalf I’ll give my voice, Which I presume he’ll take in gentle part.	shakespearean
Our bodies are like gardens and our willpower is like the gardener.	modern
Claim fair England’s peace depends on this alliance.	modern
Well then, go you into hell?	shakespearean
You can have anything you want.	modern
And then again, it’s not so good, but only so-so.	modern
Edward’s sons have been carried off by the angels and Anne, my wife, has bid good night to the world.	modern
I can’t wait to meet her!	modern
I’ll none now.	shakespearean
If you had foul words in your mouth, then your breath must be foul, and foul breath is nauseating.	modern
Tomorrow’s a good day.	modern
As I remember, Henry the Sixth prophesied that Richmond would be king when Richmond was only a foolish little boy.	modern
Since you know all this is true, why do you blame me for loving you?	modern
What’s the news?	modern
Sir, do you know me?	shakespearean
I’ve heard many of the noblest Romans—next to immortal Caesar—speaking of you, complaining of the tyranny of today’s government, and wishing that your eyes were working better.	modern
Be simple-answered, for we know the truth.	shakespearean
And mine say a hundred and forty.	modern
Killing pigs.	modern
Make room for Antony, most noble Antony!	modern
Good husband, come home soon.	modern
The problem is that they have to compete with a group of children who yell out their lines and receive outrageous applause for it.	modern
Give me leave, Caesar.	shakespearean
Here at the door.	shakespearean
Oh, the things men dare to do!	modern
That man always looks so sour!	modern
Being satisfied with a job well done is payment enough.	modern
Listen, but don’t speak.	modern
He who chooses me will get as much as he deserves.” As much as he deserves—wait a minute there, Morocco, and consider your own value with a level head.	modern
A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!	shakespearean
You would be committing a wicked sin by chiding other people for sinning, because you yourself have been a terrible sinner, as carnal in your appetites as lust itself, and all the swollen pustules of sin that you acquired in your freedom you now want to burst and shoot back into the world at large.	modern
Now let me see if I can translate it.	modern
I’ll give  Thank you, darling.	modern
Edward’s healing touch is a miracle that I have seen him perform many times during my stay in England.	modern
I will give treason his payment into plows, I warrant you.	shakespearean
That’s the way to do it!	modern
I’ll bring thee word Straight how ’tis like to go.	shakespearean
Pray you, sir, stand up.	shakespearean
It sounds no more, and sure, it waits upon Some god o' th' island.	shakespearean
Your answer?	modern
Therefore the Dukes of Berri and of Brittany, Of Brabant and of Orléans, shall make forth, And you, Prince Dauphin, with all swift dispatch, To line and new-repair our towns of war With men of courage and with means defendant.	shakespearean
She will sit you—you heard my daughter tell you how.	shakespearean
That day will never come.	modern
I’ll see it done.	shakespearean
Well, other men have bad luck too.	modern
Take off my mistress' gown for your master’s use!	modern
I can’t blame you, old lord.	modern
She was here even now.	shakespearean
What thou wouldst highly, That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false, And yet wouldst wrongly win.	shakespearean
That way, he’ll waste his provisions and tire out his soldiers, weakening his own capacities, while we, lying still, are rested, energetic, and nimble.	modern
You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers That bear this heavy mutual load of moan, Now cheer each other in each other’s love.	shakespearean
It’s revolting!	modern
There’s no clock in the forest.	shakespearean
Would not they speak?	shakespearean
Therefore play, music.—Prince, thou art sad.	shakespearean
I tell you, I feel very jolly remembering such a beautiful dream.	modern
Go, you wild bedfellow, you cannot soothsay.	shakespearean
Our general cast us thus early for the love of his Desdemona—who let us not therefore blame.	shakespearean
I have noted it well.	shakespearean
Nay, by 'r Lady, I am not such a fool to think what I list, nor I list not to think what I can, nor indeed I cannot think, if I would think my heart out of thinking, that you are in love or that you will be in love or that you can be in love.	shakespearean
If I find a hole in his coat, I will tell him my mind.	shakespearean
Neighbors and friends, though we don’t have anyone for the bride and bridegroom’s places at the table, you know there’s nothing missing in the feast itself.	modern
Do you find some occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking too loud, or tainting his discipline, or from what other course you please, which the time shall more favorably minister.	shakespearean
This island’s mine, by Sycorax my mother, Which thou takest from me.	shakespearean
Softly and swiftly, sir, for the priest is ready.	shakespearean
Let’s go, we’ll obey you.	modern
Why is this “impawned,” as you call it?	shakespearean
Do, good William.	shakespearean
Let him speak, my lord, Upon his peril, that I have reserved To myself nothing.	shakespearean
He doth, for he did bid Antonius Send word to you he would be there tomorrow.	shakespearean
I have a daughter named Katherina, sir.	modern
And even for that do I love you the more.	shakespearean
But that is a false conclusion, since we have locks to keep our valuables safe and clever traps to catch little thieves.	modern
I will.	modern
You’d better not wear your dagger in your cap that day, or he might slap your head with it.	modern
Why, then, tomorrow night, or Tuesday morn.	shakespearean
Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.	shakespearean
Rest easy in the meantime.	modern
I pray you, will you take him by the arm?	shakespearean
What brings him here?	modern
Good morning, neighbor Gremio.	modern
Tis well blown, lads.	shakespearean
Tis the time’s plague when madmen lead the blind.	shakespearean
You do not mind the play.	shakespearean
How answer you that?	shakespearean
No, we’ll all go there to bring him.	modern
Oh, what a villain!	modern
Let fortune and victory be yours!	modern
Thou hast obtained thy suit.	shakespearean
Horatio says we’re imagining it, and won’t let himself believe anything about this horrible thing that we’ve seen twice now.	modern
But, for your conscience?	shakespearean
Who calls?	shakespearean
No, let me know, And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.	shakespearean
Let your highness Command upon me, to the which my duties Are with a most indissoluble tie Forever knit.	shakespearean
And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love?	shakespearean
Its own color.	modern
I have locked the letter in my closet.	shakespearean
No more.	shakespearean
Cassius, go to the next street and divide the crowd.	modern
That way we can conceal how many of us there are, and Macbeth’s spies will give him inaccurate reports.	modern
Our poor father, Clarence!	modern
Why do you look like that?	modern
You piece of filth, you’re lying!	modern
Now, where’s your master?	shakespearean
Not so young, sir, to love a woman for singing, nor so old to dote on her for anything.	shakespearean
I’m afraid to think how I’ll be criticized for letting my natural affection for my father give way to my loyalty to you.	modern
Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her favors?	shakespearean
The venom of such looks, we fairly hope, Have lost their quality, and that this day Shall change all griefs and quarrels into love.	shakespearean
We must obey the time.	shakespearean
Get up and listen to me.	modern
He who is dizzy thinks the world is spinning.	modern
And why are you noble, strong, and brave?	modern
I must away this night toward Padua, And it is meet I presently set forth.	shakespearean
What dost thou mean?	shakespearean
The gates of mercy shall be all shut up, And the fleshed soldier, rough and hard of heart, In liberty of bloody hand, shall range With conscience wide as hell, mowing like grass Your fresh fair virgins and your flow'ring infants.	shakespearean
I assure you, sir, there’s nothing to be afraid of.	modern
You’ll be afraid to hear it.	modern
You’ll get there two days before me.	modern
Stay hidden and listen.	modern
He rests tonight within twenty-one miles of Rome.	modern
Is that the naked guy?	modern
I promise you your kindred hath made my eyes water ere now.	shakespearean
Are you my daughter?	modern
If you killed Lysander while he was sleeping, then you’re already up to your ankles in blood.	modern
But all remember What you have said, and show yourselves true Romans.	shakespearean
Be brave like the lion and proud.	modern
Go not my horse the better, I must become a borrower of the night For a dark hour or twain.	shakespearean
Why, then let’s home again.	shakespearean
Why had I not with charitable hand Took up a beggar’s issue at my gates, Who, smirchèd thus, and mired with infamy, I might have said, “No part of it is mine; This shame derives itself from unknown loins”?	shakespearean
But wait, what’s that sound?	modern
Until that happens, let me be who I am and don’t try to change me.	modern
Then, if ever thou dar’st acknowledge it, I will make it my quarrel.	shakespearean
Thus far with rough and all-unable pen Our bending author hath pursued the story, In little room confining mighty men, Mangling by starts the full course of their glory.	shakespearean
Nay, I am sure it is, Volumnius.	shakespearean
Let the old ruffian know I have many other ways to die, meantime Laugh at his challenge.	shakespearean
Block up my house’s ears—I mean the windows.	modern
It should work.	modern
No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.	shakespearean
Sir, please, don’t be angry.	modern
With this strange virtue, He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy, And sundry blessings hang about his throne, That speak him full of grace.	shakespearean
Methinks she should not use a long one for such a Pyramus.	shakespearean
Master, master, look about you.	shakespearean
Ay, gentle cousin, were it light enough.	shakespearean
Would you desire lime and hair to speak better?	shakespearean
The most important thing for you to think about is how beautiful his daughter is.	modern
Friends, begone.	shakespearean
Take her to my tent.	modern
Shall Caesar send a lie?	shakespearean
Yes, sir, they’re ready.	modern
You’re not thinking of leaving tonight, surely?	modern
I know him well.	modern
Why should we do this?	modern
Even so.	shakespearean
We have sworn, my lord, already.	shakespearean
Who would fardels bear, To grunt and sweat under a weary life, But that the dread of something after death, The undiscovered country from whose bourn No traveler returns, puzzles the will And makes us rather bear those ills we have Than fly to others that we know not of?	shakespearean
Do you not jest?	shakespearean
I bet I’ve been wrong about myself all this time.	modern
To put it plainly, I’m afraid I’m not quite sane.	modern
He got there too late.	modern
You won’t leave this grove until I’ve paid you back for this insult.	modern
He’s bound to Octavia.	modern
To tell you true, I counterfeit him.	shakespearean
Marry, do I, sir, and I came to acquaint you with a matter.	shakespearean
I know they do, and I certainly deserve it.	modern
What’s Pyramus?	modern
Why, what make you here?	shakespearean
He needs not.	shakespearean
I’m afraid we’re intruding too boldly on your sleep time.	modern
I’ll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders Before I’ll see the crown so foul misplaced.	shakespearean
Where we lay, Our chimneys were blown down and, as they say, Lamentings heard i' th' air, strange screams of death, And prophesying with accents terrible Of dire combustion and confused events New hatched to the woeful time.	shakespearean
I would have had thee there and here again Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.	shakespearean
Who’s there?	modern
And therefore, good Grumio, the news.	shakespearean
Ay, Casca.	shakespearean
Tell her that I, her king, am her lowly subject.	modern
No, I won’t cry any more.	modern
He who will not follow me now, let him depart and stand in the doorway like a pimp, cap in hand, while some slave, no nobler than my dog, violates his daughter.	modern
I take some joy to say you are because I would be talking of her.	shakespearean
Keep your promise, my love.	modern
Were ’t my fitness To let these hands obey my blood, They are apt enough to dislocate and tear Thy flesh and bones.	shakespearean
Oh no!	modern
You’re in a hurry, are you?	modern
I pity England, but not myself.	modern
So is he now in execution Of any bold or noble enterprise, However he puts on this tardy form.	shakespearean
So come with me.	modern
Let Rome be thus informed.	shakespearean
Give me some applause, if we’re friends, and Robin will make everything up to you.	modern
I go, my lord.	shakespearean
Why, this fellow has banished two on ’s daughters, and did the third a blessing against his will.	shakespearean
The English are in the field, French lords.	modern
Why, your lieutenant, Cassio.	shakespearean
Oh, the heavens!	shakespearean
The biggest clue is his seriousness.	modern
As I suck blood, I will some mercy show.	shakespearean
This wicked man will be brought face to face with Margaret, who I believe was hired by Don John to take part in this plot.	modern
Well, all’s one for that.	shakespearean
So fare you well at once, for Brutus' tongue Hath almost ended his life’s history.	shakespearean
The sun!	shakespearean
Doesn’t he deserve it?	modern
But, really, what’s going on, Clarence?	modern
Are you?	modern
As old and white-haired as you are, and you’re such a traitor?	modern
Do we trouble you?	shakespearean
And I must be from thence!	shakespearean
This way, my lord.	shakespearean
I prithee, good Grumio, tell me, how goes the world?	shakespearean
I am none of these, my lord.	shakespearean
Answer my life my judgment, Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least, Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound Reverbs no hollowness.	shakespearean
I cannot hope Caesar and Antony shall well greet together.	shakespearean
Good Master Mustardseed, I know your patience well.	shakespearean
Abate the edge of traitors, gracious Lord, That would reduce these bloody days again, And make poor England weep in streams of blood!	shakespearean
I have yet Room for six scotches more.	shakespearean
Let it stay in your inventory until it bankrupts you.	modern
Why are you here?	modern
Which of them shall I take?	shakespearean
What do you say, Caesar?	modern
Until then, God be with you!	modern
Nature, I don’t accuse your weather of unkindness.	modern
He that plays the king shall be welcome.	shakespearean
O, preposterous And frantic outrage, end thy damnèd spleen, Or let me die, to look on death no more.	shakespearean
But that’s just a fairy tale.	modern
Let us leave everything and give our vineyards to the barbarous nation.	modern
Pray you now, Nay, do so, for indeed I have lost command.	shakespearean
And so, without more circumstance at all, I hold it fit that we shake hands and part.	shakespearean
For you to threaten to kill me is most unlawful.	modern
Ah, he got you back, Benedick!	modern
What, with Lysander?	shakespearean
This is the air-drawn dagger which you said Led you to Duncan.	shakespearean
Let me go, or I’ll knock you on the head.	modern
Well, sir, it’s better to say little than to be tedious.	modern
I have seen you both.	shakespearean
She went from me, who loved her with the dignity and devotion that suits a legitimate marriage, to a wretch whose natural gifts were poor compared to mine.	modern
Caesar, you thought this would happen.	modern
They tell me you’ve done everything you can to talk him out of what he’s doing.	modern
By report I know him well.	shakespearean
Go thy ways to a nunnery.	shakespearean
They’re saying I’d be an animal without a heart if I stayed home today out of fear.	modern
But if you’d be willing to shoot another arrow the same way you shot the first, I’ll watch your arrow more carefully this time.	modern
But she as far surpasseth Sycorax As great’st does least.	shakespearean
Oh, heaven have mercy on me!	shakespearean
Today our hopes are at an end.	modern
We come to hate that which controls us.	modern
Grumio, my horse.	shakespearean
You love me in spite of your heart, I think.	modern
Pompey Thrives in our idleness.	shakespearean
You’ll have your nephews neigh to you.	shakespearean
Why, madam, if I were your father’s dog, You should not use me so.	shakespearean
My sons Edward and Clarence!	modern
Let th’ Egyptians And the Phoenicians go a-ducking.	shakespearean
There is no harm intended to your person, Nor to no Roman else.	shakespearean
Please call him and tell him to come back here.	modern
If not, goodbye.	modern
How now, Lorenzo?	shakespearean
A plague upon the tyrant that I serve!	shakespearean
I don’t even have one to throw at a dog.	modern
I will not stay to offend you.	shakespearean
Shouldn’t I say, “Does a dog have money?	modern
And, moreover, God saw Benedick when he was hid in the garden.	modern
It doesn’t make either of us happy, I know.	modern
I loved wine and gambling, and had more women than a Turkish sultan keeps in his harem.	modern
Age, thou art shamed!	shakespearean
We’ve advanced too far.	modern
You scoundrel!	modern
I have to pretend to threaten you with my sword.	modern
Come, sir, I am for you.	shakespearean
The more I love, the more he hateth me.	shakespearean
Nay, I pray you let me go.	shakespearean
Shame on you, Demetrius!	modern
Good to see you, Iago.	modern
It’s obvious:  Here comes Biondello.	modern
Post to Salisbury.	shakespearean
What men may do!	shakespearean
Once I’m there, I won’t need a guide anymore.	modern
Sir, he told me quite bluntly that he didn’t feel like it.	modern
But I’ll tell you something from my soul.	modern
I like the work well.	shakespearean
I don’t see any blood.	modern
They see and smell And have their palates both for sweet and sour, As husbands have.	shakespearean
Oh, are you here, Iago?	modern
If I weren’t forbidden to tell you the secrets of	modern
Upon the crown o' th' cliff, what thing was that Which parted from you?	shakespearean
And so far am I glad it so did sort, As this their jangling I esteem a sport.	shakespearean
If we meet him at Philippi, these people will be at our backs.	modern
Cheer up, Antonio!	modern
If you weren’t a man, then what kind of animal were you when you first told me you wanted to do this?	modern
Nay, but his jesting spirit, which is now crept into a lute string and now governed by stops— Indeed, that tells a heavy tale for him.	shakespearean
I speak not as in absolute fear of you.	shakespearean
What, is he angry?	shakespearean
What conquest brings he home?	shakespearean
With cunning hast thou filched my daughter’s heart, Turned her obedience (which is due to me) To stubborn harshness.—And, my gracious duke, Be it so she will not here before your grace Consent to marry with Demetrius, I beg the ancient privilege of Athens.	shakespearean
Whenever you want, since you’re the one who wants it.	modern
I pray you tell me.	shakespearean
Hazard for lead?	shakespearean
She sees you with the eyes my daughter lent her, it’s true.	modern
The sky doth frown and lour upon our army.	shakespearean
To the selfsame tune and words.	shakespearean
Your statue spouting blood through many holes, in which many smiling Romans bathed, means that you’ll provide great Rome with sustaining blood, and that great men will strive to get some token of approval from your holy blood.	modern
Do you hear us, sir?	modern
So take me to see them.	modern
Oh, here it is.	shakespearean
Are you sick?	modern
Conclude, conclude, he is in love.	shakespearean
These are the forgeries of jealousy.	shakespearean
But your words are as sweet as honey—you’ve stolen from the bees and left them with nothing.	modern
And she can weep, sir, weep.	shakespearean
Hail to you, thane of Glamis!	modern
I muse why she’s at liberty.	shakespearean
Though I wish thy death, I will not be the executioner.	shakespearean
Is Cassius nearby?	modern
They stared, and were distracted.	shakespearean
The day, my friends, and all things stay for me.	shakespearean
Her waspish-headed son has broke his arrows, Swears he will shoot no more, but play with sparrows And be a boy right out.	shakespearean
You know what, my lord?	modern
Know we this face or no?	shakespearean
But, Othello, speak.	shakespearean
Believe then, if you please, that I can do strange things.	shakespearean
Your worship was wont to tell me that I could do nothing without bidding.	shakespearean
I’m indebted to you forever.	modern
What are these warlike noises?	modern
And so it is.	shakespearean
Just now.	modern
O me, my heart, my rising heart!	shakespearean
I feel this pinprick.	modern
If it’s the same one— If it’s the same one, or any one that belongs to her, then together with the other evidence it’s pretty strong.	modern
Why, she was dead ere thou wast born.	shakespearean
Antony, it’s time to stop your wild hedonism.	modern
Dost thou hear, Iago?	shakespearean
No matter, since They have left their viands behind, for we have stomachs.	shakespearean
And thus she means, videlicet— Asleep, my love?	shakespearean
Offended us you have not, but the king.	shakespearean
A parlous boy!	shakespearean
I was talking to some Venetians down by the shore, and the fool showed up.	modern
Look up moonshine, look up moonshine!	modern
My forces are growing, and everything I know tells me it’s all coming together.	modern
Let life be short so that shame won’t last too long.	modern
And yet she cheapens herself by turning her gaze on me, who cut her sweet prince’s life short and made her a widow?	modern
But his ambition—for that, I killed him.	modern
Not very well, but I have met him oft, And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds That the old carlot once was master of.	shakespearean
I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet.	shakespearean
If you’ve been ordered back to Venice because of my father, don’t blame me.	modern
When I know the gentleman, I’ll tell him what you say.	shakespearean
Crude slaves with greasy aprons, rulers, and hammers shall lift us up so everyone can see.	modern
Change you color?	shakespearean
What does he say about Brutus?	modern
I am in your debt for your last exercise.	shakespearean
I will have my revenge ere I depart his house.	shakespearean
Of one not easily jealous, but being wrought, Perplexed in the extreme.	shakespearean
Nay, then thou lov’st it not And all my pains is sorted to no proof.	shakespearean
Who wants to buy the flock and the pasture?	modern
Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.	shakespearean
Oh, Isis, that’s impossible.	modern
Here comes two of the banished duke’s pages.	shakespearean
The enemy is making its appearance on the battlefield.	modern
All my reports go with the modest truth, Nor more, nor clipped, but so.	shakespearean
Mistress and master, you have oft inquired After the shepherd that complained of love, Who you saw sitting by me on the turf, Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess That was his mistress.	shakespearean
If you knew the reason, you’d understand and would urge me to go rather than stay.	modern
As I did stand my watch upon the hill, I looked toward Birnam, and anon methought The wood began to move.	shakespearean
Me neither, my lord.	modern
But my dear, when I said I was worth nothing, I was actually bragging—I should’ve said that I was worse than nothing.	modern
He said once the devil would have him about women.	shakespearean
Oh, let their bodies follow, my dear king, to win back what’s rightfully yours with blood and sword and fire.	modern
How many things by season seasoned are To their right praise and true perfection!	shakespearean
Our handwriting gives away our hearts.	modern
Come with me.	modern
May I speak, Caesar.	modern
My first question for Nerissa is whether she’d rather wait till tomorrow night or go to bed now, since there are only two more hours till morning.	modern
Commend me to him and tell him I will not fail him at supper, for indeed he hath made great preparation.	shakespearean
But there’s more work.	shakespearean
Oh, well-a-day, Lady!	shakespearean
Where’s my father?	modern
He has come to kill my heart.	modern
Oh, thereby hangs a tail.	shakespearean
O, make them joyful.	shakespearean
Woe, woe for England!	shakespearean
Is the king awake, worthy thane?	modern
I feel a lot better after talking to this guy.	modern
Is she as tall as me?	shakespearean
So hurry up, because we have twenty miles to cover today.	modern
If it be not for some purpose of import, Give ’t me again.	shakespearean
Here comes Ancient Pistol and his wife.	shakespearean
When I desire their leave that I might pity him, they took from me the use of mine own house, charged me on pain of their perpetual displeasure neither to speak of him, entreat for him, nor any way sustain him.	shakespearean
It seems to me that your voice has changed, and that your speech is more elegant than it used to be.	modern
Really, my lord, I don’t know what to make of it, but she loves him with such a passion that it’s past all understanding.	modern
Very well, madam.	shakespearean
His insane period is over.	modern
Fare thee well at once.	shakespearean
Don’t say no.	modern
Come on, you and I will go soon.	modern
The name of Cassius gives credit to these corrupt actions, and so they go unpunished.	modern
How lush and lusty the grass looks!	shakespearean
Lay on, Macduff, And damned be him that first cries, “Hold, enough!” I would the friends we miss were safe arrived.	shakespearean
A tiny spot of evil casts doubt on their good qualities and ruins their reputations.	modern
I am not merry, but I do beguile The thing I am by seeming otherwise.	shakespearean
Come, uncle Exeter, enter Harfleur.	modern
There were enough Christians before—as many of them as could stand to live near each other.	modern
I said so, dear Katherine, and I’m not ashamed to repeat it.	modern
O lady, speak again!	shakespearean
Make it no wonder.	shakespearean
Are you on duty again tonight?	modern
Sit thee down, Clitus.	shakespearean
What, art thou afraid?	shakespearean
And now she’ll start moaning, of course— Are you asleep, my love?	modern
Are you not good?	shakespearean
And seemed I ever otherwise to you?	shakespearean
But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?	shakespearean
He’s a stylish man.	modern
If your master Would have a queen his beggar, you must tell him, That majesty, to keep decorum, must No less beg than a kingdom.	shakespearean
Do you confess so much?	shakespearean
The king and prince at prayers.	shakespearean
D'elbow.”      “D'elbow,”    “De nick,”  “De nick.”  “De chin.” “De sin.”	shakespearean
I’ve got to go.	modern
You shall have anything.	shakespearean
Not see him since?	shakespearean
You could never do him so ill-well unless you were the very man.	shakespearean
Is this your idea of success?	modern
That’s just how he is.	modern
She’s beautiful, if my eyes can see.	modern
Was someone as beautiful as you meant to be a whore?	modern
There was a time when I would have been terrified by a shriek in the night, and the hair on my skin would have stood up when I heard a ghost story.	modern
He lies to th' heart.	shakespearean
My father loved Sir Rowland as much as he loved his own soul, and the rest of the world shared my father’s opinion.	modern
For often, with a solemn earnestness— More than indeed belonged to such a trifle— He begged of me to steal it.	shakespearean
Aren’t things going well?	modern
Where is the evidence that doth accuse me?	shakespearean
By this leek, I swear I’ll make you pay for this.	modern
Hence his ambition growing— Dost thou hear?	shakespearean
Charmian, hark.	shakespearean
I sent the French queen with him too, for the same reason.	modern
Oh, that brave Caesar!	shakespearean
This is all that’s left for me to do, but I won’t do it.	modern
I will accept no apology until experts in matters of honor show me how to make peace with you without staining my own reputation in doing so.	modern
Out of these convertites There is much matter to be heard and learned.	shakespearean
I will the banner from a trumpet take And use it for my haste.	shakespearean
What, like stuff from a house?	modern
Most formidable Queen!	modern
Her ladies-in-waiting saw her go to bed, and early this morning the bed was empty.	modern
We will be married o' Sunday.	shakespearean
Was it not yesterday we spoke together?	shakespearean
I call thee not.	shakespearean
Because when rich villains need poor villains' services, those poor ones can name the price.	modern
Take it off and throw it on the ground.	modern
Lovers, it’s time to go to bed.	modern
He says for Brutus' sake He finds himself beholding to us all.	shakespearean
My lord it shall be done.	shakespearean
If it pleases your Majesty, let his neck pay the price, if there is any martial law in the world.	modern
Well, good luck to them tonight in bed!	modern
We all expect a nice answer from you, Jew.	modern
Endless greed and lust in a man’s nature is a kind of tyranny.	modern
It must be.	modern
My father compounded with my mother under the dragon’s tail and my nativity was under Ursa Major, so that it follows I am rough and lecherous.	shakespearean
When they are in great danger, I recover them.	shakespearean
The lark shrilly singing up there is too far away to be heard.	modern
And so, beautiful lady, I’m standing here just like that, wondering whether all this can be true until you tell me it is.	modern
By heavens, the duke shall know how slack you have been.	shakespearean
C’mon, I might as well say the fool’s the fool!	modern
No more a soldier.	shakespearean
He calls us back.	shakespearean
Madam, how like you this play?	shakespearean
If I do live, I will be good to thee.	shakespearean
Then know that from my soul I love your daughter.	modern
Treat them with honor and dignity.	modern
Thou dar’st as well be hanged.	shakespearean
Pompey has a strong navy.	modern
I think it was to see my mother’s wedding.	shakespearean
But soft, behold!	shakespearean
With that, I hope God is with him!	modern
Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty, For in my youth I never did apply Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo The means of weakness and debility.	shakespearean
Let’s meet him and receive him.	shakespearean
Here, sir!” You loggerheaded and unpolished grooms!	shakespearean
Yes, but these English are seriously short of beef.	modern
Oh, my lord, you once said that lazy weeds grow fast.	modern
Why is that cauldron sinking?	modern
How now, my sweet Bianca!	shakespearean
No, Caesar shall not.	shakespearean
Young gentleman, you are too bold for your age.	modern
You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is—	shakespearean
He can’t speak, my lord.	modern
Sir, you’re old.	modern
Oh, heaven, how got she out?	shakespearean
I can.	modern
He was disposed to mirth, but on the sudden A Roman thought hath struck him.—Enobarbus!	shakespearean
Sir, a word ere you go.	shakespearean
Come with me, Silvius.	modern
You admit it, then?	modern
Here, madam.	shakespearean
What handkerchief?	shakespearean
Are they not now upon the western shore, Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships?	shakespearean
Strike the vessels, ho!	shakespearean
I know her by her walk.	modern
Didst perceive?	shakespearean
How did he look?	modern
I’m afraid you’ve sold your own land to see other men’s.	modern
But when  You take up your duties too cheerfully.	modern
I’ll make so bold to call, For ’tis my limited service.	shakespearean
But what about the bloody handkerchief?	modern
Pray you, hasten Your generals after.	shakespearean
Well, more anon.—Comes the king forth, I pray you?	shakespearean
Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!	shakespearean
Please, marry us.	modern
Thy eyes are almost set in thy head.	shakespearean
Let it go up to heaven.	modern
By watching their show, you’ll find out everything you’re likely to know.	modern
Please, uncle, let’s go in and ask your daughters to forgive you.	modern
But when push comes to shove, they droop like those horses that are all show and slow to a crawl.	modern
But even so, we can’t do without him.	modern
Thou shalt serve me.	shakespearean
I may say “thrusting” it, For piercing steel and darts envenomèd Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus As tidings of this sight.	shakespearean
O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou didst know how many fathom deep I am in love.	shakespearean
I’ll read the writing.	shakespearean
Harpier cries, “'Tis time, ’tis time.” Round about the cauldron go, In the poisoned entrails throw.	shakespearean
I have it, Tranio!	shakespearean
She is herself a dowry.	shakespearean
Everyone else, march on with me.	modern
I’ve sent twenty people to look for you.	modern
I thank you all.	modern
Persever, counterfeit sad looks, Make mouths upon me when I turn my back, Wink each at other, hold the sweet jest up— This sport, well carried, shall be chronicled.	shakespearean
I reasoned with a Frenchman yesterday, Who told me, in the narrow seas that part The French and English, there miscarried A vessel of our country richly fraught.	shakespearean
Was ever woman in this humor won?	shakespearean
As good a wife as she is, that’s how good a husband I am to you.	modern
I’ve changed my mind about that.	modern
No, he means you’ll use makeup when you’re old.	modern
But I won’t shed any of her blood or scar that beautiful skin, whiter than snow and smooth as the finest marble.	modern
Today was the day I breathed my first breath.	modern
They have wings.	modern
His Honor and myself are at the one, And at the other is my good friend Catesby, Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us Whereof I shall not have intelligence.	shakespearean
That’s how it was with Henry the Sixth, who was crowned in Paris when he was only nine months old.	modern
And she’s obedient, as you say, obedient, Very obedient.—Proceed you in your tears.— Concerning this, sir—Oh, well-painted passion!— I am commanded home.—Get you away, I’ll send for you anon.—Sir, I obey the mandate And will return to Venice.—Hence, avaunt!	shakespearean
Blow the trumpet!	modern
Oh, what a wonderful new world, that has such people in it!	modern
No, I don’t, sir.	modern
Those men you just mentioned will be beheaded today.	modern
He is a noble prisoner!	modern
Young man, your father’s dead.	modern
Farewell, my lord.	shakespearean
Did I deserve no more than a fool’s head?	shakespearean
Sirs, take up the corse.	shakespearean
How could you ask?	modern
Let me lick thy shoe.	shakespearean
Then everything must really be finished.	modern
The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you.	shakespearean
A sister I bequeath you whom no brother Did ever love so dearly.	shakespearean
I had rather be a dog and bay the moon Than such a Roman.	shakespearean
Go on.	modern
I felt like skipping school, sir.	modern
Well, that is the dowry of his wife; ’tis none of his own getting.	shakespearean
I will not leave him now till Cassio Be called to him.—How is ’t with you, my lord?	shakespearean
So, so, so, so!	shakespearean
Stand aside.	shakespearean
So tell me, Grumio, how goes the world?	modern
Come with me.	modern
Ratcliffe, my lord, ’tis I.	shakespearean
O notable strumpet!	shakespearean
If we do, it’ll drive us crazy.	modern
Oh, what an excellent thing this learning is!	modern
And now you’re asking for money.	modern
So young and so cruel?	modern
Well, how nice, a riddle!	modern
But I thank God that I failed in my scheme, and I rejoice in paying the penalty, as I beg God and you to pardon me.	modern
Merciful God!	modern
That I might sleep out this great gap of time My Antony is away.	shakespearean
On my life I swear to you that your youngest daughter doesn’t love you least.	modern
You think it’s a big deal that this fierce storm is soaking me to the skin.	modern
You’re not asleep yet, sir?	modern
I’m all right.	modern
What did you mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now?	shakespearean
Thou shalt not from this grove Till I torment thee for this injury.— My gentle Puck, come hither.	shakespearean
She speaks daggers, and every word stabs.	modern
Here is a place reserved, sir.	shakespearean
Your Grace heard their saccharine words, but didn’t take note of their poisonous intentions.	modern
Orlando sends his regards to you both, and he sends this bloody handkerchief to the boy he calls “his Rosalind.” Is that you?	modern
He was perfect in everything.	modern
If thou consider rightly of the matter, Caesar has had great wrong.	shakespearean
Was that done like Cassius?	shakespearean
Go you down that way towards the Capitol.	shakespearean
Well, that’s what the wife brings to the marriage.	modern
Why so, being gone,      Why so, being gone, I am a man again.	shakespearean
How does lieutenant Cassio?	shakespearean
Everyone knows where a wasp wears its stinger.	modern
So, thank God, there is no real need for me, as I wouldn’t be able to help you much.	modern
He has no friends except those who are too afraid to defy him.	modern
The rest of my life will be nothing but bitterness.	modern
My brother is imprisoned because of you, I am disgraced, and the nobility are held in contempt while those who two days ago weren’t worth a dime have suddenly been promoted.	modern
Is it so, countrymen?	shakespearean
Yes, please tell me.	modern
Why not?	modern
Listen to me, you traitor.	modern
I’ll be off before you are.	modern
I am not guilty of Lysander’s blood.	shakespearean
After a little while, I’ll beat him too.	modern
Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.” You shall look fairer ere I give or hazard.	shakespearean
No man born from a woman will ever defeat you.” So get out of here, disloyal thanes, and join the weak and decadent English!	modern
I didn’t do anything.	modern
Shall we to th' court?	shakespearean
And I mine.	shakespearean
I am not sorry neither.	shakespearean
I will unto Venice To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding day.	shakespearean
I would not be mad.	shakespearean
Come, here’s some sauce to go with it.	modern
Did he not rather Discredit my authority with yours, And make the wars alike against my stomach, Having alike your cause?	shakespearean
You were tricked into fighting, Gloucester.	modern
My freedom.	modern
O Cassius, if you could But win the noble Brutus to our party— Be you content.	shakespearean
All right then.	modern
He hasn’t done anything to harm you yet.	modern
Were ’t twenty of the greatest tributaries That do acknowledge Caesar, should I find them So saucy with the hand of she here—what’s her name Since she was Cleopatra?	shakespearean
Oh, my poor Rosalind, where will you go?	modern
Goodbye, gentlemen.	modern
What hath he said?	shakespearean
The fractured world, in its confusion, should send lions into the city streets and humans into the wilderness to live in lions’ dens.	modern
Three times today my foot-cloth horse did stumble, And started when he looked upon the Tower, As loath to bear me to the slaughterhouse.	shakespearean
Let’s stay and watch.	modern
Are your men searching for him?	modern
The wiser the woman, the wilder.	modern
And what say’st thou then to my love?	shakespearean
Tell me but truly—but then speak the truth— Do you not love my sister?	shakespearean
Hey, you!	modern
We’re friends!	modern
If you go outside, arm yourself.	modern
What is a man If his chief good and market of his time Be but to sleep and feed?	shakespearean
That’s him.	modern
I had as lief be wooed of a snail.	shakespearean
Take thy fair hour, Laertes.	shakespearean
Do you hear that, men?	modern
You know me too well.	modern
It means being faithful and ready to serve, just like I am for Phoebe.	modern
Does anyone here know who I am?	modern
Has he asked for me?	modern
What about you?	modern
I knew a girl who was married in an afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to stuff a rabbit.	modern
Well, well, We shall thrive now.—Seest thou, my good fellow?	shakespearean
Your Grace attended to their sugared words But looked not on the poison of their hearts.	shakespearean
Sir, this is the truth: you and the rest—all the people who have ever talked about her—have all been wrong.	modern
Thank you.	modern
There would this monster make a man.	shakespearean
Decius, well urged.	shakespearean
We’ll come with you, your Grace.	modern
In exchange, give up your claim to love Helena, since I love her and will love her until I die.	modern
Send Thy token of reprieve.	shakespearean
If everyone looked so lovely in their sorrow, then sorrow would be highly prized.	modern
Unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor, bare, forked animal as thou art.—  Off, off, you lendings!	shakespearean
Great business must be wrought ere noon.	shakespearean
Hath not a Jew eyes?	shakespearean
If you’ll patch a quarrel, As matter whole you have to make it with, It must not be with this.	shakespearean
Have done thy charm, thou hateful, withered hag.	shakespearean
I’ll meet you at your tent.	modern
In his tail.	shakespearean
Now we wear the wreaths of victory on our heads.	modern
In faith, my lord, not I.	shakespearean
Heaven me such uses send, Not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend!	shakespearean
I know by that same eye there’s some good news.	shakespearean
Anyway, how are you, Jessica?	modern
He doesn’t seem to be alive.	modern
Come apace, good Audrey.	shakespearean
I confess the cape.	shakespearean
I’ll go join him there, going down deeper than any anchor ever sank, and lie with him dead in the mud.	modern
This morning are they fled away and gone, And in their steads do ravens, crows, and kites Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us As we were sickly prey.	shakespearean
I think that Macedon is indeed where Alexander was born.	modern
We’re ready if our minds are ready.	modern
It is so.	shakespearean
Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there, That kills and pains not?	shakespearean
Shall they see us?	shakespearean
The devil speaks in him.	shakespearean
But I will tell you that lately the duke has been displeased with his niece, and for no other reason than that people praise her virtues and pity her for her father’s sake.	modern
We will go together.	shakespearean
Isn’t that true?	modern
Thou art too like the spirit of Banquo.	shakespearean
Here I am at your service, my dear lord.	modern
A lot of words.	modern
Error i' the bill, sir, error i' the bill!	shakespearean
Now, sir, what make you here?	shakespearean
Oh, falsely, falsely murdered!	shakespearean
I could go on weeping like a woman and bragging about how I will avenge them!	modern
Come on, woo me, woo me.	modern
Alas, our poor country!	modern
Not at all!	modern
Bring him silently.	shakespearean
Therefore the sadness is without limit.	shakespearean
Cassio did top her, ask thy husband else.	shakespearean
This is his second fit like this.	modern
Why, so I did, but looked for no reply.	shakespearean
Is he crazy with love for you?	modern
Tell our top commanders that I want tomorrow’s battle to be the last we fight.	modern
I’m not marvelous, sir, but I’m certainly a maiden.	modern
Princes and counts!	modern
O God, Horatio, what a wounded name, Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!	shakespearean
May you die of the worst disease!	modern
Bid him levy straight The greatest strength and power that he can make And meet me suddenly at Salisbury.	shakespearean
Nature wants stuff To vie strange forms with fancy, yet t’ imagine An Antony were nature’s piece ’gainst fancy, Condemning shadows quite.	shakespearean
To thee I do commend my watchful soul, Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes.	shakespearean
I must go with you to Belmont.	shakespearean
Well, I say no.	shakespearean
I know you could not lack, I am certain on ’t, Very necessity of this thought, that I, Your partner in the cause ’gainst which he fought, Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars Which fronted mine own peace.	shakespearean
No, my lord, I didn’t see anything.	modern
If you deny it, let the danger light Upon your charter and your city’s freedom.	shakespearean
Oh, how silly we are!	modern
His word is more than the miraculous harp.	shakespearean
I don’t have anywhere to go, so I don’t need to see.	modern
How now, Horatio?	shakespearean
What, An advocate for an imposter?	shakespearean
Still be kind And eke out our performance with your mind.	shakespearean
If I do not love her, I am a Jew.	shakespearean
Oh, if only my smiles could inspire love as effectively as your frowns!	modern
So do our vulgar drench their peasant limbs In blood of princes, and the wounded steeds Fret fetlock deep in gore, and with wild rage Yerk out their armèd heels at their dead masters, Killing them twice.	shakespearean
It was his bidding.	shakespearean
Who’s taken over the watch for you?	modern
Meantime, but think how I may do thee good, And be inheritor of thy desire.	shakespearean
We should have met you By sea and land, supplying every stage With an augmented greeting.	shakespearean
I will go out.	modern
Past all expressing.	shakespearean
Who would not have his wife so?	shakespearean
Well, let him go.	shakespearean
I’ve lost so much weight worrying about my losses have that I’ll hardly have a pound of flesh to spare for my bloody creditor tomorrow.—Well, jailer, let’s go.—I hope to God that Bassanio comes to see me pay his debt.	modern
Nay, an thou canst not smile as the wind sits, thou'lt catch cold shortly.	shakespearean
Mine’s not an idle cause.	shakespearean
A fox when one has caught her And such a daughter Should sure to the slaughter, If my cap would buy a halter.	shakespearean
Son, I’ll be your half Bianca comes.	shakespearean
How are you, soldier?	modern
Oh God, he’s murdered his master!	modern
Yes, like that.	modern
Okay, so that’s when he’ll say we stabbed him in his sleep.	modern
The forests, the skies, the mountains, everything around us seemed to echo the barks of the hounds.	modern
I just saw him yesterday,” or “the other day,” or whenever it is, you know, “and there he was gambling,” or “there he was, totally wasted, or fighting with somebody about a tennis match, or going into a house of ill repute”—that means a whorehouse, you know—or whatever.	modern
I’d rather get a husband from your father.	modern
These couchings and these lowly courtesies Might fire the blood of ordinary men And turn preordinance and first decree Into the law of children.	shakespearean
And I, delivering you, am satisfied, And therein do account myself well paid.	shakespearean
Keep up your courage, man!	modern
If there come truth from them— As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine— Why, by the verities on thee made good, May they not be my oracles as well, And set me up in hope?	shakespearean
As I am Egypt’s queen, Thou blushest, Antony, and that blood of thine Is Caesar’s homager.	shakespearean
To you I am bound for life and education.	shakespearean
Why, Gloucester, Gloucester, I’d speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife.	shakespearean
How are you, Hamlet?	modern
An you lie, sirrah, we’ll have you whipped.	shakespearean
Good my liege— Peace, Kent.	shakespearean
Greetings, Caesar, my lord!	modern
Where is he?	shakespearean
It is a creature That dotes on Cassio, as ’tis the strumpet’s plague To beguile many and be beguiled by one.	shakespearean
Why then, ’tis good to be a post.	shakespearean
More to know Did never meddle with my thoughts.	shakespearean
The owl made noise all night.	modern
Pray you, tell him I am his fortune’s vassal, and I send him The greatness he has got.	shakespearean
Too bad about the son!	modern
The queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.	shakespearean
She was fickle and unfaithful, like water.	modern
Where would Othello go?—Oh, look at you!	modern
I can’t live by pretending anymore.	modern
I’ll be your foil, Laertes.	shakespearean
Then I hope night shadows your day, and death takes your life!	modern
As I learned, The night before there was no purpose in them Of this remove.	shakespearean
Away, go away!	shakespearean
Why should that name be proclaimed more than yours?	modern
Come, wherefore should you be so pashful?	shakespearean
What dangers are you trying to lead me into, Cassius, that you want me to look inside myself for something that’s not there?	modern
Sit down for a while, and we’ll tell you again the story you don’t want to believe, about what we’ve seen two nights now.	modern
Now he importunes him To tell it o'er.	shakespearean
You haven’t seen him since?	modern
I never felt it till now—Two thousand ducats in that, and other precious, precious jewels.	shakespearean
I have to go to England, don’t you know that?	modern
Claribel, his daughter.	modern
Soldier, thou art; but his whole action grows Not in the power on ’t.	shakespearean
I swear, he’ll be food for the crows soon.	modern
Love cools off, friendships break up, and brothers become enemies.	modern
Nine or ten times I wanted to stab him under the ribs.	modern
I plan to fall into the blackest despair.	modern
I’ll mark the play.	shakespearean
Woe to the land that’s governed by a child.	shakespearean
Great God of heaven, say amen to all this!	modern
You are welcome.	shakespearean
More knocking.	shakespearean
Jailer, watch out for this one.	modern
No more than my residing here at Rome Might be to you in Egypt.	shakespearean
Though to have her and death were both one thing.	shakespearean
Away, and mock the time with fairest show.	shakespearean
He never did anything in his whole life that looked as good as the way he died.	modern
Though the truth of your treachery is as plain as black on white, I can scarcely believe it, it’s so past understanding.	modern
Good Lord, what a clown you are!	modern
We are fortunate in the change.	modern
Don’t worry, I couldn’t care less.	modern
No place will please me so, no mean of death, As here by Caesar, and by you cut off, The choice and master spirits of this age.	shakespearean
Tell me, thou villain-slave, where are my children?	shakespearean
If she confess that she was half the wooer, Destruction on my head if my bad blame Light on the man.—Come hither, gentle mistress.	shakespearean
Yes, she’s young and tender.	modern
And fair words to them.	shakespearean
We must die, Messala.	shakespearean
The two of us together will sing like birds in a cage.	modern
But don’t keep wondering without more proof.	modern
Go get it ready.	shakespearean
Talk you of killing?	shakespearean
If you outstay the time, upon mine honor And in the greatness of my word, you die.	shakespearean
Mistake no more.	shakespearean
I grant you.	shakespearean
I hear that Edgar, Gloucester’s exiled son, is with the Earl of Kent in Germany.	modern
They call this “the argumentative countercheck.” And so on through “the circumstantial lie” and “the direct lie.” And how many times did you say his beard wasn’t cut well?	modern
Do you acknowledge the contract?	modern
I’m sure everything will be fine.	modern
Also, you’re supposed to visit all the bars and tell anyone who’s drunk to go home and go to bed.	modern
Come, sit down, every mother’s son, and rehearse your parts.—Pyramus, you begin.	shakespearean
But gods, you give us faults so we’ll be human.	modern
Have you writ down that they are none?	shakespearean
I’ll always be loyal to you, sir.	modern
So take her, shepherd, and God bless you.	modern
If not, adieu.	shakespearean
I am content.	shakespearean
On thy love, I charge thee.	shakespearean
The man who tells a lie and swears by it is now considered as brave as Hercules.	modern
Made you my guardians, my depositaries, But kept a reservation to be followed With such a number.	shakespearean
This is a classic example of the idiocy of the world: when we’re down and out—often because of our own excesses —we put all the blame on the sun, the moon, and the stars, as if they forced us to be bad, or the heavens compelled us to be villainous or stupid.	modern
This seen, Orlando did approach the man And found it was his brother, his elder brother.	shakespearean
Wilt break my heart?	shakespearean
I think it be.	shakespearean
He is, my lord, and safe in Leicester town, Whither, if it please you, we may now withdraw us.	shakespearean
You can see for yourself.	modern
Amen to that, from the bottom of my heart.	modern
I don’t know her, but I know her father and he knew mine well.	modern
Cast spells with them, and “Brutus” will call up a ghost as well as “Caesar.” Now, in the name of all the gods, I ask you what food does Caesar eat that has made him grow so great?	modern
They have me tied to a stake.	modern
What sights, my lord?	shakespearean
Caesar hath sent—                                        Too slow a messenger.	shakespearean
It’s a very pleasing night to honest men.	modern
By this sword, he that makes the first thrust, I’ll kill him.	shakespearean
As thou art to thyself.	shakespearean
Please, be cheerful.	modern
They that have done this deed are honorable.	shakespearean
I set him there, sir, but his own disorders Deserved much less advancement.	shakespearean
An old Italian fox is not so kind, my boy.	shakespearean
Is ’t not the king?	shakespearean
Have you come from Bellario’s office in Padua?	modern
It is not day.	shakespearean
Oh, oh!	modern
It’ll go away.	modern
To whom?	modern
If arguing makes us sweat, the real trial will turn that water to blood.	modern
You want me to copy the embroidery pattern?	modern
Well this was Signor Benedick that said so.	shakespearean
Oh, let us yet be merciful.	shakespearean
There he is at the window.	modern
Oh yes, three thousand ducats.	modern
Amen to that.	modern
I’d better not drink now.	modern
By heaven, you do me wrong!	shakespearean
Did you send for him, sir?	modern
Pray you lead on.	shakespearean
In fact, I consider ambition to be so light and airy that it’s only the shadow of a shadow.	modern
You do assist the storm.	shakespearean
Good Hermia, please don’t act so bitter toward me.	modern
Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it Unless he live until he be a man.	shakespearean
The Duke of Cornwall, my master and patron, is arriving tonight.	modern
What news?	shakespearean
Your light dulls when he is near.	modern
No, some of it is about my child’s father.	modern
Though that the queen on special cause is here, Her army is moved on.	shakespearean
A ghost, a ghost!	modern
It is not very strange.	shakespearean
So I’d like it copied.	modern
I was a fine fool to take it.	shakespearean
At nine i' th' morning here we’ll meet again.	shakespearean
Methinks I could not die anywhere so contented as in the king’s company, his cause being just and his quarrel honorable.	shakespearean
