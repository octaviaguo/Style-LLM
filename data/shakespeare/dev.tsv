Next time God sends out a shipment of hair, I hope he gives you a beard!	modern
Yet, when I saw it last, it was besmeared As black as Vulcan in the smoke of war.	shakespearean
Goodbye, you beautiful, cruel woman.	modern
My lord acts just as crazy with love as you do.	modern
I know a lot about the love women can feel for men.	modern
Hurt him in eleven places.	shakespearean
Wow, we’re really going to drive him crazy.	modern
I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a barren rascal.	shakespearean
Come hither, Fabian.	shakespearean
Look where the youngest wren of nine comes.	shakespearean
Slid, I’ll after him again and beat him.	shakespearean
Just think, I could be Count Malvolio!	modern
I had rather than forty pound I were at home.	shakespearean
I can tell thee where that saying was born, of “I fear no colors.”  Where, good Mistress Mary?	shakespearean
Dear God, thank you!	modern
Well, Jove, not I, is the doer of this, and he is to be thanked.	shakespearean
Hello, sir.	modern
Here, take the ring.	modern
Oh, that I served that lady And might not be delivered to the world, Till I had made mine own occasion mellow, What my estate is.	shakespearean
Accost, Sir Andrew, accost.	shakespearean
Good, i' faith.	shakespearean
A mellifluous voice, as I am true knight.	shakespearean
I would exult, man.	shakespearean
No, sir.	modern
Who does beguile you?	shakespearean
If not, an it would please you to take leave of her, she is very willing to bid you farewell.	shakespearean
Shut up, you troublemaker, no more of that.	modern
She said if she were interested in someone, it would be someone who looked like me.	modern
I’ll help you, Sir Toby, because we’ll be dressed together.	shakespearean
I defy lechery.	shakespearean
Stay, I prithee, tell me what thou thinkest of me.	shakespearean
If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt, you have hurt me.	shakespearean
He must be possessed by the devil.	modern
Just imagine some lady might exist who loves you as powerfully and agonizingly as you love Olivia.	modern
If thou entertainest my love, let it appear in thy smiling.	shakespearean
He’ll tell you more of the story.	modern
Most certain.	shakespearean
I would’ve given it to you this morning, but a madman’s letters aren’t Gospel, so it doesn’t matter much if I’m a bit late.	modern
I will be strange, stout, in yellow stockings, and cross-gartered, even with the swiftness of putting on.	shakespearean
But there was a rumor—you know, people always gossip about royalty—that he was in love with the beautiful Olivia.	modern
That’s all one: has hurt me, and there’s the end on ’t.	shakespearean
Were you a woman, as the rest goes even, I should my tears let fall upon your cheek And say “Thrice-welcome, drownèd Viola!” My father had a mole upon his brow.	shakespearean
So I’ll be forced to call you a jerk, Sir Andrew.	modern
Lady Olivia will have you executed for not showing up.	modern
Excellent good, i' faith.	shakespearean
Tis with him in standing water, between boy and man.	shakespearean
I don’t know, madam.	modern
Nothing but this: your true love for my master.	shakespearean
Take this.	modern
That most ingrateful boy there by your side From the rude sea’s enraged and foamy mouth Did I redeem.	shakespearean
You must have figured out who I am.	modern
Close the garden door and leave me alone to hear his message.	modern
Nothing is what it is.	modern
I wish you’d do what I ask!	modern
Are you trying to make fun of me?	modern
Well then, improve your situation with a show of courage.	modern
I’ll give ’t him.	shakespearean
Wherefore are these things hid?	shakespearean
That defense thou hast, betake thee to ’t.	shakespearean
Back you shall not to the house, unless you undertake that with me which with as much safety you might answer him.	shakespearean
I will be free from thee.	shakespearean
Can you do it?	shakespearean
My niece shall take note of it, and assure thyself, there is no love-broker in the world can more prevail in man’s commendation with woman than report of valor.	shakespearean
Tis too late to go to bed now.	shakespearean
Tut, there’s life in ’t, man.	shakespearean
I swear on my life I won’t tell your secret.	modern
Hang on a minute, here’s some money for you.	modern
Keep myself?	modern
I’ll give it to him.	modern
Let’s to bed, knight.	shakespearean
Sir Topas, Sir Topas, good Sir Topas, go to my lady— Out, hyperbolical fiend!	shakespearean
If one knight give a— Would you have a love song or a song of good life?	shakespearean
Hide behind the boxwood hedge, all three of you.	modern
Listen, I’m going home tomorrow, Sir Toby.	modern
You’re wrong about that, I assure you.	modern
If he cannot, let the botcher mend him.	shakespearean
Get him to bed, and let his hurt be looked to.	shakespearean
Well, come again tomorrow.	shakespearean
I wish you all the best.	modern
I promise.	modern
Well, my friends praise me and make me look like an idiot, while my enemies tell me straightforwardly that I am an idiot.	modern
Fool, I’ll requite it in the highest degree.	shakespearean
It’s as all-consuming and insatiable as the sea, and it can swallow as much as the sea can.	modern
Just a man, like any other.	modern
Most excellent accomplished lady, the heavens rain odors on you!	shakespearean
Nay, then I must have an ounce or two of this malapert blood from you.	shakespearean
He couldn’t see you.	modern
Who’s the ruler here?	modern
My remembrance is very free and clear from any image of offense done to any man.	shakespearean
It is no matter how witty, so it be eloquent and full of invention.	shakespearean
What are you going to do now?	modern
Or I’ll deliver your insults to his face.	modern
Be that thou know’st thou art, and then thou art As great as that thou fear’st.	shakespearean
You can ride him easily, and he responds well when you pull the reins.	modern
You do Stay, Please, tell me what you think of me.	modern
If I didn’t have so many enemies in Orsino’s court, I’d go join you there.	modern
I’m going to Count Orsino’s court.	modern
Here comes the little villain herself.	modern
Jove and my stars be praised!	shakespearean
I am the only daughter in my father’s family, and all the brothers too—but I’m not completely sure about that.	modern
Soft, soft!	shakespearean
What think you of this fool, Malvolio?	shakespearean
Does she?	modern
For him, I think not on him.	shakespearean
Let the garden door be shut, and leave me to my hearing.	shakespearean
I know his soul is in heaven, fool.	shakespearean
Gentleness is the only way to go—gently, gently.	modern
A good fool.	modern
Here, madam, at your service.	shakespearean
I’ll stay a month longer.	shakespearean
I’ll do it.	modern
I can’t love him.	modern
But that’s not part of what I’m supposed to say.	modern
You have said, sir.	shakespearean
I care not for good life.	shakespearean
His indignation derives itself out of a very competent injury.	shakespearean
He hath known you but three days, and already you are no stranger.	shakespearean
Hunting what, Curio?	modern
Well then, sing a lullaby to your generosity: it’ll nap until I come back.	modern
No, the legs and thighs.	modern
But don’t think I’m doing this because I’m greedy.	modern
But as well?	shakespearean
He called me Sebastian.	modern
Is ’t possible?	shakespearean
Yes, sir, we’re part of her entourage.	modern
Good fool, good jester, I’ll make it worth your while if you get me a candle, and a pen, ink and paper.	modern
But I’ll get you a candle and paper and ink.	modern
Come along with us, Signor Fabian.	modern
Dear Mr. Fabian, do me another favor first.	modern
I could be sad if I wanted to be.	modern
Get that fool out of here.	modern
Madam, you’ve treated me badly, very badly.	modern
Dark as hell, Sir Topas.	modern
And I wouldn’t ask for any dowry except for her to play another trick like this one.	modern
If I could make that resemble something in me—Softly!	shakespearean
I’m sorry, Malvolio, but this isn’t my writing, though I admit it looks like mine.	modern
Anything that’s mended is only patched up.	modern
By my birth I rank above you, but don’t be afraid of my greatness.	modern
You are idle, shallow things.	shakespearean
Here comes the count.	shakespearean
I’ll call Sir Toby the whilst.	shakespearean
If this letter doesn’t make him fight, I don’t know what will.	modern
Are you full of them?	shakespearean
No woman is strong enough to put up with the kind of intense passion I feel.	modern
Oh, my poor brother!	modern
I can’t remember anything I’ve ever done to offend anyone.	modern
Maria, take care of this poor fellow here.	modern
Yes, but now there’s no way to calm him down.	modern
I protest I take these wise men that crow so at these set kind of fools no better than the fools' zanies.	shakespearean
By your patience, no.	shakespearean
Then you are mad indeed, if you be no better in your wits than a fool.	shakespearean
I’m not such an idiot that I can’t keep my hands dry.	modern
Why, then, build me thy fortunes upon the basis of valor.	shakespearean
What should I think on ’t?	shakespearean
Art thou a churchman?	shakespearean
Why, he has an income of three thousand ducats a year.	modern
By my troth, the fool has an excellent breast.	shakespearean
As for Monsieur Malvolio, let me take care of him.	modern
I was the only one who refused to give back what I stole.	modern
He’ll release him.	modern
How old is he?	modern
My matter hath no voice, lady, but to your own most pregnant and vouchsafed ear.	shakespearean
Let’s go!	modern
Must she not then be answered?	shakespearean
What is your parentage?” “Above my fortunes, yet my state is well.	shakespearean
You seem to be a good person, captain, and although people who look beautiful are often corrupt inside, I believe that you have a beautiful mind to go with your good looks and manners.	modern
Sweet Sir Toby, be patient for tonight.	shakespearean
If Sir Toby would leave drinking, thou wert as witty a piece of Eve’s flesh as any in Illyria.	shakespearean
Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate with my face?	shakespearean
I have heard of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on others, to taste their valor.	shakespearean
Signed, she who would be your servant,     The Fortunate Unhappy.” This is as clear as sunlight in an open field.	modern
How tragic!	modern
I can’t figure it out by myself!	modern
And wished to see thee cross-gartered.” Cross-gartered?	shakespearean
What kind of man is he?	modern
Or do you but counterfeit?	shakespearean
You are resolute, then?	shakespearean
Hold, sir, here’s my purse.	shakespearean
I will return again into the house and desire some conduct of the lady.	shakespearean
Tis not so sweet now as it was before.	shakespearean
I was telling you to go after her, woo her, confront her.	modern
And your horse now would make him an ass.	shakespearean
I hope to God he keeps his promise!	modern
That’s what she was expecting, and you let her down.	modern
You can’t get any more money out of me right now.	modern
Have some of my servants take care of Malvolio.	modern
Od’s lifelings, here he is!—You broke my head for nothing, and that that I did, I was set on to do ’t by Sir Toby.	shakespearean
Go away.	modern
Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon 'em.	shakespearean
Most wonderful!	shakespearean
How is ’t with you?	shakespearean
Blab my nonsense?	modern
I can hardly keep myself from throwing things at him.	modern
Ask him in here.	modern
If you let her go this easily, Sir Andrew, you don’t deserve to ever use your sword again.	modern
My lord loves you.	modern
I’ll confine myself no finer than I am.	shakespearean
Go on.	modern
I’ll make one too.	shakespearean
Not too fast!	shakespearean
Darn it, if I’d guessed he was so brave and such a good swordsman, I never would have challenged him.	modern
I don’t know what else it could be.	modern
Why, this is evident to any formal capacity.	shakespearean
What news from her?	shakespearean
Hob, nob, is his word.	shakespearean
Take me.	modern
That the soul of our grandam might haply inhabit a bird.	shakespearean
Do not deny.	shakespearean
Take away the lady.	shakespearean
Watch his reaction.	modern
Let thy blood and spirit embrace them.	shakespearean
He’s somewhere else in the house.	modern
The house will be so much quieter.	modern
I breathed from my soul the most faithful offerings to your ungrateful altars that any devoted person has ever offered—what more am I supposed to do?	modern
You must be mistaking me for someone else, sir.	modern
I’d give half my dowry to keep anything bad from happening to him.	modern
He’ll think these letters are from Olivia and that she’s in love with him.	modern
He shall think, by the letters that thou wilt drop, that they come from my niece, and that she’s in love with him.	shakespearean
You are well fleshed.	shakespearean
I think his soul’s in hell, my lady.	modern
Hold little faith, though thou hast too much fear.	shakespearean
Please answer, my good little student.	modern
Show him in.	modern
Come to my room later on.	modern
Wind and rain can’t wash it off.	modern
Maria, our lady wants you.	modern
It’s too bad their beauty fades right when it reaches perfection!	modern
There was no story, my lord.	modern
There is no woman’s sides Can bide the beating of so strong a passion As love doth give my heart.	shakespearean
It’s true, he died on the day my sister turned thirteen.	modern
Yes, and he’ll keep getting funnier till he dies.	modern
O good Sir Toby, hold!	shakespearean
Dexterously, good madonna.	shakespearean
Shall I vent to her that thou art coming?	shakespearean
For this night, to bed, and dream on the event.	shakespearean
Madman, thou errest.	shakespearean
My lady Olivia’s inside, sir.	modern
I cannot love him.	shakespearean
I think oxen and wainropes cannot hale them together.	shakespearean
I am not such an ass, but I can keep my hand dry.	shakespearean
Fate, do your work.	modern
Hello to you.	modern
He left behind myself and my twin sister, who was born in the same hour as me.	modern
Methinks his words do from such passion fly, That he believes himself.	shakespearean
Do you want to go see him?	modern
An you part so, mistress, I would I might never draw sword again.	shakespearean
Yes, that’s the idea.	modern
He finished indeed his mortal act That day that made my sister thirteen years.	shakespearean
Anyone who says you’re a man must not notice how young you are.	modern
Please, my lady, just confirm that you’re the lady of the house so I can get on with my speech.	modern
When did I see thee so put down?	shakespearean
What is his name?	shakespearean
About your years, my lord.	shakespearean
Thou'rt i' the right.	shakespearean
Give me some music.	shakespearean
That’s a degree to love.	shakespearean
But now we don’t have to!	modern
Of what personage and years is he?	shakespearean
Please—and I’ll pay you plenty for this—help me conceal my identity, and find me the right disguise so I can look the way I want.	modern
Oh, I have read it.	shakespearean
But I’m still fairly high-ranking.	modern
All I know is that staying up late is staying up late.	modern
Oh, ho!	shakespearean
Yet you began rudely.	shakespearean
So thou mayst say the king lies by a beggar if a beggar dwell near him, or the church stands by thy tabor, if thy tabor stand by the church.	shakespearean
Good madam, let me see your face.	shakespearean
I’m telling you, this house is dark.	modern
Nice and short and full of good sense—or should I say nonsense?	modern
Madam, you have done me wrong, Notorious wrong.	shakespearean
A most extracting frenzy of mine own From my remembrance clearly banished his.	shakespearean
I leave my duty a little unthought of and speak out of my injury.	shakespearean
If God had been willing, I wish we had died in the same hour too!	modern
What are you going to do?	modern
What do you want to say, sir?	modern
But out of question, ’tis Maria’s hand.	shakespearean
You’ve never seen anything like it.	modern
So this letter, which is so incredibly stupid and ignorant, isn’t going to scare him at all.	modern
Ay, Biddy, come with me.—What, man!	shakespearean
If you leave like this, my dear, I won’t ever use my sword again.	modern
He, upon some action, Is now in durance at Malvolio’s suit, A gentleman and follower of my lady’s.	shakespearean
He sees thee not.	shakespearean
But what’s your jest?	shakespearean
We’ll meet at the Elephant.	modern
No man must know.” What if this someone were you, Malvolio?	modern
Approach, Sir Andrew.	shakespearean
I order you to stop!	modern
Go off.	shakespearean
I’m coming in peace.	modern
You too, Fabian.	modern
To get used to the life you’ll most likely be leading soon, get rid of your low-class trappings.	modern
I will do everything that thou wilt have me.	shakespearean
Are you a comedian?	shakespearean
And what am I supposed to do in Illyria?	modern
That governs the torso and heart, doesn’t it?	modern
What’s going on, Malvolio?	modern
I swear to you, I don’t want to be doing this.	modern
I frown the while, and perchance wind up watch, or play with my—some rich jewel.	shakespearean
I would therefore my sister had no name, sir.	shakespearean
A lady, sir, though it was said she much resembled me, was yet of many accounted beautiful.	shakespearean
Infirmity, that decays the wise, doth ever make the better fool.	shakespearean
I will plant you two, and let the fool make a third, where he shall find the letter.	shakespearean
I’ll follow this good man, and go with you; And, having sworn truth, ever will be true.	shakespearean
I have been dear to him, lad, some two thousand strong, or so.	shakespearean
Have I, Malvolio?	shakespearean
I’m not interested in being good.	modern
Above my fortunes, yet my state is well.	shakespearean
Yes, dear little chick, come along with me.—Shut up, man!	modern
An we do not, it is pity of our lives.	shakespearean
Still so constant, lord.	shakespearean
I hate an ungrateful man more than I hate lying, vanity, babbling, drunkenness, or any other vice that we feeble human beings are susceptible to.— Oh, my God!	modern
Your fate awaits you.	modern
Will you walk towards him?	shakespearean
But, as you say, sir, let your bounty take a nap, I will awake it anon.	shakespearean
Then let thy love be younger than thyself, Or thy affection cannot hold the bent.	shakespearean
Thank you.	modern
I hope you go senile soon, sir, so you can become a more foolish fool!	modern
I’m in so much trouble with my niece that it wouldn’t be safe to let this prank go to its conclusion.	modern
Come, we’ll have him in a dark room and bound.	shakespearean
Well, because I saw your niece Olivia treat the count’s messenger better than she’s ever treated me.	modern
I like you very much.	modern
Wherefore have these gifts a curtain before 'em?	shakespearean
Farewell, fair cruelty.	shakespearean
I think nobly of the soul, and no way approve his opinion.	shakespearean
As hell, Sir Topas.	shakespearean
No, sir, it is legs and thighs.	shakespearean
Now Jove, in his next commodity of hair, send thee a beard!	shakespearean
On thy life I charge thee, hold!	shakespearean
I know I will too, if it’s the last thing I do.	modern
Stay in the dark.	modern
I know he’s noble, rich, young, and with a fine reputation.	modern
Well-a-day that you were, sir.	shakespearean
It’s my master who’s not getting the reward he deserves, not me.	modern
I don’t believe it.	modern
I accept that offer happily, madam.	modern
Open it and read it.	modern
All right, I’ll stay another month.	modern
Oh, it sounded like a sweet breeze blowing gently over a bank of violets, taking their scent with it.	modern
My lord, I swear to you— Oh, don’t swear!	modern
That’s why I wish my sister didn’t have a name, sir.	modern
How old is she?	modern
This was a great argument of love in her toward you.	shakespearean
In faith, they are as true of heart as we.	shakespearean
My niece Olivia will notice, and let me tell you, no matchmaker in the world can get you a woman faster than a reputation for courage.	modern
The fiend is rough and will not be roughly used.	shakespearean
And now I do bethink me, it was she First told me thou wast mad, then camest in smiling, And in such forms which here were presupposed Upon thee in the letter.	shakespearean
One face, one voice, one way of dressing, but two people!	modern
Sometimes I think I’m no smarter than average.	modern
My prayers, minx?	shakespearean
What’s wrong with my niece?	modern
Belong you to the Lady Olivia, friends?	shakespearean
It shall advantage thee more than ever the bearing of letter did.	shakespearean
I prithee—and I’ll pay thee bounteously— Conceal me what I am, and be my aid For such disguise as haply shall become The form of my intent.	shakespearean
But if I shake it up a little it’ll work, because every one of those letters is in my name.	modern
Tis a fair young man, and well attended.	shakespearean
Come, begin.	shakespearean
He claimed to know that already too, and said that’s the reason he’s come to speak with you.	modern
I am a gentleman.	shakespearean
How with mine honor may I give him that Which I have given to you?	shakespearean
I beseech you, do me this courteous office, as to know of the knight what my offense to him is.	shakespearean
Anyone who refuses to drink to my niece until his brain spins around like a merry-go-round is scum.	modern
The better for thy friends.	shakespearean
How do you, Malvolio?	shakespearean
As the sonnet says, “If you please one special person, you please everyone who matters.” Why, what’s going on?	modern
Away before me to sweet beds of flowers.	shakespearean
Tell her my love, more noble than the world, Prizes not quantity of dirty lands; The parts that fortune hath bestowed upon her, Tell her, I hold as giddily as fortune; But ’tis that miracle and queen of gems That nature pranks her in attracts my soul.	shakespearean
My determinate voyage is mere extravagancy.	shakespearean
Do your job.	modern
Who’s that at the gate, uncle?	modern
Let me enjoy my privacy.	modern
I’ll try to calm him down for you if I can.	modern
Set him free.	modern
Come, bring us, bring us where he is.	shakespearean
If she do, he’ll smile and take ’t for a great favor.	shakespearean
And wanted to see you with laces crisscrossed over your legs.” Crisscrossed?	modern
You’d better think up a way to defend yourself.	modern
Who governs here?	shakespearean
This concurs directly with the letter.	shakespearean
Will it be ever thus?	shakespearean
It hath no tongue to vex you.	shakespearean
You stand amazed, But be of comfort.	shakespearean
My dear madam, why are you in mourning?	modern
And yet complainest thou of obstruction?	shakespearean
Receive it so.	shakespearean
I’ve got her now, but I’ve got God to thank for it!	modern
You’re right.	modern
I was born and raised less than three hours from here.	modern
For the love of God, your help!	shakespearean
I beseech you, what manner of man is he?	shakespearean
Hath it not, boy?	shakespearean
Not to be abed after midnight is to be up betimes, and  Nay, my troth, I know not.	shakespearean
My friend Antonio, all I can say is thank you.	modern
At least tell me where you’re going.	modern
Calm down, calm down.	modern
I like singing.	modern
Pardon me, sweet one, even for the vows We made each other but so late ago.	shakespearean
What are you thinking?	modern
One would think his mother’s milk were scarce out of him.	shakespearean
By the Lord, madam, you wrong me, and the world shall know it.	shakespearean
Has anyone seen Cesario?	modern
What can possibly fix this situation?	modern
He seems to have a foreknowledge of that too, and therefore comes to speak with you.	shakespearean
Whither, my lord?—Cesario, husband, stay.	shakespearean
Sad, my lady!	modern
For God’s sake, Sir Toby, you’ve got to come home earlier at night.	modern
She’s a lot like you.	modern
It was a total fluke that you yourself were saved.	modern
Yes, being kept together and put to use.	shakespearean
Take me to the garden.	modern
You can be a eunuch, but I’ll be mute.	modern
How are you, Sir Toby Belch?	modern
And when he strikes back at you, he’ll hit you as sure as you’re standing there.	modern
And you too, sir.	shakespearean
Here comes the Countess.	shakespearean
Make no compare Between that love a woman can bear me And that I owe Olivia.	shakespearean
So go out there and give him what he wants.	modern
He must’ve heard that phrase describing some great man and now he’s using it on a jester.	modern
Weren’t we both born under Taurus?	modern
I tell you, I’m as sane as any man in Illyria.	modern
And so had mine.	shakespearean
If one should be a prey, how much the better To fall before the lion than the wolf!	shakespearean
Easily, madam.	modern
You’re a smart guy.	modern
So we should eat and drink.	modern
He died on Viola’s thirteenth birthday.	modern
Come hither, knight.	shakespearean
I saved his life and gave him my love, without reservation.	modern
It hangs like flax on a distaff.	shakespearean
I’ll sue him for assault and battery, if there’s any justice in Illyria.	modern
I’m a gentleman.	modern
What means this lady?	shakespearean
What will become of this?	shakespearean
He’s a coward and a coistrel that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn o' th' toe like a parish top.	shakespearean
For Monsieur Malvolio, let me alone with him.	shakespearean
Fear’st thou that, Antonio?	shakespearean
Marian, I say!	shakespearean
Were not you even now with the Countess Olivia?	shakespearean
One, sir, that for his love dares yet do more Than you have heard him brag to you he will.	shakespearean
Even what it please my lord that shall become him.	shakespearean
Go to, you’re a dry fool.	shakespearean
Madam, I’ve come here to try to make you like him.	modern
For but a month ago I went from hence, And then ’twas fresh in murmur—as, you know, What great ones do the less will prattle of— That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.	shakespearean
Go look after him.	shakespearean
Why appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady?	shakespearean
Shall we go see the relics of this town?	shakespearean
Come on, to ’t.	shakespearean
Ay, but he will not now be pacified.	shakespearean
em all three all ready.	shakespearean
Who’s talking to him now?	modern
No man must know.” What comes after that?	modern
I shall be constrained in ’t to call thee knave, knight.	shakespearean
Antonio never yet was thief or pirate, Though, I confess, on base and ground enough, Orsino’s enemy.	shakespearean
You must needs yield your reason, Sir Andrew.	shakespearean
As sane as me?	modern
For the love o' God, peace!	shakespearean
Sneck up!	shakespearean
Don’t you have any respect for anything?	modern
O, my poor brother!	shakespearean
Even so quickly may one catch the plague?	shakespearean
Won’t we, Sir Andrew?	modern
Nay, let me alone for swearing.	shakespearean
Past question, for thou seest it will not curl by nature.	shakespearean
Here, wear this jewel for me.	shakespearean
I’ll go another way to work with him.	shakespearean
Keep a little bit of honesty, even if you’re afraid.	modern
Don’t say that—unless you want to be one of my friends.	modern
An thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou mightst never draw sword again.	shakespearean
The knave counterfeits well.	shakespearean
My lady will hang thee for thy absence.	shakespearean
But I don’t get it—what’s the joke?	modern
Most villanously, like a pedant that keeps a school i' the church.	shakespearean
Signed,    The poorly treated Malvolio.” Did he write this?	modern
No man must know.” What follows?	shakespearean
As plain as I see you now.	shakespearean
I remember.	modern
Now, as thou lovest me, let me see his letter.	shakespearean
What dost thou mean?	shakespearean
Very sweet and contagious, i' faith.	shakespearean
I prithee, vent thy folly somewhere else.	shakespearean
He was a bachelor then.	shakespearean
The man grows mad.	shakespearean
What a wonderful time to be alive!	modern
To one of your receiving Enough is shown.	shakespearean
About as old as you are, my lord.	modern
He is as horribly conceited of him, and pants and looks pale, as if a bear were at his heels.	shakespearean
This precious little guy is putty in your hands, Sir Toby.	modern
Why do you say that?	modern
One face, one voice, one habit, and two persons!	shakespearean
Let me see the caper.	shakespearean
If you want things done in the right way, you’ll have to let me read a crazy letter in a crazy voice.	modern
Unless the master were the man.	shakespearean
Isn’t he getting funnier?	modern
If you tell your lady I’m here to speak with her, and bring her out with you when you come back, you might make me more generous.	modern
I did think, by the excellent constitution of thy leg, it was formed under the star of a galliard.	shakespearean
What is he at the gate, cousin?	shakespearean
Maybe you’ll see some little trinket you want to buy.	modern
How vexest thou this man!	shakespearean
I am no fee’d post, lady.	shakespearean
I bring no overture of war, no taxation of homage.	shakespearean
My lady is within, sir.	shakespearean
Open ’t, and read it.	shakespearean
Come, sir, I pray you, go.	shakespearean
Haply your eye shall light upon some toy You have desire to purchase, and your store, I think, is not for idle markets, sir.	shakespearean
Ass, I doubt not.	shakespearean
What do you think of this fool, Malvolio?	modern
Alas, I took great pains to study it, and ’tis poetical.	shakespearean
The fact that he serves as a go-between for his lord and my niece Olivia confirms this.	modern
Go call him hither.	shakespearean
I’ll ride home tomorrow, Sir Toby.	shakespearean
But if she cannot love you, sir?	shakespearean
I will construe to them whence you come.	shakespearean
But my hair looks good anyway, doesn’t it?	modern
Come on, let’s put him in a dark room and tie him up.	modern
Make the trial of it in any constant question.	shakespearean
Is ’t so saucy?	shakespearean
Hurt him in eleven different places.	modern
An I do not— Come, let’s see the event.	shakespearean
Nothing that is so is so.	shakespearean
Oh ho!	modern
Hold, sir, or I’ll throw your dagger o'er the house.	shakespearean
Here comes my little bird.	modern
I am no fighter.	shakespearean
We human beings don’t control our own destinies.	modern
This man is probably like that.	modern
No, sir, worse off.	modern
You’re awfully eager to fight.	modern
He cannot by the duello avoid it.	shakespearean
There’s something going on that’s not what it seems.	modern
Dear lady— Give me leave, beseech you.	shakespearean
And the doctors say it’s healthy to get up early— I don’t know what the doctors say.	modern
Where do you come from, sir?	modern
Do ’t, knight.	shakespearean
This is as uncivil as strange.	shakespearean
He shall enlarge him.	shakespearean
He started one poor heart of mine in thee.	shakespearean
In fact, I’d do even more to him than what you’ve heard him promise to do.	modern
I forgive you the praise.	shakespearean
I speak too loud.— Where’s Malvolio?	shakespearean
That’s too bad, because I spent a long time memorizing it, and it’s poetic.	modern
Sir, the person who should sing that song isn’t here.	modern
What’s she trying to say?	modern
Give me.	shakespearean
Still so cruel?	shakespearean
Oh, it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound, That breathes upon a bank of violets, Stealing and giving odor.	shakespearean
Go to, thou art made, if thou desirest to be so—” Am I made?	shakespearean
What’s a drunken man like, fool?	shakespearean
My dear fool, because my brother died.	modern
You’ve made up your mind, then?	modern
Go and wiggle your ears!	modern
May I kiss your feet?	modern
Dost thou live by thy tabour?	shakespearean
Do not then walk too open.	shakespearean
Why are you talking like this?	modern
Then I’ll pay you for doing what you like.	modern
Oh, you’re a clergyman?	modern
Please, fool, go away.	modern
So full of shapes is fancy That it alone is high fantastical.	shakespearean
She’s a fine woman, all right.	modern
In the wars.	shakespearean
I defy brain-death!	modern
He does smile his face into more lines than is in the new map with the augmentation of the Indies.	shakespearean
But you’re still complaining of darkness and a bad view?	modern
He smiles so much his face has more lines in it than a map of the East Indies.	modern
How now, Malvolio!	shakespearean
Here comes the Duke now.	modern
His employment between his lord and my niece confirms no less.	shakespearean
It’s easier to buy young people than to beg or borrow them.	modern
O time, thou must untangle this, not I.	shakespearean
I tell thee true.	shakespearean
Wilt thou set thy foot o' my neck?	shakespearean
These clothes are good enough to drink in, and so be these boots too.	shakespearean
He shall see none to fear.	shakespearean
Why, what would you?	shakespearean
Please, do me this one favor: find out what I’ve done to offend this knight.	modern
If you can’t, and would prefer to leave, she’s very willing to say goodbye to you.	modern
The more fool, madonna, to mourn for your brother’s soul being in heaven.	shakespearean
Would you rather hear a love song or a song about the good life?	modern
Speak to me.	shakespearean
But it becomes me well enough, does ’t not?	shakespearean
I saw him put down the other day with an ordinary fool that	shakespearean
But you’re not going to deliver it, are you?	modern
Sayest thou that house is dark?	shakespearean
Shouldn’t she just accept that?	modern
Why do you hide these things?	modern
Don’t refuse it.	modern
I wish it might, for now I am your fool.	shakespearean
If you can shape up, you’re welcome to stay in the house.	modern
What is to be said to him, lady?	shakespearean
I would be sorry, sir, but the fool should be as oft with your master as with my mistress: I think I saw your wisdom there.	shakespearean
They say he has been fencer to the Sophy.	shakespearean
If you’re just insane, then get out of here.	modern
I am all the daughters of my father’s house, And all the brothers too—and yet I know not.	shakespearean
Let me yet know of you whither you are bound.	shakespearean
My lord, I do protest—    O, do not swear!	shakespearean
If you will let your lady know I am here to speak with her, and bring her along with you, it may awake my bounty further.	shakespearean
Gracious Olivia— What do you say, Cesario?—Good my lord— My lord would speak.	shakespearean
Go, hang yourselves all!	shakespearean
I’ll help you, Sir Toby.	modern
Tell me what it’s about.	modern
Hold, there’s expenses for thee.	shakespearean
He’s written you a letter.	modern
I’ll come to him.	shakespearean
We’ve got some words of wisdom to mull over.	modern
Let’s go.	modern
Why, thou hast put him in such a dream that when the image of it leaves him he must run mad.	shakespearean
Cast thy humble slough,” says she.	shakespearean
Fear not, Cesario.	shakespearean
My boy, it’s true.	modern
Fate, show thy force.	shakespearean
You have to come with me.	modern
Someone adored me once, too.	modern
I’ll not meddle with him.	shakespearean
Thank God and my horoscope!	modern
I hate your logic as much as I hate an empty drinking cup.	modern
With the same 'havior that your passion bears Goes on my master’s grief.	shakespearean
Yes, my lord.	modern
Thou mightst have done this without thy beard and gown.	shakespearean
I know my medicine will work on him.	modern
That you do think you are not what you are.	shakespearean
Believe me, I’m not.	modern
Good madonna, give me leave to prove you a fool.	shakespearean
I feel sorry for you.	modern
And, to inure thyself to what thou art like to be, cast thy humble slough and appear fresh.	shakespearean
For the love of God, help us!	modern
There’s no darkness except ignorance, and you’re more ignorant than the Egyptians during the plague of fog.	modern
Cesario, you do not keep promise with me.	shakespearean
We shall have a rare letter from him: but you’ll not deliver ’t?	shakespearean
What about it?	modern
Never trust me, then.	shakespearean
Be loud and obnoxious.	modern
He’ll speak with you, will you or no.	shakespearean
Gentleman, God save thee.	shakespearean
But what’s he like?	modern
No, he just smiles.	modern
Spend this for me.	shakespearean
What a caterwauling do you keep here!	shakespearean
Souls and bodies hath he divorced three, and his incensement at this moment is so implacable that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death and sepulchre.	shakespearean
I prithee, foolish Greek, depart from me.	shakespearean
You’re smiling?	modern
In voices well divulged, free, learned, and valiant; And in dimension and the shape of nature A gracious person.	shakespearean
God send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for the better increasing your folly!	shakespearean
I swear I am.	modern
Let me enjoy my private.	shakespearean
Good fool, help me to some light and some paper.	shakespearean
I’ll none of it.	shakespearean
As for him, I never think about him.	modern
More matter for a May morning.	shakespearean
He’s furious because you insulted him, and he has a right to satisfaction.	modern
What are you?	shakespearean
Come, away!	shakespearean
Is it so long?— Call forth the holy father.	shakespearean
My life upon ’t, young though thou art, thine eye Hath stay’d upon some favor that it loves.	shakespearean
Has here writ a letter to you.	shakespearean
Well, well.	modern
You can do whatever you want as long as it’s socially appropriate.	modern
My lady has a white hand, and the Myrmidons are no bottle-ale houses.	shakespearean
My niece is already in the belief that he’s mad.	shakespearean
Does she so?	shakespearean
My prayers, you hussy?	modern
No, sir.	modern
I could not find him at the Elephant.	shakespearean
My lady told me to tell you that while she lets you stay at her house because you’re a relative, she doesn’t approve of your behavior.	modern
Well, we all have our special gifts.	modern
I’d rather be a heretic than a schemer with fancy plots.	modern
I go, sir, but I would not have you to think that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness.	shakespearean
How will this fadge?	shakespearean
I’d hate to waste my speech on the wrong person, because It’s very well written and I spent a lot of time and energy memorizing it.	modern
No, sir, the worse.	shakespearean
I can make my handwriting look just like Lady Olivia’s: she	modern
I’m going to forget my duties to you a little bit and complain about the injuries you’ve caused me.	modern
Stay right here and try to look good.	modern
What wilt thou do?	shakespearean
I’m not a fighter.	modern
The first drink makes him a fool, the second makes him crazy, and the third drowns him.	modern
Go back to your lord.	modern
But as a gentleman and a soldier he’s promised me he won’t hurt you.	modern
For God’s sake, shut up!	modern
I did send, After the last enchantment you did here, A ring in chase of you.	shakespearean
Madam, there’s a young gentleman at the gate who really wants to speak to you.	modern
Sir Toby would bet a fortune that I’m not smart, but he wouldn’t bet two cents that you’re not a fool.	modern
When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.	shakespearean
Thy reason, dear venom, give thy reason.	shakespearean
You’re right, sir.	modern
It’s half of all my money.	modern
Is this the kind of world where we hide our accomplishments?	modern
I do assure you, ’tis against my will.	shakespearean
Yes, and shall do till the pangs of death shake him.	shakespearean
What meanest thou by that, Malvolio?	shakespearean
I’d send seven of my servants to go get him.	modern
Mr. Fabian, stay with this gentleman until I come back.	modern
How now, mistress?	shakespearean
Don’t compare a woman’s love for a man with my love for Olivia.	modern
A beautiful voice, I swear.	modern
Are you making all this noise at this time of night because you have no manners, or because you’re just stupid?	modern
The cunning of her passion Invites me in this churlish messenger.	shakespearean
What thinkest thou of his opinion?	shakespearean
I’ve been so tortured since I lost track of you!	modern
And I would die a thousand deaths cheerfully, if it made your life easier.	modern
A gentleman?	shakespearean
No, madam, he does nothing but smile.	shakespearean
If I think so, I think the same of you.	shakespearean
Why, let her except, before excepted.	shakespearean
Have you completely forgotten?	modern
Signior Fabian, stay you by this gentleman till my return.	shakespearean
Was not this love indeed?	shakespearean
Good for you, holding out on me like this!	modern
If this fall into thy hand, revolve.	shakespearean
Anything that’s mended is but patched.	shakespearean
He’s really taken this prank to heart.	modern
But still, she’s going to kill you for being gone so long.	modern
Oh, I’ve read that.	modern
Well, you know, “some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them.” Anyway, I was part of the trick, sir.	modern
And what’s her story?	modern
He has heard that word of some great man and now applies it to a fool.	shakespearean
The honorable lady of the house, which is she?	shakespearean
No man must know.” If this should be thee, Malvolio?	shakespearean
But you have to.	modern
I’d write sad songs about unrequited love and sing them loudly in the middle of the night.	modern
Look, here comes the fool.	modern
I’ll only admit that you’re sane when you agree with Pythagoras and hesitate to kill a bird because it might contain your grandmother’s soul.	modern
No way but gentleness, gently, gently.	shakespearean
O, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted.	shakespearean
And I beseech you come again tomorrow.	shakespearean
And I beg you, please come here again tomorrow.	modern
Your will?	shakespearean
Just read it.	modern
This is a dear manikin to you, Sir Toby.	shakespearean
Vent my folly!	shakespearean
Shall we do that?	shakespearean
Virtue that transgresses is but patched with sin, and sin that amends is but patched with virtue.	shakespearean
Take him away.	modern
Who I am and what I want are a secret.	modern
Scout me for him at the corner the orchard like a bum-baily.	shakespearean
He’s killed three people, and he’s so furious right now that the only thing that will satisfy him is seeing you die.	modern
Welcome, ass.	shakespearean
It hangs like an old worn-out mop.	modern
But I swear I’m not the person I’m playing.	modern
You’ve made him so delusional he’ll go crazy when he learns the truth.	modern
Well held out, i' faith.	shakespearean
Good, very good.	modern
He’s pale and hyperventilating, as if a bear were chasing him.	modern
I’m headed for your niece, sir.	modern
Oh please, go somewhere else to blab your nonsense.	modern
And he doesn’t let go of his target when a distraction appears.	modern
Wait, here’s a coin for you.	modern
He speaks nothing but madman.	shakespearean
And ask no other dowry with her but such another jest.	shakespearean
I like it too.	modern
The captain who brought me to shore has my women’s clothes.	modern
You should have run up to her, unleashed a few excellent quips invented on the spot, and rendered the young man speechless.	modern
If I lose a scruple of this sport, let me be boiled to death with melancholy.	shakespearean
So do not I.	shakespearean
Keep your purse.	shakespearean
I know you’re the right person for this job.	modern
I have heard her swear ’t.	shakespearean
This was looked for at your hand, and this was balked.	shakespearean
Hello to you too, sir.	modern
We respected the beat of the song, sir.	modern
Lady Olivia told her servant Malvolio to kick you out of the house.	modern
Come, Sir Andrew, there’s no remedy.	shakespearean
That’s sides and heart.	shakespearean
Why, would that have mended my hair?	shakespearean
You might do much.	shakespearean
For youth is bought more oft than begged or borrow’d.	shakespearean
Which is Sebastian?	shakespearean
You’d be the funniest person in Illyria… if Sir Toby ever stopped drinking.	modern
The same people who say he gets drunk with you every night.	modern
He really was tricked horribly.	modern
I know you.	modern
What years, i' faith?	shakespearean
But I just can’t love him.	modern
Have you no wit, manners, nor honesty but to gabble like tinkers at this time of night?	shakespearean
So listen up, princess.	modern
O, by your leave, I pray you, I bade you never speak again of him.	shakespearean
No, I don’t know you, and my lady didn’t send me to get you, and I’m not supposed to tell you to come speak with her, and your name is not Master Cesario, and this is not my nose, either.	modern
What would my lord, but that he may not have, Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable?	shakespearean
Do not desire to see this letter.	shakespearean
Keep your money.	modern
Yet there he was, and there I found this credit, That he did range the town to seek me out.	shakespearean
Do but read.	shakespearean
He is knight, dubbed with unhatched rapier and on carpet consideration, but he is a devil in private brawl.	shakespearean
You should’ve saved me some trouble and taken it away yourself.	modern
Though you have put me into darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over me, yet have I the benefit of my senses as well as your Ladyship.	shakespearean
There’s some gentleman out there.— Good Sir Toby!	modern
I know not what ’twas but distraction.	shakespearean
Though the last time I saw him it was black from the smoke of war.	modern
A baubling vessel was he captain of, For shallow draught and bulk unprizable, With which such scathful grapple did he make With the most noble bottom of our fleet, That very envy and the tongue of loss Cried fame and honor on him.—What’s the matter?	shakespearean
Father, could I please ask you to tell these people what happened between me and this young man?	modern
I’m not like you.	modern
Go take care of him.	modern
God bless you, my friend, and your music too.	modern
I’m very sensitive, and even the smallest bit of rudeness hurts my feelings.	modern
Your cousin, my lady, takes great exceptions to your ill hours.	shakespearean
No, indeed, sir; the Lady Olivia has no folly.	shakespearean
Why, man, he’s a very devil.	shakespearean
Here lies your way.	shakespearean
Doesn’t that sound like true love?	modern
How are you, Malvolio?	modern
Make that good.	shakespearean
Excuse me, weren’t you with Countess Olivia just now?	modern
Nay, I’ll come.	shakespearean
Of very ill manner.	shakespearean
Are you really going to pretend you don’t know me now?	modern
He left this ring behind him, Would I or not.	shakespearean
In Orsino’s heart.	modern
I know thy constellation is right apt For this affair.	shakespearean
Hello, sir!	modern
We did keep time, sir, in our catches.	shakespearean
Wherefore, sweetheart?	shakespearean
Fool, fool, hey, fool!	modern
Get you to your lord.	shakespearean
Old age always makes people act funny—even wise people, but fools more than anybody.	modern
Not bad; you might accomplish something.	modern
Oh, I’ll beat him up for that!	modern
Have you not set mine honor at the stake, And baited it with all the unmuzzled thoughts That tyrannous heart can think?	shakespearean
An hour before you pulled me out of the breaking waves, my sister drowned.	modern
My brother he is in Elysium.	shakespearean
Most radiant, exquisite and unmatchable beauty—I pray you, tell me if this be the lady of the house, for I never saw her.	shakespearean
Like aqua vitae with a midwife.	shakespearean
I rescued that ungrateful boy next to you from drowning.	modern
And what should I do in Illyria?	shakespearean
They say he used to fence for the shah of Persia.	modern
A very dishonest paltry boy, and more a coward than a hare.	shakespearean
Let us therefore eat and drink.	shakespearean
Oh, say it, and mean it!	modern
I’d follow you to the gates of Hell, you sneaky little devil!	modern
So let her execute me.	modern
To answer by the method, in the first of his heart.	shakespearean
If only you were, sir.	modern
I have many enemies in Orsino’s court, Else would I very shortly see thee there.	shakespearean
Love is so vivid and fantastical that nothing compares to it.	modern
Haven’t you totally dismissed my honor and integrity in your anger?	modern
So could I.	modern
He’s fortified against any denial.	shakespearean
If you will see it, follow me.	shakespearean
Thy Fates open their hands.	shakespearean
There must be some mistake, sir.	modern
Can he that deny?	shakespearean
Some achieve greatness—” What are you saying?	modern
Beautiful ladies, please don’t treat me badly.	modern
I swear, anyone smart who laughs at these courts jesters is nothing but a jester’s apprentice.	modern
Wow, he’s a real devil.	modern
There’s no ambiguity here.	modern
No, not at all.	modern
Too well what love women to men may owe.	shakespearean
How now!	shakespearean
The world’s gone downhill since fake humility started passing for compliments.	modern
He’s wearing yellow stockings.	modern
He talks nothing but nonsense.	modern
Get rid of your low-class trapping,” she said.	modern
It is too hard a knot for me to untie!	shakespearean
By my troth, sir, no—though it please you to be one of my friends.	shakespearean
She returns this ring to you, sir.	shakespearean
Why, I think so.	shakespearean
He’s a very fool and a prodigal.	shakespearean
How is that possible?	modern
The other day I saw him defeated in a	modern
And you, sir.	shakespearean
I’m listening to you only because I’ve got nothing better to do.	modern
He’s a knight.	modern
You’re asking me!	modern
Get him to say his prayers, good Sir Toby, get him to pray.	shakespearean
Pray you, sir, do you know of this matter?	shakespearean
Write loyal cantons of contemned love And sing them loud even in the dead of night.	shakespearean
Oh, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and taste with a distempered appetite.	shakespearean
The competitors enter.	shakespearean
I’d bet my life that, as young as you are, you’ve fallen in love with someone.	modern
Come to what is important in ’t.	shakespearean
You could just as easily say that a king sleeps near a beggar if the beggar lives near him, or that the church is supported by your drum because it “stands by” your drum.	modern
Come, sir, you peevishly threw it to her, and her will is it should be so returned.	shakespearean
I’ve heard her say that.	modern
The door’s right here.	modern
I left no ring with her.	shakespearean
I will give out divers schedules of my beauty.	shakespearean
My dear Miss Chat-her-up, I look forward to getting to know you better.	modern
It may be worth thy pains, for I can sing And speak to him in many sorts of music That will allow me very worth his service.	shakespearean
I wouldn’t have missed this even for a pension of thousands of pounds, to be paid by the shah of Persia.	modern
You won’t be wasting your time, because I really can sing and talk to him about many different kinds of music, so he’ll be happy to have me in his service.	modern
I may command where I adore, But silence, like a Lucrece knife, With bloodless stroke my heart doth gore; M.O.A.I.	shakespearean
A dry jest, sir.	shakespearean
It shines everywhere.	shakespearean
You shouldn’t talk about him like that!	modern
I hate a drunken rogue.	shakespearean
Where goes Cesario?	shakespearean
I hope she doesn’t have a crush on me!	modern
This is open.	shakespearean
I am not of your element.	shakespearean
They’re good enough to drink in, and so are these boots.	modern
Then don’t make yourself too conspicuous.	modern
You’ll know more about it later.	modern
Absolutely, you idiot.	modern
Did it really work?	modern
Sad, lady!	shakespearean
I will fetch you light, and paper, and ink.	shakespearean
That face of his I do remember well.	shakespearean
I’ll give him my gray horse Capilet if he forgets the whole thing.	modern
Good madonna, why mournest thou?	shakespearean
People say he’s generous, well educated, and brave, and he’s very attractive.	modern
This fellow is wise enough to play the fool, And to do that well craves a kind of wit.	shakespearean
Let her hang me.	shakespearean
She made good view of me, indeed so much That sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue, For she did speak in starts distractedly.	shakespearean
Why dost thou not go to church in a galliard and come home in a coranto?	shakespearean
Stop right now or I’ll throw your dagger over the roof.	modern
Here comes Sir Toby halting.	shakespearean
I’m not a paid messenger, my lady.	modern
The lady of the Strachy married the yeoman of the wardrobe.	shakespearean
Accept it in body and spirit.	modern
No, follow him now, before he divulges the prank and ruins everything.	modern
Only really cruel people can be called deformed.	modern
Call the priest.	modern
I prithee, be gone.	shakespearean
What stunning, exquisite, and unmatchable beauty—but please, tell me if you’re the lady of the house, because I’ve never seen her.	modern
I mean please go into the house, sir.	modern
I know your favor well, Though now you have no sea-cap on your head.— Take him away.	shakespearean
Oh, please be true, please let it be that this man has mistaken me for you, my dear brother!	modern
He’s in yellow stockings.	shakespearean
Methinks sometimes I have no more wit than a Christian or an ordinary man has.	shakespearean
Let me see you dance.	modern
And they have been grand-jurymen since before Noah was a sailor.	shakespearean
Orsino, this is the same Antonio who took the	modern
with the same accessories.	modern
Tis my picture.	shakespearean
Are you insane?	modern
Do you want to go hunting, my lord?	modern
Ay, sir, we are some of her trappings.	shakespearean
Be not afraid of greatness.” 'Twas well writ.	shakespearean
If you insist on trying my patience any further, then take out your sword right now.	modern
What is the matter with thee?	shakespearean
I think you’re denying what you really are.	modern
Please, hurry.	modern
How now, Sir Toby Belch!	shakespearean
She that would alter services with thee,  The Fortunate Unhappy”  Daylight and champaign discovers not more.	shakespearean
She’s the reason I’m here.	modern
After you cast your magic spell on me last time, I sent you a ring.	modern
Speak your office.	shakespearean
Ay, he.	shakespearean
I’ll be vain and proud, I’ll read up on politics, I’ll insult Sir Toby, I’ll get rid of my lower-class friends, and I’ll be the perfect man for her.	modern
If you love me, let me know by smiling at me.	modern
Ay me, detested!	shakespearean
What else could you possibly think of me?	modern
And yet, by the very fangs of malice I swear, I am not that I play.	shakespearean
That’s true.	modern
But I’ll deliver Sir Andrew’s challenge by word of mouth, describing Sir Andrew as courageous in battle and convincing the young gentleman that Sir Andrew is furious, impetuous, and a skilled fighter (he’ll believe me because he’s young).	modern
I will, my lady, but a sane person reading this would make it sound crazy.	modern
It begins “Hold thy peace.” I shall never begin if I hold my peace.	shakespearean
Play me some music.	modern
She’s not good enough for you, then.	modern
My Cesario?	modern
If you want to watch, follow me.	modern
Then he’s no good.	modern
I sent for you about a sad occasion.	modern
Where’s Cesario going?	modern
Fortune forbid my outside have not charmed her!	shakespearean
He is, indeed, sir, the most skillful, bloody, and fatal opposite that you could possibly have found in any part of Illyria.	shakespearean
I do I know not what and fear to find Mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind.	shakespearean
Who you are and what you would are out of my welkin, I might say “element,” but the word is overworn.	shakespearean
Yet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble, Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth.	shakespearean
How now, Malvolio?	shakespearean
When has anyone ever put you down like that.	modern
But, if you were the devil, you are fair.	shakespearean
Do thy office.	shakespearean
Cesario is my name—your servant’s name—fair princess.	modern
Most sweet lady— A comfortable doctrine, and much may be said of it.	shakespearean
Ay, but I know— What dost thou know?	shakespearean
He’s somewhere between boy and man.	modern
Be you his eunuch, and your mute I’ll be.	shakespearean
But oh, how vile an idol proves this god!	shakespearean
So could I too.	shakespearean
Nothing that can be can come between me and the full prospect of my hopes.	shakespearean
That’s a lame answer.	modern
A good note, that keeps you from the blow of the law.	shakespearean
He is sure possessed, madam.	shakespearean
Away with him!	shakespearean
If they aren’t, they can go hang themselves by their own laces!	modern
But, sir, I will deliver his challenge by word of mouth, set upon Aguecheek a notable report of valor, and drive the gentleman (as I know his youth will aptly receive it) into a most hideous opinion of his rage, skill, fury, and impetuosity.	shakespearean
What are you saying, mistress?	modern
Why, anyone can see what this means.	modern
I recognize your face perfectly, even without a sailor’s cap on your head.—Take him away.	modern
Malvolio, your vanity is damaging your good taste.	modern
I’ll tell them where you come from, though I don’t know who you are or what you want.	modern
Should we do that?	modern
How have you made division of yourself?	shakespearean
But, come what may, I do adore thee so That danger shall seem sport, and I will go.	shakespearean
I’ll go on with my speech praising you, and then I’ll get to the point.	modern
Belike this is a man of that quirk.	shakespearean
Why do you keep these talents behind a curtain?	modern
Fare thee well.	shakespearean
Why don’t you go off to church dancing one way, and come home dancing another way?	modern
Well, I will be so much a sinner, to be a double-dealer.	shakespearean
What’s the matter with you?	modern
Thou shalt hold the opinion of Pythagoras ere I will allow of thy wits, and fear to kill a woodcock lest thou dispossess the soul of thy grandam.	shakespearean
No, I won’t stay a second longer.	modern
Honestly, sir, I’d need to use words to explain why, and since words are so unreliable and false, I’d rather avoid using them in a serious discussion.	modern
True, madam.	shakespearean
Are you always so funny?	modern
Oh, ’twill be admirable!	shakespearean
Here comes the fool, i' faith.	shakespearean
Do you think you’ve got a couple of fools on your hands here?	modern
What shall you ask of me that I’ll deny, That honor, saved, may upon asking give?	shakespearean
How do you know?	modern
Alas, sir, be patient.	shakespearean
Let him be the devil if he wants to, I don’t care.	modern
Father, I charge thee, by thy reverence, Here to unfold (though lately we intended To keep in darkness what occasion now Reveals before ’tis ripe) what thou dost know Hath newly passed between this youth and me.	shakespearean
Wilt thou go to bed, Malvolio?	shakespearean
She took that ring from me.	modern
Too old by heaven.	shakespearean
I can write very like my lady your niece: on a forgotten matter we can hardly make distinction of our hands.	shakespearean
Go away.	modern
It doesn’t need to be witty as long as it’s eloquent and imaginative.	modern
In my stars I am above thee, but be not afraid of greatness.	shakespearean
Thou shall present me as an eunuch to him.	shakespearean
It’s going to be fun, I promise.	modern
That’s out of tune, sir.	modern
But if he had not been in drink, he would have tickled you othergates than he did.	shakespearean
Fabian can hardly control him over there.	modern
And for his cowardship, ask Fabian.	shakespearean
If all the devils of hell be drawn in little, and Legion himself possessed him, yet I’ll speak to him.	shakespearean
I didn’t find him at the Elephant.	modern
What do you say to that, Malvolio?	modern
It’s much better to be destroyed by a noble enemy than by a cruel and heartless one.	modern
When I first heard about him, he was still a bachelor.	modern
With crisscrossed laces?	modern
Be curst and brief.	shakespearean
Well, he’ll be dead, so he won’t see anything.	modern
Antonio, I arrest thee at the suit of Count Orsino.	shakespearean
The count himself here hard by woos her.	shakespearean
I know that my lady’s going to end up hitting him.	modern
My lady would never want to lose him.	modern
Thanks for telling me.	modern
Do you make your living by playing that drum?	modern
Does he rave?	shakespearean
Yes, husband.	modern
But I’ll admit I don’t care for you.	modern
I’ll hold on to your money and leave you for an hour.	modern
You’re all lazy and shallow.	modern
What was the philosopher Pythagoras’s belief about wild birds?	modern
And died that day when Viola from her birth Had numbered thirteen years.	shakespearean
I would we were well rid of this knavery.	shakespearean
I don’t care what you think of me.	modern
Please don’t say no.	modern
But if it’s not double-dealing, sir, I wish you’d deal me another.	modern
It starts, “Shut up.” I’ll never be able to start if I shut up.	modern
Please go inside.	modern
Sir Toby, madam, your kinsman.	shakespearean
Nay, come, I prithee.	shakespearean
I am very comptible, even to the least sinister usage.	shakespearean
Here’s a postscript!.	modern
But you’re a famous pirate!	modern
A wreck past hope he was.	shakespearean
Now that I think about it, Maria was the one who first told me you were insane.	modern
If he cannot, let the tailor mend him.	modern
Come with me, please.	modern
Good fool, as ever thou wilt deserve well at my hand, help me to a candle, and pen, ink, and paper.	shakespearean
What a pretty picture, three fools all together.	modern
I have heard my father name him.	shakespearean
His counsel now might do me golden service.	shakespearean
I am still so faithful, my lord.	modern
Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp yourself, for what is yours to bestow is not yours to reserve.	shakespearean
If this letter move him not, his legs cannot.	shakespearean
I’ll let you get away with skipping the praise.	modern
An angel is walking on earth.	modern
Thou'rt a scholar.	shakespearean
So that by my foes, sir I profit in the knowledge of myself, and by my friends, I am abused.	shakespearean
I’ll be your purse-bearer and leave you For an hour.	shakespearean
Give me faith, say I.	shakespearean
Be clamorous, and leap all civil bounds, Rather than make unprofited return.	shakespearean
Give them way till he take leave, and presently after him.	shakespearean
What, Curio?	shakespearean
You could’ve done this without your beard and gown.	modern
Never in your life, I think, unless you see canary put me down.	shakespearean
The brilliant Sir Topas!	modern
Honestly, I can’t.	modern
Your hand is  Well, I hope so.	modern
Yes, it is, I think.	modern
But come on, start.	modern
God bless you, Mr.	modern
My father had a daughter loved a man As it might be, perhaps, were I a woman, I should your lordship.	shakespearean
Challenge the count’s young servant to a fight.	modern
I mean, she is the list of my voyage.	shakespearean
I’ll go back inside and ask the lady for some kind of escort.	modern
I had a round with him, and his sword thrust is so deadly that you can’t even duck out of the way.	modern
FOOL Oh, he’s drunk, Sir Toby, an hour agone.	shakespearean
I thank you for your pains.	shakespearean
You still haven’t said anything incriminating.	modern
What do you want?	modern
Where, good Miss Mary?	modern
It’s definitely Maria’s handwriting.	modern
He was the captain of a flimsy boat that was practically worthless because it was so small.	modern
As for his thoughts, I wish he’d think about nothing at all rather than think about me all the time.	modern
I hate no-good drunks.	modern
This is the air, that is the glorious sun.	shakespearean
Therefore in my presence still smile, dear my sweet, I prithee.”	shakespearean
From the Count Orsino, is it?	shakespearean
Chat her up, Sir Andrew.	modern
Your lord knows what I think.	modern
Good night, Penthesilea.	shakespearean
I’ve sent for him.	modern
Most sweet lady— Oh, “sweet”!	modern
And when she does, he’ll imagine she’s flirting with him.	modern
Still you keep o' the windy side of the law.	shakespearean
Well, I’ll commit the sin of double-dealing, and deal you a second coin.	modern
O knight, thou lackest a cup of canary.	shakespearean
Pray God, he keep his oath!	shakespearean
For they shall yet belie thy happy years That say thou art a man.	shakespearean
I’ll have an action of battery against him if there be any law in Illyria.	shakespearean
The count’s messenger, Cesario.	modern
Oh, go away, you’re a boring fool.	modern
Is there no respect of place, persons, nor time in you?	shakespearean
An apple, cleft in two, is not more twin Than these two creatures.	shakespearean
Madam, I come to whet your gentle thoughts On his behalf.	shakespearean
Shall we rouse the night owl in a catch that will draw three souls out of one weaver?	shakespearean
I wouldn’t even pee without dancing a waltz.	modern
I’ll help you.	modern
Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.	shakespearean
I must catechise you for it, madonna.	shakespearean
The madly used Malvolio.”  Did he write this?	shakespearean
He insists he’ll speak with you whether you want him to or not.	modern
Give it to me.	modern
Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them.	modern
It alone concerns your ear.	shakespearean
A little bit.	modern
Not yet old enough for a man, nor young enough for a boy, as a squash is before ’tis a peascod, or a codling when ’tis almost an apple.	shakespearean
Look, sir, this is a portrait of me as I am at this particular moment.	modern
Plague on ’t, an I thought he had been valiant and so cunning in fence, I’d have seen him damned ere I’d have challenged him.	shakespearean
How unbelievable!	modern
So shut up!	modern
Fie, that you’ll say so!	shakespearean
I will prove it legitimate, sir, upon the oaths of judgment and reason.	shakespearean
I know my lady will strike him.	shakespearean
Here comes the messenger with your niece.	modern
I’ll have to ask you some questions, madam.	modern
Besides, you’ve gotten unreliable.	modern
Sir, shall I to this lady?	shakespearean
Anything I did to you, I did it because Sir Toby made me.	modern
Oh, I know.	modern
Not old enough to be a man, but not young enough to be a boy.	modern
Sir, I have not you by the hand.	shakespearean
Oh, that record is lively in my soul!	shakespearean
Would thou’dst be ruled by me!	shakespearean
Fare you well at once.	shakespearean
Why, this is excellent.	shakespearean
Believe me, I am not.	shakespearean
Well, go along now.	modern
There’s one at the gate.	shakespearean
I’ll no more of you.	shakespearean
Look then to be well edified when the fool delivers the madman.	shakespearean
I was so crazy myself that I forgot all about him.	modern
Then lead the way, good father; and heavens so shine That they may fairly note this act of mine.	shakespearean
Cesario, go visit that cruel Olivia one more time.	modern
How now, my metal of India?	shakespearean
Now go!	modern
He is about the house.	shakespearean
I am afraid this great lubber, the world, will prove a cockney.	shakespearean
Marry, I saw your niece do more favors to the Count’s servingman than ever she bestowed upon me.	shakespearean
How dost thou, my good fellow?	shakespearean
I’ll never believe a madman until I can see his brains.	modern
Do that.	modern
Look how shapely your legs are.	modern
Hold, Toby!	shakespearean
If this were played upon a stage now, I could condemn it as an improbable fiction.	shakespearean
Sebastian are you?	shakespearean
Go hang yourselves, all of you!	modern
In his bosom?	shakespearean
If this young gentleman has offended you, I’ll take the blame for it.	modern
If not, what can you do about it?	modern
That’s a good thing to put in—it keeps you from getting in trouble with the law.	modern
Here is yet a postscript.	shakespearean
At your service, madam.	modern
He is now in some commerce with my lady and will by and by depart.	shakespearean
I won’t take it back.	modern
Hello, my friends!	modern
You can speak to me.	modern
If you’re my friend, you’ll let me see his letter.	modern
Dear Sir Toby, don’t do anything rash tonight.	modern
Here comes the man who rescued me, sir.	modern
Shall I play my freedom at tray-trip, and become thy bondslave?	shakespearean
Here, take this piece of jewelry.	modern
I cannot love him.	shakespearean
I’ll make division of my present with you.	shakespearean
My legs may be yellow, but I don’t feel blue.	modern
Come, boy, with me.	shakespearean
Good my mouse of virtue, answer me.	shakespearean
He’s got an answer for everything.	modern
Who saw Cesario, ho?	shakespearean
Smilest thou?	shakespearean
Won’t you be glad to see that rascal dog humiliated?	modern
No woman’s heart So big, to hold so much.	shakespearean
Just come again tomorrow.	modern
Be quick.	modern
His dishonesty appears in leaving his friend here in necessity and denying him.	shakespearean
Fare thee well.	shakespearean
Nay, I prithee, put on this gown and this beard.	shakespearean
In what chapter of his bosom?	shakespearean
Here it is.	modern
Good beauties, let me sustain no scorn.	shakespearean
Anyway, sir, should I go see the lady?	modern
Give me thy hand, And let me see thee in thy woman’s weeds.	shakespearean
Well, sir, for want of other idleness, I’ll bide your proof.	shakespearean
He’s coming, madam; but in very strange manner.	shakespearean
Cesario is your servant’s name, fair princess.	shakespearean
You’re making a terrible racket out here!	modern
He still hasn’t told us about the captain.	modern
Good night.	modern
The rules of dueling say he has to.	modern
O, if I thought that, I’d beat him like a dog!	shakespearean
Call in my maid.	modern
But I know you’d never force me to tell you things I don’t want to, so I should be polite and tell you what I can.	modern
If thou darest tempt me further, draw thy sword.	shakespearean
Good, good.	shakespearean
He’s going to look like a total idiot.	modern
Tell me what a drunk is like, fool.	modern
Know’st thou this country?	shakespearean
His eyes started glazing over around eight in the morning.	modern
Here come the officers.	shakespearean
He cut my head and gave Sir Toby a bloody head, too.	modern
Oh, he looks like a pathetic Sunday school teacher.	modern
You do mistake me, sir.	shakespearean
Well, her name’s a word, and if you fooled around with it you might make her into a whore.	modern
Malvolio’s coming down this walk.	shakespearean
If it be a suit from the count, I am sick, or not at home.	shakespearean
I know my physic will work with him.	shakespearean
Let’s go for it.	modern
Give me excess of it that, surfeiting, The appetite may sicken, and so die.	shakespearean
Do you have any doubts, Antonio?	modern
I don’t know what you’ve done to upset him, but someone has challenged you to a duel.	modern
Hello, sweet lady.	modern
If he hadn’t been drunk, he would’ve really roughed you up.	modern
If you were a woman, I’d hug you now and cry, and say “Welcome back, drowned Viola!” My father had a mole on his forehead.	modern
She did show favor to the youth in your sight only to exasperate you, to awake your dormouse valor, to put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver.	shakespearean
Why are you talking like that?	modern
Before me, she’s a good wench.	shakespearean
Come on, take us to him.	modern
To the Elephant.	shakespearean
Here he comes with your niece.	shakespearean
Or o' mine either?	shakespearean
That’s it!	modern
Good Master Fabian, grant me another request.	shakespearean
Marry, sir, they praise me and make an ass of me, now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass.	shakespearean
Good night, you amazing woman, you.	modern
Ay, madam.	shakespearean
It must be something I did accidentally.	modern
But he has promised me, as he is a gentleman and a soldier, he will not hurt you.	shakespearean
Send one presently to Sir Toby.	shakespearean
This is the air, that’s the glorious sun.	modern
For her I’ll be strange and condescending, and I’ll put on my yellow stockings and crisscross laces right away.	modern
My masters, are you mad?	shakespearean
I will help you to ’t.	shakespearean
Are you always going to be like this?	modern
A noble duke, in nature As in name.	shakespearean
It is something of my negligence, nothing of my purpose.	shakespearean
Ask me any commonsense question.	modern
Save you, gentleman.	shakespearean
Yes, by Saint Anne, and ginger shall be hot i' the mouth too.	shakespearean
What have you heard from her?	modern
I’ll pay thy pleasure then.	shakespearean
I saw thee late at the Count Orsino’s.	shakespearean
In Orsino’s bosom.	shakespearean
Do you have anything else to say?	modern
Yes, it stinks very sweetly.	modern
If thou hast her not i' the end, call me “Cut.”  If I do not, never trust me, take it how you will.	shakespearean
What’s wrong with you?	modern
Take away the fool, gentlemen.	shakespearean
How can this be?	shakespearean
Belike you slew great number of his people?	shakespearean
But who cares.	modern
Look at me now!	modern
Thou hadst need send for more money.	shakespearean
The three-beat rhythm is a good for dancing, and the church bells chime—one, two, three.	modern
Here comes the man, sir, that did rescue me.	shakespearean
What I am and what I would are as secret as maidenhead.	shakespearean
Has it been so long?	modern
Hello, sir.	modern
Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly rascally sheep-biter come by some notable shame?	shakespearean
Yes, you have to tell us why, Sir Andrew.	modern
Here’s more insanity for us.	modern
Or are you just pretending?	modern
Of your complexion.	shakespearean
But here the lady comes.	shakespearean
Yes, but I know— What do you know?	modern
Don’t you think you should go to bed, Malvolio?	modern
If he may be conveniently delivered, I would he were, for I am now so far in offense with my niece that I cannot pursue with any safety this sport to the upshot.	shakespearean
He knows I recognize him.	modern
I would be loath to cast away my speech, for besides that it is excellently well penned, I have taken great pains to con it.	shakespearean
I would you were as I would have you be!	shakespearean
But you, sir, altered that, for some hour before you took me from the breach of the sea was my sister drowned.	shakespearean
Just a bit of my dry humor, sir.	modern
Why are you leaving, my angry friend?	modern
Do it quickly.	shakespearean
It did come to his hands, and commands shall be executed.	shakespearean
And maybe a third?	modern
Why, sweetheart?	modern
I’ll come too.	modern
I’ll be back soon to wake up your generosity.	modern
I’ve only made it this far since I left her place, walking at a moderate pace.	modern
Thy reason, man?	shakespearean
And cross-gartered?	shakespearean
And on that vice in him will my revenge find notable cause to work.	shakespearean
Lady Strachy married her wardrobe manager.	modern
What could you possibly ask of me that I wouldn’t give you, as long as it didn’t damage my honor and self-respect?	modern
No, I’ll prove it with airtight evidence and logical argument.	modern
You know, he got me in trouble with the lady of the house once when I arranged a bear-baiting here.	modern
You can’t go back into the house unless you want to fight with me—and if you’re willing to do that, you might as well just go and fight with him.	modern
Meanwhile, I’ll get Sir Toby.	modern
Nothing, except your true love for my lord.	modern
Go ahead and write it down.	modern
How say you to that, Malvolio?	shakespearean
He abandoned his friend here in an emergency, and even pretended he didn’t know him.	modern
Would it be better, madam, than I am?	shakespearean
Come here, Sir Andrew.	modern
Oh, I’m talking too loud.—Where’s Malvolio?	modern
My duty, madam, and most humble service.	shakespearean
Well, she can get used to it.	modern
This savors not much of distraction.	shakespearean
I thank thee.	shakespearean
I delight in masques and revels sometimes altogether.	shakespearean
I’m not bringing any declarations of war or demands for cash.	modern
To the gates of Tartar, thou most excellent devil of wit!	shakespearean
He was a wreck, almost past hope.	modern
I am not mad, Sir Topas.	shakespearean
Thanks for your trouble.	modern
There’s money for thee.	shakespearean
I will on with my speech in your praise and then show you the heart of my message.	shakespearean
I’ll get free of you.	modern
An they be not, let them hang themselves in their own straps.	shakespearean
Come by and by to my chamber.	shakespearean
Who has done this, Sir Andrew?	shakespearean
What do you want?	modern
Besides, she uses me with a more exalted respect than anyone else that follows her.	shakespearean
What do you mean by that, Malvolio?	modern
The captain that did bring me first on shore Hath my maid’s garments.	shakespearean
And by all means see if you can get the young man to answer it.	modern
Did you never see the picture of “We Three”?	shakespearean
doth sway my life.” Nay, but first, let me see, let me see, let me see.	shakespearean
I’ll do my best To woo your lady— Whoe'er I woo, myself would be his wife.	shakespearean
This will make them both so afraid that they’ll kill each other just by looking at each other.	modern
What’s your name?	modern
But tell me true, are you not mad indeed?	shakespearean
I thank my stars I am happy.	shakespearean
Well, that proves she’s in love with you.	modern
That was excellent, really excellent.	modern
A gentleman?	modern
That’s a step in the direction of love.	modern
It was addressed to him, and orders must be obeyed.	modern
Oh, only time can sort out this mess.	modern
Well then, goodbye.	modern
My message is not for anyone else to hear, my lady.	modern
I’ll give it a try.	modern
By this hand, I am.	shakespearean
I am the man.	shakespearean
Ay, madam, well, for I was bred and born Not three hours' travel from this very place.	shakespearean
Yes, sir.	modern
So if four negatives make two affirmatives, I’m worse off because of my friends and better off because of my foes.	modern
I say, remember.	shakespearean
Of what nature the wrongs are thou hast done him, I know not, but thy intercepter, full of despite, bloody as the hunter, attends thee at the orchard end.	shakespearean
Tell me why.	shakespearean
O Lord!	shakespearean
Go, write it in a martial hand.	shakespearean
I’ll make the motion.	shakespearean
I remember his face well.	modern
And when she went away now, “Let this fellow be looked to.” “Fellow!” Not “Malvolio,” nor after my degree, but “fellow.” Why, everything adheres together, that no dram of a scruple, no scruple of a scruple, no obstacle, no incredulous or unsafe circumstance—what can be said?	shakespearean
My servant!	modern
I’d say I was “out of my element,” but that phrase is overused, so I’ll say I’m “out of my air.”	modern
Don’t ask to see this letter.	modern
Nothing can come between me and the fulfillment of all my hopes.	modern
Lead me on.	shakespearean
But wait, there’s some prose after her poem.	modern
Good Sir Toby!	shakespearean
Art thou mad?	shakespearean
Go after him and try to calm him down a little.	modern
Because then I’d have to shed an ounce or two of your impudent blood.	modern
I was never a thief or a pirate, though I admit I was your enemy for good reasons.	modern
If you will not murder me for my love, let me be your servant.	shakespearean
He’s coming, madam; but he’s acting very strangely.	modern
So cheer up, there’s still hope for you, man.	modern
An you love me, let’s do ’t.	shakespearean
You’re absolutely right.	modern
Save thee, friend, and thy music.	shakespearean
Do you not hear, fellows?	shakespearean
Sing us a song.	modern
You don’t know me.	modern
Orsino, noble sir, Be pleased that I shake off these names you give me.	shakespearean
Sooth, but you must.	shakespearean
I wish I could work for that lady!	modern
And some have greatness thrust upon them.” Heaven help you!	modern
I’d give forty pounds to be safe at home right now.	modern
If you’re someone who gets into fights, I’ll fight with you.	modern
What’s that?	shakespearean
Damn that Toby!	modern
If it will not, what remedy?	shakespearean
Go off, I discard you.	shakespearean
I could really use his advice right now.	modern
Ah, no.	modern
I prithee now, ungird thy strangeness and tell me what I shall vent to my lady.	shakespearean
What, what?	shakespearean
If I miss this, let me be boiled alive.	modern
Please, keep it to yourself.	modern
For some reason he’s in prison now on some legal technicality, on Malvolio’s orders.	modern
I am no more mad than you are.	shakespearean
Doth he not mend?	shakespearean
She is not worth thee, then.	shakespearean
If that this simple syllogism will serve, so.	shakespearean
I will not give my part of this sport for a pension of thousands to be paid from the Sophy.	shakespearean
Well, let it be.— What ho, Malvolio!	shakespearean
Who treated you badly?	modern
Why are you bothering this poor man!	modern
We’ll whisper o'er a couplet or two of most sage saws.	shakespearean
Wise men who give fools money might get a good reputation—if they keep up regular payments for fourteen years.	modern
But then he said strange things to me.	modern
Should we go see the sights in the town?	modern
Go ahead.	modern
But I’m still fairly high-ranking.	modern
Yes, yes.	modern
I can hardly forbear hurling things at him.	shakespearean
If that’s true, which it is, she might as well be in love with a dream, the poor lady.	modern
Here come the conspirators.	modern
Malvolio’s coming down the path.	modern
Thou dost speak masterly.	shakespearean
See him delivered, Fabian; bring him hither.	shakespearean
Go to him, Sir Topas.	modern
I don’t think a team of oxen could get them close enough to fight.	modern
If you’ve offended him, I’ll fight you.	modern
I’ll have you two hide—and the fool too—right where he’ll find the letter.	modern
You’ll introduce me to him as a eunuch.	modern
Let still the woman take An elder than herself.	shakespearean
How are you, my friend?	modern
But in my conscience, sir, I do not care for you.	shakespearean
Oh, no question—it won’t style itself.	modern
That’s true.	modern
You have my word as a gentleman that I’ll always be grateful to you.	modern
Fabian, bring him here.	modern
He’s a coward, a total coward.	modern
But maybe by some fluke he was saved too.	modern
Come, sir, away.	shakespearean
Take him away!	modern
I am a fellow o' th' strangest mind i' th' world.	shakespearean
And I too?	modern
Oh, if it prove, Tempests are kind and salt waves fresh in love!	shakespearean
To him, Sir Topas.	shakespearean
This does make some obstruction in the blood, this cross-gartering, but what of that?	shakespearean
What is your name?	shakespearean
M.O.A.I.” This simulation is not as the former, and yet to crush this a little, it would bow to me, for every one of these letters are in my name.	shakespearean
What is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning wildfowl?	shakespearean
What say you sir?	shakespearean
Here’s some money for you.	modern
Antonio, O my dear Antonio!	shakespearean
Give me now leave to leave thee.	shakespearean
You call this house dark?	modern
It doesn’t matter how I am: he hurt me, and that’s that.	modern
Fool, I’ll repay you for this favor.	modern
Nay, that’s certain.	shakespearean
Nay, I’ll ne'er believe a madman till I see his brains.	shakespearean
Pox on ’t!	shakespearean
Hello, you idiot.	modern
Thou know’st not me.	shakespearean
By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier o' nights.	shakespearean
But he’d been there before me, and they told me he’d gone out looking for me.	modern
Only myself stood out; For which, if I be lapsèd in this place, I shall pay dear.	shakespearean
Tomorrow you need to get more money sent to you.	modern
The gentleness of all the gods go with thee!	shakespearean
My lord and master loves you.	shakespearean
Meanwhile, I’ll think of some horrible way to phrase the challenge.	modern
This will so fright them both that they will kill one another by the look, like cockatrices.	shakespearean
What is fated to happen must happen.	modern
Challenge me the count’s youth to fight with him.	shakespearean
Cesario, come here.	modern
Everyone, please leave us alone for a moment.	modern
He’s a fool and a spendthrift.	modern
Get you all three into the boxtree.	shakespearean
Come, sir, I will not let you go.	shakespearean
Show me the way.	modern
Why not?	modern
I could not stay behind you.	shakespearean
What manner of man?	shakespearean
Would it be better if I were that, instead of what I am?	modern
It doesn’t sound as sweet as it did before.	modern
Why, he has three thousand ducats a year.	shakespearean
Will you deny me now?	shakespearean
A duke who is noble in name and character.	modern
There’s a lot to learn when a fool recites the words of a madman.	modern
I saw you at Count Orsino’s recently.	modern
I’ll serve this duke.	shakespearean
Go ahead.	modern
to fool) Is thy lady within?	shakespearean
How is’t with you, sir?	shakespearean
Are you still so cruel?	modern
His life I gave him and did thereto add My love, without retention or restraint, All his in dedication.	shakespearean
Is he talking nonsense?	modern
Sir Topas, Sir Topas, good Sir Topas, please go find my lady Olivia— Get out, demon!	modern
No, faith, I’ll not stay a jot longer.	shakespearean
Tis not for gravity to play at cherry-pit with Satan.	shakespearean
Virtue is beauty, but the beauteous evil Are empty trunks o'erflourished by the devil.	shakespearean
She flirted with the messenger boy to exasperate you, fire up your passions, and make you angry and jealous.	modern
I have to obey.	modern
A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell.	shakespearean
Was he sent by Count Orsino?	modern
From soldiers.	modern
Where lies your text?	shakespearean
By my troth, thou hast an open hand.	shakespearean
Oh, hello, father!	modern
I could marry that Maria for thinking this up.	modern
Tell me your mind.	shakespearean
He hath been most notoriously abused.	shakespearean
Be the person you know you are, and you’ll be as powerful as this person you fear.	modern
But who is this person, sir?	modern
Fabian can scarce hold him yonder.	shakespearean
Alas the day!	shakespearean
But we are prevented.	shakespearean
Put them to motion.	shakespearean
Is that really what you meant?	modern
I’ll do my best to make this lady love you.	modern
Now talk to him in your own voice, and tell me how he is.	modern
Ay, is ’t, I warrant him.	shakespearean
So that, conclusions to be as kisses, if your four negatives make your two affirmatives, why then the worse for my friends and the better for my foes.	shakespearean
Blab my nonsense!	modern
I think it well, my lord.	shakespearean
I think we know whose fancy handwriting that was.	modern
But I know to be up late is to be up late.	shakespearean
A blank, my lord.	shakespearean
And when she left just now, she said “Take care of this poor fellow here.” Fellow!” Not “Malvolio,” not anything referring to my low station in life, but “fellow.” Everything’s going perfectly.	modern
I can say little more than I have studied, and that question’s out of my part.	shakespearean
My gentleman, Cesario?	shakespearean
He is very well-favored, and he speaks very shrewishly.	shakespearean
Oh, I thank my lucky stars, I’m so happy.	modern
Are they like to take dust, like Mistress Mall’s picture?	shakespearean
I have no exquisite reason for ’t, but I have reason good enough.	shakespearean
Like medicine for a sick man.	modern
Aren’t you Lady Olivia’s fool?	modern
It doth not fit me.	shakespearean
Madam, yond young fellow swears he will speak with you.	shakespearean
It might have since been answered in repaying What we took from them, which, for traffic’s sake, Most of our city did.	shakespearean
No, sir, I won’t let you go.	modern
Art thou good at these kickshawses, knight?	shakespearean
It’s only for your willing and receptive ear.	modern
Tell her my love is purer than anything else in the whole world, and has nothing to do with her property.	modern
I know I’m not fooling myself, or letting myself get carried away by my imagination, because every clue points to the fact that Lady Olivia loves me.	modern
I would not so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace.	shakespearean
I pray you, keep it in.	shakespearean
I respect the soul very much, so I disagree with his belief.	modern
I am, unless I somehow stole this role.	modern
By the way, I’m going home tomorrow, Sir Toby.	modern
He knows I know him well.	shakespearean
Are they likely to get dusty?	modern
He is not here, so please your lordship, that should sing it.	shakespearean
If only his lord were more like him.	modern
As for his cowardliness, ask Fabian.	modern
But please forgive me, darling, for the sake of the vows we made to each other so recently.	modern
He did me kindness, sir, drew on my side, But in conclusion put strange speech upon me.	shakespearean
Then you really are insane, if you’re no saner than a fool.	modern
Fare thee well.	shakespearean
I’ll write thee a challenge.	shakespearean
I’m just wandering, with no particular destination.	modern
Get him to say his prayers, Sir Toby, get him to pray.	modern
She took the ring of me.	shakespearean
If you desire the spleen, and will laugh yourself into stitches, follow me.	shakespearean
His letter’s going to be hilarious.	modern
Away with him.	shakespearean
By this hand, they are scoundrels and substractors that say so of him.	shakespearean
There is no obstruction in this.	shakespearean
How quickly the wrong side may be turned outward!	shakespearean
I’m surprised you enjoy the company of this stupid troublemaker.	modern
Neither would I.	modern
A little, by your favor.	shakespearean
No, not a grize.	shakespearean
No, believe me.	shakespearean
I wish you all the best.	modern
Fight to the death” is his motto.	modern
Is that the meaning of “accost”?	shakespearean
He’s a fool, a madman, and a drowned man.	modern
Let some of my people have a special care of him.	shakespearean
If it please the eye of one, it is with me as the very true sonnet is, “Please one, and please all.”  Why, how dost thou, man?	shakespearean
Are you good at those kinds of things?	modern
I know his soul’s in heaven, fool.	modern
Shall I be your slave?	modern
My brother is in heaven.	modern
In what chapter and verse of his heart?	modern
Then lead the way, father.	modern
Twere as good a deed as to drink when a man’s a-hungry, to challenge him the field and then to break promise with him and make a fool of him.	shakespearean
It’s possible, ma'am.	modern
Here’s money for you.	modern
This is a practise As full of labor as a wise man’s art, For folly that he wisely shows is fit.	shakespearean
My father had a daughter who loved a man in the same way that I might love you, if I were a woman.	modern
I will make your peace with him if I can.	shakespearean
If this young gentleman Have done offence, I take the fault on me.	shakespearean
Her husband, sirrah?	shakespearean
It is the more like to be feigned.	shakespearean
Take away this fool, gentlemen.	modern
No, sir, no jot.	shakespearean
Ah, the countess is coming!	modern
You’ve shut me up in a dark room and given your drunken cousin authority over me, but I’m as sane as you are.	modern
rules my life.” Hmm, let me see, let me see, let me see.	modern
You are now out of your text.	shakespearean
Ourselves we do not owe.	shakespearean
I do not now fool myself, to let imagination jade me, for every reason excites to this, that my lady loves me.	shakespearean
He named Sebastian.	shakespearean
She did compliment me on my yellow stockings recently, and she said she liked how the crisscross laces looked on my legs.	modern
His very genius hath taken the infection of the device, man.	shakespearean
But we will draw the curtain and show you the picture.	shakespearean
Nay, good Sir Toby.	shakespearean
Then you’re a fool for being sad that your brother’s soul is in heaven.	modern
Are you an actor?	modern
Yet I wish I could.	modern
Yes, that’s the one.	modern
I represent her.	modern
Please let me be your servant so I can be with you.	modern
No woman’s heart is big enough to hold all my love.	modern
These two people are as identical as two halves of an apple.	modern
What can I say to him, lady?	modern
Which one of you is the lady of the house?	modern
She’s a beagle, true-bred, and one that adores me.	shakespearean
Leave me alone.	modern
He will find it comes from a clodpole.	shakespearean
Leave them alone until he sets off home, and then follow him.	modern
You shall know more hereafter.	shakespearean
What is decreed must be, and be this so.	shakespearean
He made my heart leap for you.	modern
How now?	shakespearean
Perchance he is not drown’d.—What think you, sailors?	shakespearean
Will either of you give him the message that I’m challenging him to a duel?	modern
I refuse to accept that.	modern
Apparently you think there’s nothing unusual about a bloody head.	modern
Sometimes all I want to do is see plays and go out dancing.	modern
But here she comes.	modern
But oops, when I let go of your hand, I let go of the biggest joke of all.	modern
My purpose is, indeed, a horse of that color.	shakespearean
I will acquit you.	shakespearean
I’ll have to do something courageous then, because I hate intrigue.	modern
But I’ll open the curtain and let you see the picture.	modern
My friends, are you all Lady Olivia’s servants?	modern
Make him think you’re Sir Topas the priest.	modern
And so adieu, good madam.	shakespearean
What country is this, friends?	modern
Let’s go to bed, knight.	modern
These wise men that give fools money get themselves a good report—after fourteen years' purchase.	shakespearean
Still in this fashion, color, ornament, For him I imitate.	shakespearean
You’re better off because of your friends.	modern
Will either of you bear me a challenge to him?	shakespearean
I’m not insane, Sir Topas.	modern
It is perchance that you yourself were saved.	shakespearean
Yes, good fool.	modern
Tell him not to send any more messengers—unless you feel like coming back to tell me how he took the bad news.	modern
It’s true she looked at me a lot, in fact, she looked at me so much that she seemed distracted, and couldn’t really finish her sentences very well.	modern
The gentleman will, for his honor’s sake, have one bout with you.	shakespearean
A devil like you could lead me to hell.	modern
What would you do about it?	modern
What, to perverseness?	shakespearean
Ready to set sail, sir?	modern
No, good Sir Toby.	modern
Ay, husband.	shakespearean
For his thoughts, Would they were blanks, rather than fill’d with me.	shakespearean
But you’d still be gorgeous even if you were as proud as the devil.	modern
I must obey.	shakespearean
We thought he was a coward, but he fights like a devil.	modern
Not so, sir, I do care for something.	shakespearean
To be Count Malvolio!	shakespearean
It is heresy.	shakespearean
Who of my people hold him in delay?	shakespearean
My most exquisite Sir Topas!	shakespearean
Talkest thou nothing but of ladies?	shakespearean
The devil inside him is rough, but we can’t treat it roughly.	modern
Come here!	modern
But I perceive in you so excellent a touch of modesty that you will not extort from me what I am willing to keep in.	shakespearean
I tell you, this house is as dark as ignorance.	modern
Maria once told me she did affect me, and I have heard herself come thus near, that, should she fancy, it should be one of my complexion.	shakespearean
Look you, sir, such a one I was this present.	shakespearean
Although many people said she looked like me, she was considered beautiful.	modern
Meanwhile, let’s go to bed and dream about this.	modern
Nay, pursue him now, lest the device take air and taint.	shakespearean
Why, it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes, and the clerestories toward the south-north are as lustrous as ebony.	shakespearean
Excuse me, sir, do you know anything about this?	modern
Now please stop being so strange and tell me what exactly I should blab to my lady.	modern
Sport royal, I warrant you.	shakespearean
Nay, let him alone.	shakespearean
Anyone who says that is a lying piece of garbage.	modern
Let me be clear of thee.	shakespearean
Marry, will I, sir.	shakespearean
But silence, like a knife, cuts open my heart With strokes that draw no blood.	modern
Once more, Cesario, Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty.	shakespearean
He is sad and civil And suits well for a servant with my fortunes.	shakespearean
He’s conducting some business with my lady, and sooner or later he’ll leave.	modern
Can’t you talk about anything besides ladies?	modern
Ay, my lord, this same.	shakespearean
Should we sing a round to wake up the night owl?	modern
I told them to take  Oh, what a big mistake!	modern
Why, we shall make him mad indeed.	shakespearean
I am sure no man hath any quarrel to me.	shakespearean
And as for what I promised to you, I’m as good as my word.	modern
I will be proud, I will read politic authors, I will baffle Sir Toby, I will wash off gross acquaintance, I will be point- devise the very man.	shakespearean
Did she see thee the while, old boy?	shakespearean
Come, put it over my face.	modern
How strange I’m feeling!	modern
Did she see you there the whole time, old boy?	modern
A coward, a most devout coward, religious in it.	shakespearean
My servant, sir!	shakespearean
Oh, I really think she loves me!	modern
I’m being gentle with you, because I’m one of those good-hearted people who are polite to the devil himself.	modern
This guy’s wise enough to play the fool, and only clever people can do that.	modern
No, madam, I do but read madness.	shakespearean
You might have a great opportunity to give it to him right now.	modern
Don’t worry about me.	modern
No, my lord, not I. Alas, it is the baseness of thy fear That makes thee strangle thy propriety.	shakespearean
Come on, put your sword away, my little soldier.	modern
No, my lord, not me.	modern
At your request!	shakespearean
What would you?	shakespearean
And for that I promised you, I’ll be as good as my word.	shakespearean
Fool, fool, fool, I say!	shakespearean
You probably killed a lot of his men?	modern
Ah, I’m an odd kind of guy.	modern
If you be not mad, be gone.	shakespearean
You should then have accosted her, and with some excellent jests, fire-new from the mint, you should have banged the youth into dumbness.	shakespearean
They that add, moreover, he’s drunk nightly in your company.	shakespearean
This is going to be great!	modern
My enemies help me understand myself better, which is an advantage, and my friends help me lie about myself, which is a disadvantage.	modern
Never trust me again if I don’t.	modern
Your ladyship were best to have some guard about you if he come, for sure the man is tainted in ’s wits.	shakespearean
I’m not holding your hand, sir.	modern
I have not seen such a firago.	shakespearean
Cesario, come, For so you shall be, while you are a man.	shakespearean
If it be thus to dream, still let me sleep!	shakespearean
I didn’t give her any ring.	modern
I don’t have any “brilliant” reason for it, but I have a good enough reason.	modern
I’ll bet anything you like that nothing will happen, once again.	modern
And some have greatness thrust upon them.” Heaven restore thee!	shakespearean
I’ll write out a detailed inventory of my beauty and label every part.	modern
Madam, there is at the gate a young gentleman much desires to speak with you.	shakespearean
Come thy ways, Signior Fabian.	shakespearean
How are you?	modern
I have sent after him.	shakespearean
I will answer you with gait and entrance.	shakespearean
Thy smiles become thee well.	shakespearean
Out of my sight!— Be not offended, dear Cesario.— Rudesby, be gone!	shakespearean
I thank you.	shakespearean
Prithee, be content.	shakespearean
Oh, you’re a naughty one, encouraging double-dealing.	modern
Come with me, boy.	modern
Now, you lie there on the path.	modern
Ay, marry, what is he?	shakespearean
But did your sister die of love?	modern
Madam, that young man out there says he’s got to speak to you.	modern
It’s my duty to be quiet.	modern
Lead me on.	shakespearean
What a plague means my niece, to take the death of her brother thus?	shakespearean
To anger him, we’ll have the bear again, and we will fool him black and blue.	shakespearean
Why, what are you?	shakespearean
Madam, the young gentleman of the Count Orsino’s is returned.	shakespearean
Didn’t you hear her, guys?	modern
I’ll drink to her as long as there is a passage in my throat and drink in Illyria.	shakespearean
No, madam.	modern
Who are you?	modern
Out o' tune, sir.	shakespearean
I know not, madam.	shakespearean
Orsino, sir, please don’t call me those names.	modern
The house will be the quieter.	shakespearean
Yes, but who is he?	modern
Will you help me?—What an ass and a fool, a gullible no-good idiot!	modern
Tell him he’s not going to speak with me.	modern
Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing, Though, I confess, much like the character.	shakespearean
Can he deny it?	modern
I could challenge him to a duel and then not show up.	modern
Dearest Olivia— What do you have to say for yourself, Cesario?—My lord, please— My lord wants to speak.	modern
I pray you, sir, what is he?	shakespearean
This is just what the letter said.	modern
Marry, sir, lullaby to your bounty till I come again.	shakespearean
Now Mercury endue thee with leasing, for thou speakest well of fools!	shakespearean
Madam, I am most apt to embrace your offer.	shakespearean
A stoup of wine!	shakespearean
Now let’s have a catch.	shakespearean
With drinking healths to my niece.	shakespearean
So goodbye, my lady.	modern
What’s going on?	modern
He’s only known you for three days, but he’s already treating you like a close friend.	modern
He left behind him myself and a sister, both born in an hour.	shakespearean
I think we do know the sweet Roman hand.	shakespearean
And on the answer, he pays you as surely as your feet hit the ground they step on.	shakespearean
This shall end without the perdition of souls.	shakespearean
You’ll find it otherwise, I assure you.	shakespearean
Do you know what you say?	shakespearean
All the rest of you can leave too.	modern
I say, there is no darkness but ignorance, in which thou art more puzzled than the Egyptians in their fog.	shakespearean
She’s a good little woman, and she adores me.	modern
What’s the obvious conclusion from that?	modern
The Count’s gentleman, one Cesario.	shakespearean
She is drowned already, sir, with salt water, though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more.	shakespearean
If you can separate yourself and your misdemeanors, you are welcome to the house.	shakespearean
I can do anything!	modern
Put your sword away.	modern
She did commend my yellow stockings of late, she did praise my leg being cross-gartered, and in this she manifests herself to my love, and with a kind of injunction, drives me to these habits of her liking.	shakespearean
Can you do that?	modern
He takes on him to understand so much, and therefore comes to speak with you.	shakespearean
That’s the weakness I’ll use to get revenge on him.	modern
I mean, to go, sir, to enter.	shakespearean
The table of contents says it’s in the first chapter of his heart.	modern
Twill endure wind and weather.	shakespearean
Thou shalt not choose but go.	shakespearean
Sir, no.	shakespearean
Well, he keeps the devil away as well as a man can in his situation.	modern
Where’s the passage of holy scripture that you’re basing your sermon on?	modern
If that be to care for nothing, sir, I would it would make you invisible.	shakespearean
I’ll drink to her as long as there’s a hole in my throat and booze in Illyria.	modern
I bet you’re a happy fellow who doesn’t care about anything.	modern
Tell him he shall not speak with me.	shakespearean
Jove, I thank thee!	shakespearean
I’d be very grateful to you if you did.	modern
If I do not usurp myself, I am.	shakespearean
I think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb.	shakespearean
What country, friends, is this?	shakespearean
Here she comes, the brilliant fool-catcher.	modern
Which one is Sebastian?	modern
No trouble, sir.	modern
Thou shalt not be the worse for me: there’s gold.	shakespearean
I would not have him miscarry for the half of my dowry.	shakespearean
If he’s got a message from the count, tell him I’m sick, or not home.	modern
Ever since the Duke’s messenger visited Olivia, she’s been upset.	modern
And by all means stir on the youth to an answer.	shakespearean
I swear to God, madam, you’ve wronged me, and I’ll tell the whole world.	modern
I take pleasure in singing, sir.	shakespearean
Vent my folly?	shakespearean
I wish I were something better, because right now I’m a big fool.	modern
Make me a willow cabin at your gate And call upon my soul within the house.	shakespearean
What does  You’d have a great hairstyle if you had.	modern
Antonio, oh my dear Antonio!	modern
Sir Toby, madam, your relative.	modern
Oh, Sir Toby, stop!	modern
I am as mad as he, If sad and merry madness equal be.	shakespearean
Please smile whenever you’re near me, my dearest darling.”	modern
Or what are you?	shakespearean
Stop, Sir Toby!	modern
For the love of God, a surgeon!	shakespearean
Oh, say so, and so be!	shakespearean
I tell thee, I am as well in my wits as any man in Illyria.	shakespearean
That’s the truth.	modern
No, please, read it like a sane person.	modern
I hate it as an unfilled can.	shakespearean
As I am a gentleman, I will live to be thankful to thee for ’t.	shakespearean
Come on, sir, let’s go.	modern
No, leave him alone.	modern
She’s sending this ring back to you, sir.	modern
My duty hushes me.	shakespearean
Ay, ay.	shakespearean
He has broke my head across and has given Sir Toby a bloody coxcomb too.	shakespearean
A good person who does something wrong is only patched up with sin.	modern
If the heavens had been pleased, would we had so ended!	shakespearean
Very brief, and to exceeding good sense—less.	shakespearean
Beshrew his soul for me!	shakespearean
Shall we not, Sir Andrew?	shakespearean
I’m telling the truth.	modern
You’re wrong, you madman.	modern
Therefore perpend, my princess, and give ear.	shakespearean
I shall be much bound to you for ’t.	shakespearean
Who does do you wrong?	shakespearean
No, my profound heart.	shakespearean
Let him send no more— Unless perchance you come to me again To tell me how he takes it.	shakespearean
He’s very handsome and speaks well, but he’s very young.	modern
What wouldst thou now?	shakespearean
Sebastian was my father’s name, and my brother was named Sebastian too.	modern
I had a pass with him, rapier, scabbard, and all, and he gives me the stuck-in with such a mortal motion, that it is inevitable.	shakespearean
I’ve never seen such a monster.	modern
I’ll do everything she wants me to do.	modern
He looks like he just recently stopped breastfeeding.	modern
Then he’s a rogue, and a passy-measures pavin.	shakespearean
He really is the most skillful, bloodthirsty, and dangerous opponent you can find in Illyria.	modern
Remain thou still in darkness.	shakespearean
A good knave.	shakespearean
I’m sure nobody would have any reason to fight with me.	modern
Hast thou forgot thyself?	shakespearean
If this is a dream, let me keep on sleeping!	modern
There’s a picture of me inside.	modern
Nay, if you be an undertaker, I am for you.	shakespearean
So, let me hear you speak.	shakespearean
He claimed he knew that, and that’s why he’s come to speak with you.	modern
We took him for a coward, but he’s the very devil incardinate.	shakespearean
Will you help?—An ass-head, and a coxcomb, and a knave, a thin-faced knave, a gull!	shakespearean
Seven of my people, with an obedient start, make out for him.	shakespearean
Though I struck him first, yet it’s no matter for that.	shakespearean
Yes, madam.	modern
You should have a guard nearby if he comes in here, because he’s clearly disturbed.	modern
I sent for thee upon a sad occasion.	shakespearean
No pains, sir.	shakespearean
I have limed her, but it is Jove’s doing, and Jove make me thankful!	shakespearean
Oh, if it turns out to be true that he survived, then that storm was kind, and the ocean was full of love!	modern
Tell me why you did it.	modern
What shall we do else?	shakespearean
Will you hoist sail, sir?	shakespearean
You, uncivil lady, To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars My soul the faithfull’st off'rings have breathed out That e'er devotion tendered—what shall I do?	shakespearean
Make him believe thou art Sir Topas the curate.	shakespearean
Were we not born under Taurus?	shakespearean
No, not at all.	modern
Go where, my lord?—Cesario, my husband, stay here.	modern
I’m everywhere.	modern
I don’t care if all the devils in hell crammed together to possess him, I still want to speak to him.	modern
But you began so rudely.	modern
Look out for him in the corner of the orchard as if you were a sheriff’s deputy.	modern
We’ll have another bear-baiting just to make him angry, and we’ll mock him till he’s black and blue.	modern
I could marry this wench for this device.	shakespearean
Like a drowned man, a fool and a madman.	shakespearean
Truly, sir, the better for my foes and the worse for my friends.	shakespearean
That’s true.	modern
Actually, their hearts are as sensitive and loyal as ours are.	modern
Don’t worry about me not swearing enough.	modern
I should have given ’t you today morning, but as a madman’s epistles are no gospels, so it skills not much when they are delivered.	shakespearean
Hang him, foul collier!	shakespearean
Who hath made this havoc with them?	shakespearean
And you can’t deny evidence and argument—They’ve been around since Noah’s ark.	modern
I was adored once too.	shakespearean
Let him approach.	shakespearean
Lips, do not move; No man must know.”	shakespearean
Fare you well.	shakespearean
Therefore this letter, being so excellently ignorant, will breed no terror in the youth.	shakespearean
I’ll be thrilled.	modern
Oh, I’d never be that cruel.	modern
Stand here, make a good show on ’t.	shakespearean
Draw your sword and get on your toes, because your assailant is quick, skillful, and deadly.	modern
Be a nice fool and help me find a candle and some paper.	modern
There is no way but this, Sir Andrew.	shakespearean
Do you even know what you’re talking about?	modern
No, I do not know you, nor I am not sent to you by my lady, to bid you come speak with her, nor your name is not Master Cesario, nor this is not my nose neither.	shakespearean
Mine did too.	modern
While I waited, I’d frown impatiently, and perhaps wind my watch, or play with my—with some expensive piece of jewelry I happen to be wearing.	modern
Yes, if you kept them together and invested them.	modern
Since the youth of the count’s was today with thy lady, she is much out of quiet.	shakespearean
There’s something in ’t That is deceivable.	shakespearean
How now, my hearts!	shakespearean
I had as lief be a Brownist as a politician.	shakespearean
Anyway, what should we do?	modern
Oh, beautiful and accomplished lady, may the heavens rain odors upon you!	modern
But yet I cannot love him; He might have took his answer long ago.	shakespearean
But to read his right wits is to read thus.	shakespearean
How now?	shakespearean
That our grandmother’s soul could end up inhabiting a bird.	modern
Don’t give up yet.	modern
They certainly will.	modern
Get me some ink, paper, and a candle.	modern
Have you no more to say?	shakespearean
An ’t be any way, it must be with valor, for policy I hate.	shakespearean
Marry, and it shall be done tomorrow morning if I live.	shakespearean
But oh, what a deceiver he turned out to be!	modern
Give me your hand and let me see you dressed in woman’s clothing.	modern
Dismount thy tuck, be yare in thy preparation, for thy assailant is quick, skillful and deadly.	shakespearean
He’s a very dishonest, puny boy, and more cowardly than a rabbit.	modern
I am bound to your niece, sir.	shakespearean
That duke who lives nearby is courting her.	modern
I’ll follow the priest and go with you; and after I’ve sworn to be faithful, I’ll be faithful forever.	modern
It won’t annoy you like me, because it doesn’t have a voice.	modern
If we don’t, it’ll be the biggest disappointment of our lives.	modern
I’ll ride your horse as well as I ride you.	shakespearean
Who said that?	modern
Sebastian was my father; Such a Sebastian was my brother too, So went he suited to his watery tomb.	shakespearean
To bed!	modern
Even now, sir.	shakespearean
You’re serious enough to know not to play games with Satan.	modern
You shall hear more.	shakespearean
Besides, you grow dishonest.	shakespearean
I’m as crazy as he is, if sad craziness and happy craziness are equivalent.	modern
Who are they?	shakespearean
A good lenten answer.	shakespearean
What can I give you that you want, my lord, except the one thing you can’t have?	modern
How are you, my golden girl?	modern
Ay, good fool.	shakespearean
I could be sad.	shakespearean
If only I could somehow relate them to me!	modern
Let all the rest give place.	shakespearean
I do remember.	shakespearean
I say, this house is as dark as ignorance, though ignorance were as dark as hell.	shakespearean
Twas never merry world Since lowly feigning was call’d compliment.	shakespearean
What, faithful to being mean and nasty?	modern
You may have very fit occasion for ’t.	shakespearean
They eat too much and get indigestion and nausea.	modern
I know thee well.	shakespearean
Madam, please let me see your face.	modern
I’ll give it back to you.	modern
That’s excellent.	modern
Give me too much of it, so I’ll get sick of it and stop loving.	modern
You should be ashamed of yourself, Satan, you liar!	modern
How now, gentleman?	shakespearean
Give us the place alone.	shakespearean
His eyes were set at eight i' the morning.	shakespearean
No, madam, I’m just reading an insane letter.	modern
Well, God give them wisdom that have it.	shakespearean
Observe his construction of it.	shakespearean
Whence came you, sir?	shakespearean
You’re right.	modern
I swear I will— Come on, let’s go see what happens.	modern
You may leave.	modern
Yes, she saw me quite clearly.	modern
He’s very serious, which is right for someone in mourning like me.	modern
I may command where I adore.” Why, she may command me.	shakespearean
I pity you.	shakespearean
What o' that?	shakespearean
I want to be this Duke’s servant.	modern
I saw it in the orchard.	modern
Peace, you rogue, no more o' that.	shakespearean
He will bear you easily and reins well.	shakespearean
Will you go hunt, my lord?	shakespearean
But this is from my commission.	shakespearean
Run after that obnoxious messenger, the duke’s servant.	modern
Cesario, you missed your appointment with me.	modern
You have not seen such a thing as ’tis.	shakespearean
To bed?	shakespearean
Sure thing, we’ll do it tomorrow morning.	modern
You speak so highly of fools!	modern
But tell me honestly, are you sure you’re not insane?	modern
No, I’m telling you, put on this robe and beard.	modern
Sir Toby needs help right away.	modern
And you, sir.	shakespearean
Not black in my mind, though yellow in my legs.	shakespearean
Say that some lady, as perhaps there is, Hath for your love a great a pang of heart As you have for Olivia.	shakespearean
Please, sir, be quiet.	modern
Well, go thy way.	shakespearean
My lady bade me tell you, that, though she harbors you as her kinsman, she’s nothing allied to your disorders.	shakespearean
It’s too late to go to bed now.	modern
There is a fair behavior in thee, captain, And though that nature with a beauteous wall Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee I will believe thou hast a mind that suits With this thy fair and outward character.	shakespearean
Nor I neither.	shakespearean
Why, what’s the matter?	shakespearean
What kind of woman is’t?	shakespearean
Be pointed and brief.	modern
He’s as tall a man as any ’s in Illyria.	shakespearean
If that means I don’t care about anything, you should disappear right now, since you’re nothing.	modern
Troth, sir, I can yield you none without words, and words are grown so false, I am loath to prove reason with them.	shakespearean
Alas, that they are so, To die even when they to perfection grow!	shakespearean
But it has bay windows that are as transparent as stone walls, and the upper windows facing south-north are as clear as coal.	modern
M”—why, that begins my name.	shakespearean
A spirit I am indeed, But am in that dimension grossly clad Which from the womb I did participate.	shakespearean
Sir, I bade them take away you.	shakespearean
Remember who liked your yellow stockings—” Your yellow stockings?	modern
God will protect me.	modern
Sir, you need a drink.	modern
O good Antonio, forgive me your trouble.	shakespearean
Some achieve greatness—” What sayest thou?	shakespearean
If that’s true, I think the same thing about you.	modern
I warrant thou art a merry fellow and carest for nothing.	shakespearean
I wish you were what I wanted you to be!	modern
He’s just as terrified of Sir Andrew.	modern
Orsino, this is that Antonio That took the  And this is he that did the  When your young nephew Titus lost his leg.	shakespearean
It’s really the only way, Sir Andrew.	modern
I’ll write a letter challenging him to a duel on your behalf.	modern
Let him be the devil, an he will, I care not.	shakespearean
Oh, please, I’m begging you, don’t mention him again.	modern
And so perchance may he be.	shakespearean
Women are like roses: the moment their beauty is in full bloom, it’s about to decay.	modern
Notable pirate!	shakespearean
He hath not told us of the captain yet.	shakespearean
Sir Toby, I must be round with you.	shakespearean
Ah, how will this all turn out?	modern
Here comes my noble gull-catcher.	shakespearean
He has been yonder i' the sun practising behavior to his own shadow this half hour.	shakespearean
My dear lady— Please let me say something, I’m begging you.	modern
For the love of God, call a doctor!	modern
A contagious breath.	shakespearean
I’ll go to him.	modern
Noble people don’t answer to peasants!	modern
In his heart?	modern
Why, sir, her name’s a word, and to dally with that word might make my sister wanton.	shakespearean
Get the lady out of here.	modern
Are you her husband, boy?	modern
I shall answer for her.	shakespearean
Primo, secundo, tertio is a good play, and the old saying is, the third pays for all.	shakespearean
Soft, here follows prose.	shakespearean
Think of me as you please.	shakespearean
So find someone younger to love, or you won’t be able to maintain your feelings.	modern
Come, my young soldier, put up your iron.	shakespearean
I can’t let my lips say his name; “No man must know.”	modern
I hate ingratitude more in a man Than lying, vainness, babbling, drunkenness, Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption Inhabits our frail blood—    O heavens themselves!	shakespearean
Are you Sebastian?	modern
Why are you acting so brazen toward my lady?	modern
Fie, thou dishonest Satan!	shakespearean
Tell me what you want.	modern
One draught above heat makes him a fool, the second mads him, and a third drowns him.	shakespearean
Gentlewoman, my lady calls.	shakespearean
Nay, I am for all waters.	shakespearean
I am a spirit, yes, since I have a soul.	modern
You threw it at her rudely, and she wants you to take it back.	modern
Come on, Sir Andrew, there’s nothing you can do about it.	modern
Me too.	modern
Why, what’s the matter with him?	modern
Antonio, you’re under arrest on the orders of Count Orsino.	modern
How have the hours racked and tortured me Since I have lost thee!	shakespearean
He’ll just think an idiot wrote it.	modern
Are you all crazy?	modern
Dear lad, believe it.	shakespearean
You might have saved me my pains to have taken it away yourself.	shakespearean
I don’t think so, my lord.	modern
You know, he brought me out o' favor with my lady about a bear-baiting here.	shakespearean
It looks great.	modern
Is it a world to hide virtues in?	shakespearean
I am bound to the Count Orsino’s court.	shakespearean
If this logic works, that’s great.	modern
That’s true.	modern
What an idiotic place this world is.	modern
Good Maria, let this fellow be looked to.	shakespearean
I say to you this house is dark.	shakespearean
Madam, Count Orsino’s young messenger has returned.	modern
No, sir, not at all.	modern
We only drink toasts to my niece.	modern
Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent.	shakespearean
Good fool, some ink, paper, and light, and convey what I will set down to my lady.	shakespearean
You can fool no more money out of me at this throw.	shakespearean
I will meditate the while upon some horrid message for a challenge.	shakespearean
And I, most jocund, apt, and willingly, To do you rest, a thousand deaths would die.	shakespearean
I certainly will, sir.	modern
Come on, get ready.	modern
I don’t want to have anything to do with you anymore.	modern
To him in thine own voice, and bring me word how thou findest him.	shakespearean
I think his soul is in hell, madonna.	shakespearean
Or maybe there’s a chance he didn’t drown.—What do you think, sailors?	modern
Good fool, for my brother’s death.	shakespearean
You’ll get a bigger reward than you ever got delivering a letter before.	modern
It’s about you.	modern
Call in my gentlewoman.	shakespearean
Lie thou there (throwing down a letter), for here comes the trout that must be caught with tickling.	shakespearean
I’m the man she wants.	modern
On a moderate pace I have since arrived but hither.	shakespearean
She loves me, sure!	shakespearean
Sweet lady, ho, ho.	shakespearean
He’s as	modern
Damn that dirty black coalminer of a devil!	modern
He insisted on leaving this ring with me whether I wanted it or not.	modern
Don’t be afraid of greatness.” That was well written.	modern
My niece already thinks he’s insane.	modern
If this letter falls into your hands, think carefully about what it says.	modern
And what’s her history?	shakespearean
No, I’d rather you stayed here.	modern
I think I saw you there, you wise man.	modern
Remember who commended thy yellow stockings—” Thy yellow stockings?	shakespearean
How are you, sir?	modern
I can’t love him.	modern
Let’s dance to “You Jerk.” You mean, “Shut up, you jerk”?	modern
The fool’s a good actor.	modern
Truly, madam, he holds Beelzebub at the staves' end as well as a man in his case may do.	shakespearean
If it be so, as ’tis, Poor lady, she were better love a dream.	shakespearean
Why do you speak to me?	shakespearean
Put up your sword.	shakespearean
Jove bless thee, master Parson.	shakespearean
There lies your way, due west.	shakespearean
I told you, someone’s at the gate.	modern
Get to the point now.	modern
The triplex, sir, is a good tripping measure, or the bells of Saint Bennet, sir, may put you in mind—one, two, three.	shakespearean
I think you’re right, sir.	modern
How did you divide yourself in two?	modern
Sir Toby will be sworn that I am no fox, but he will not pass his word for two pence that you are no fool.	shakespearean
I wish this trick would be over.	modern
What do you think of his belief?	modern
Is it possible?	modern
Come, throw it o'er my face.	shakespearean
I’ve heard of men who pick fights with other people on purpose, just to see how brave they are.	modern
What’s she?	shakespearean
Bring us some wine!	modern
How are you feeling, Malvolio?	modern
Come on, Sir Andrew.	modern
What might you think?	shakespearean
Fair lady, do you think you have fools in hand?	shakespearean
It doesn’t matter that I hit him first.	modern
You’re wrong, sir, I do care about something.	modern
Good gentle one, give me modest assurance if you be the lady of the house, that I may proceed in my speech.	shakespearean
My kind Antonio, I can no other answer make but thanks, And thanks, and ever thanks.	shakespearean
Besides, she treats me more respectfully than the other servants.	modern
Oh, he’s drunk, Sir Toby, for a whole hour now.	modern
If you offend him, I for him defy you.	shakespearean
Go shake your ears!	shakespearean
But died thy sister of her love, my boy?	shakespearean
Let our catch be “Thou Knave.” “Hold thy peace, thou knave,” knight?	shakespearean
Art not thou the Lady Olivia’s fool?	shakespearean
By God, I’ll go after him again and beat him up.	modern
Run after that same peevish messenger, The county’s man.	shakespearean
I did, Malvolio?	modern
Your lord does know my mind.	shakespearean
What kind of woman is she?	modern
I may command the one I love.” Well, she commands me.	modern
So I do, madonna.	shakespearean
Who did this, Sir Andrew?	modern
O, welcome, father!	shakespearean
Nay, but say true, does it work upon him?	shakespearean
Observe him, for the love of mockery, for I know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of him.	shakespearean
Alas, their love may be called appetite, No motion of the liver, but the palate, That suffer surfeit, cloyment, and revolt; But mine is all as hungry as the sea, And can digest as much.	shakespearean
What’s his name?	modern
Get out of my sight!—Dear Cesario, please don’t be offended.—Get out of here, you barbarian!	modern
You’re so attractive when you smile.	modern
Sir Toby, I’ve got to be frank with you.	modern
If my lady have not called up her steward Malvolio and bid him turn you out of doors, never trust me.	shakespearean
Take the fool away.	shakespearean
Prove true, imagination, oh, prove true, That I, dear brother, be now ta'en for you!	shakespearean
I dare lay any money ’twill be nothing yet.	shakespearean
Well, God is responsible for that, not me, and he deserves thanks.	modern
O, you give me ill counsel.	shakespearean
Here comes Sir Toby, limping.	modern
Who tricked you?	modern
Should I blab to her that you’re coming?	modern
The whole quarrel might have been resolved since then when we repaid what we stole from them—which most of our city did, for the sake of friendly trade relations.	modern
I won’t mess with him.	modern
My words are as full of peace as matter.	shakespearean
No, sooth, sir.	shakespearean
I’m better off because of my enemies, and worse off because of my friends.	modern
Has your lord given you any orders to negotiate with my face?	modern
By my troth, I would not undertake her in this company.	shakespearean
Bonos dies, Sir Toby.	shakespearean
Now heaven walks on earth.	shakespearean
Haven’t you, boy?	modern
His breath stinks.	modern
Here comes the little villain.	shakespearean
A woman should always pick an older man.	modern
That’s a nice hand you dealt me.	modern
Why, “some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrown upon them.” I was one, sir, in this interlude, one Sir Topas, sir, but that’s all one.	shakespearean
Marry, now I let go your hand, I am barren.	shakespearean
Is ’t not well done?	shakespearean
That means it’s more likely to be fake.	modern
I saw ’t i' the orchard.	shakespearean
If you’re the lady of the house, then it’s true you’re stealing your role, because what’s yours to give away is not yours to keep for yourself.	modern
Oh, Lord!	modern
Who’s she?	modern
I call thee by the most modest terms, for I am one of those gentle ones that will use the devil himself with courtesy.	shakespearean
Slight, will you make an ass o' me?	shakespearean
So let me hear what you have to say.	modern
I don’t know what I’m doing.	modern
These crisscrossing laces do cut off the circulation in my legs a bit, but who cares?	modern
What’s to do?	shakespearean
You’re overstepping your bounds now.	modern
But if she can’t love you, sir?	modern
Let me speak a little.	shakespearean
I think not so, my lord.	shakespearean
Get him to bed and make sure his wounds are treated.	modern
I swear, this fool has an excellent singing voice.	modern
Or I’ll deliver thy indignation to him by word of mouth.	shakespearean
Oh, I remember that very clearly!	modern
Is it that aggressive?	modern
I’ve heard my father mention him.	modern
I’m sorry, but I memorized what I’m supposed to say here today, and that question isn’t part of the speech I learned.	modern
Refuse it not.	shakespearean
Let him let the matter slip, and I’ll give him my horse, gray Capilet.	shakespearean
Who did this to him?	modern
Therefore get you on and give him his desire.	shakespearean
An your ladyship will have it as it ought to be, you must allow  Prithee, read i' thy right wits.	shakespearean
They lack retention.	shakespearean
I cannot be so answer’d.	shakespearean
Come on, sir, please.	modern
Oh, Antonio, I’m sorry I caused you so much trouble.	modern
Hello, sir.	modern
Thou canst not choose but know who I am.	shakespearean
Can someone fall in love this quickly?	modern
I couldn’t stay behind after you left.	modern
If this were a play, I’d complain it was unrealistic.	modern
Please let me prove you’re a fool.	modern
Good Mistress Accost, I desire better acquaintance.	shakespearean
I' faith, or I either?	shakespearean
How could I honorably give him what I’ve already given you?	modern
Hold, there’s half my coffer.	shakespearean
I’m no more insane than you are, and I’ll prove it.	modern
I have ’t in my nose too.	shakespearean
Pursue him and entreat him to a peace.	shakespearean
Listen, if you want a good laugh—and I mean a side-splitting one—then follow me.	modern
That’s definitely too old.	modern
My lady would not lose him for more than I’ll say.	shakespearean
You mistake, sir.	shakespearean
The police are here.	modern
None can be called deformed but the unkind.	shakespearean
This may end without anyone getting killed.	modern
Virtue is beauty, but someone beautiful and wicked is like an empty box decorated by the devil.	modern
Yes, nightingales answer daws!	shakespearean
Who are you?	modern
But don’t be afraid, Cesario.	modern
He’s been over there practicing how to act for the past half hour.	modern
Do you come near me now?	shakespearean
There’s another.	shakespearean
If a bloody head counts as a hurt, then you hurt me.	modern
M”—why, that’s the first letter in my name.	modern
This letter’s going to turn him into a starry-eyed idiot.	modern
Ay, ’tis strong, and it does indifferent well in a dun-colored stock.	shakespearean
It’s pretty well done, isn’t it?	modern
Faith, I’ll home tomorrow, Sir Toby.	shakespearean
For women are as roses, whose fair flower Being once displayed, doth fall that very hour.	shakespearean
He’s a good-looking young man, and there are a lot of people with him.	modern
I give you my obedience and my humble service, madam.	modern
My master, not myself, lacks recompense.	shakespearean
She’s been drowned in salty sea water, and now my salty tears are about to drown her memory all over again.	modern
That’s not holy, it’s heresy.	modern
The gentleman insists on fighting a round with you, for the sake of his honor.	modern
My lady Olivia, your niece, disapproves of your late-night partying.	modern
For someone as intelligent as you the situation must be clear enough.	modern
But that it would be double-dealing, sir, I would you could make it another.	shakespearean
This is as rude as it is strange.	modern
And so they are.	shakespearean
The man’s going crazy.	modern
Why, would that have fixed my hair?	modern
From that cabin I’d call out to my soul.	modern
My girlfriend has beautiful white hands, and great warriors aren’t  Ha, ha!	modern
I’m coming, don’t worry.	modern
I will.	modern
I’ll get back at him another way.	modern
