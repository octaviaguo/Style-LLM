I won’t tolerate him.	modern
That’s foolish.	modern
Sole monarch of the universal earth, Oh, what a beast was I to chide at him!	shakespearean
This dagger hath mista'en—for, lo, his house Is empty on the back of Montague, And it mis-sheathèd in my daughter’s bosom.	shakespearean
O most wicked fiend!	shakespearean
We’re ruined, lady, we’re ruined!	modern
Am I really like one of those guys?	modern
I beseech thee, youth, Put not another sin upon my head By urging me to fury.	shakespearean
Tis not to me she speaks.	shakespearean
It’s almost morning.	modern
One kiss, and I’ll descend.	shakespearean
It’s torture, not mercy.	modern
Peter, stay at the gate.	shakespearean
Susan and she—God rest all Christian souls!— Were of an age.	shakespearean
Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands.	shakespearean
I’ll have this knot knit up tomorrow morning.	shakespearean
No matter.	shakespearean
He’s not your man.	modern
Let the blood rushing to my cheeks be calmed.	modern
Leave me alone.	modern
That ever I should live to see thee dead.	shakespearean
Open the tomb.	shakespearean
Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me quivers.	shakespearean
Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.	shakespearean
Stop crying.	modern
What, are you busy?	modern
An he speak any thing against me, I’ll take him down, an he were lustier than he is, and twenty such Jacks.	shakespearean
My invocation Is fair and honest.	shakespearean
Is it young Romeo?	modern
There was no need to tell me to get out of there.	modern
She’s ready to go, but she’ll never return.	modern
But whatever misfortunes occur, they can’t ruin the joy I feel with one look at her.	modern
What do you want from me?	modern
Pitiful sight!	shakespearean
Come forth, thou fearful man.	shakespearean
Within the infant rind of this small flower Poison hath residence and medicine power.	shakespearean
Younger than she are happy mothers made.	shakespearean
Alas, poor Romeo!	shakespearean
One knocks.	shakespearean
Now, by my maidenhead at twelve year old I bade her come.	shakespearean
And it’s good to have joy in such a joyless time.	modern
Romeo, are you going to your father’s for lunch?	modern
I can only repeat what I’ve said before.	modern
I do remember well where I should be, And there I am.	shakespearean
Away with the joint-stools, remove the court-cupboard, look to the plate.	shakespearean
Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead, And Paris too.	shakespearean
Go ask his name.—If he be married.	shakespearean
Let me be satisfied.	shakespearean
Will you tell me that?	shakespearean
Then she is well, and nothing is wrong.	modern
How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath?	shakespearean
You haven’t been conquered.	modern
Leaving you is a thousand times worse than being near you.	modern
Tell me, good my friend, What torch is yond that vainly lends his light To grubs and eyeless skulls?	shakespearean
You are looked for and called for, asked for and sought for, in the great chamber.	shakespearean
I thought all for the best.	shakespearean
Can I go away while my heart stays here?	modern
I’ll be a harsh master to them.	modern
Well, well, you have a careful father, child.	modern
A jealous hood, a jealous hood!	shakespearean
As I slept under this yew-tree here, I had a dream that my master and someone else were fighting and that my master killed him.	modern
Won’t he?	modern
Dinner is over, and we’re going to get there too late.	modern
Farewell, dear Father.	shakespearean
I sink under the heavy weight of love.	modern
Tell me, how did you get in here?	modern
And yet I wish but for the thing I have.	shakespearean
Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.	shakespearean
That villain cousin would have killed my husband.	shakespearean
He is wise, And, on my life, hath stol'n him home to bed.	shakespearean
My sweet, so do I.	modern
Was ever book containing such vile matter So fairly bound?	shakespearean
Do you not see that I am out of breath?	shakespearean
Give me your hand.	modern
From now on, take care of your messages yourself.	modern
We found him in the churchyard.	modern
Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady.—Lord, Lord!	shakespearean
Send thy man away.	shakespearean
Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear, So soon forsaken?	shakespearean
Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.	shakespearean
And now you’ve changed?	modern
My lord, I wish Thursday were tomorrow.	modern
My lord and you were then at Mantua.— Nay, I do bear a brain.—But, as I said, When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool, To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!	shakespearean
No, good goose, don’t bite me.	modern
You mean I should groan and tell you?	modern
Hence, and stand aloof.	shakespearean
Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady.	modern
I wish night would come, like a widow dressed in black, so I can learn how to submit to my husband and lose my virginity.	modern
I saw her laid low in her kindred’s vault And presently took post to tell it you.	shakespearean
The other girl did not love me.	modern
We won’t take their garbage.	modern
Be brisk 0awhile, and the longer liver take all.	shakespearean
Why, what’s Tybalt’s story?	modern
But sadly, tell me who.	shakespearean
I headed toward him, but he saw me coming and hid in the woods.	modern
There stays a husband to make you a wife.	shakespearean
Alack the day.	shakespearean
Was there ever such an evil book with such a beautiful cover?	modern
For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.	shakespearean
Can you not stay awhile?	shakespearean
Our love, which right now is like a flower bud in the summer air, may turn out to be a beautiful flower by the next time we meet.	modern
I will then give it you soundly.	shakespearean
You’re this poor and wretched and still afraid to die?	modern
Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy Be heaped like mine, and that thy skill be more To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath This neighbor air, and let rich music’s tongue Unfold the imagined happiness that both Receive in either by this dear encounter.	shakespearean
I’ve been hurt.	modern
Oh, noble prince, I can tell you everything about the unfortunate circumstances of this deadly fight.	modern
I met the youthful lord at Lawrence' cell, And gave him what becomèd love I might, Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty.	shakespearean
A jumbled confession can only receive a jumbled absolution.	modern
Good man, why are you crying?	modern
Yea,” quoth he, “Dost thou fall upon thy face?	shakespearean
Come break this up, Benvolio.	modern
Mercutio, be quiet.	modern
There is time enough.	shakespearean
Answer that question.	modern
Not to his father’s.	shakespearean
What, you don’t say a word?	modern
Ha, ha.	shakespearean
Yet I will adventure.	shakespearean
Your plantain leaf is excellent for that.	shakespearean
Or else love is blind, and its best time is the night.	modern
Call, good Mercutio.	shakespearean
Commend me to your daughter.	shakespearean
And all the better is it for the maid.	shakespearean
If her eyes were in the night sky, they would shine so brightly through space that birds would start singing, thinking her light was the light of day.	modern
Yes, that’s true.	modern
The groans you used to make are still ringing in my old ears.	modern
Is that the rope ladder Romeo told you to pick up?	modern
Therefore we’ll have about half a dozen friends to the wedding, and that’s it.	modern
You disgust me, you little bug!	modern
Who calls so loud?	shakespearean
Virtue turns to vice if it’s misused.	modern
What will we say is our excuse for being here?	modern
Everyone prepare to take this beautiful corpse to her grave.	modern
Now God in heaven bless thee!	shakespearean
What do you want?	modern
This is the most miserable hour of all time!	modern
The sun itself has never seen anyone as beautiful since the world began.	modern
If you act like my daughter, I’ll marry you to my friend.	modern
I know not, sir.	shakespearean
A cup, closed in my true love’s hand?	shakespearean
It is some meteor that the sun exhales To be to thee this night a torchbearer, And light thee on thy way to Mantua.	shakespearean
Now you know the reason for the rush.	modern
Oh, I wish I was the glove on that hand so that I could touch that cheek.	modern
Well, we were born to die.	shakespearean
How fares my Juliet?	shakespearean
I am content, so thou wilt have it so.	shakespearean
What’s this?	shakespearean
And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig’s tail Tickling a parson’s nose as he lies asleep, Then he dreams of another benefice.	shakespearean
I want to take the love I had for my cousin and take it out on the body of the man who killed him.	modern
The sound of lovers calling each others names through the night is silver-sweet.	modern
I must hide in the darkness for awhile.	modern
You’re    Pull out your tool now.	modern
Thus then in brief: The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.	shakespearean
Oh God!—Oh Nurse, how can this be stopped?	modern
Their course of love, the tidings of her death.	shakespearean
But I would kill you by petting you too much.	modern
Give me, give me!	shakespearean
Only you would look for a fight like that.	modern
But new struck nine.	shakespearean
Oh, pardon me for bringing this bad news, but you told me it was my job, sir.	modern
But to say that Tybalt’s dead and then say, “Romeo has been banished.” To say that is like saying that my father, my mother, Tybalt, Romeo, and Juliet have all been killed, they’re all dead.	modern
Now must I to the monument alone.	shakespearean
Therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not with me.	shakespearean
If they do see thee they will murder thee.	shakespearean
I am none of his skains-mates.	shakespearean
Speak not.	shakespearean
Hit them!	modern
Stay the friar too.	shakespearean
Darkness is stumbling out of the sun’s path like a drunk man.	modern
Now do you know the reason of this haste.	shakespearean
Do you love me?	modern
The law that threatened death becomes thy friend And turns it to exile—there art thou happy.	shakespearean
Come, we burn daylight, ho!	shakespearean
Do you need my help?	modern
My wits faints.	shakespearean
Tonight she is mewed up to her heaviness.	shakespearean
You won’t stand and fight.	modern
Cry but “Ay me!” Pronounce but “love” and “dove.” Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word, One nickname for her purblind son and heir, Young Abraham Cupid, he that shot so true When King Cophetua loved the beggar maid.— He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not.	shakespearean
But one, poor one, one poor and loving child, But one thing to rejoice and solace in, And cruel death hath catched it from my sight!	shakespearean
There, where the torch is burning.	modern
Why, how now, Juliet?	shakespearean
Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be moved.	shakespearean
But here come some people, right in the nick of time.	modern
Hie to high fortune!	shakespearean
Nurse, will you come with me to my closet and help me pick out the clothes and the jewelry I’ll need to wear tomorrow?	modern
Courage, man.	shakespearean
No, noble Romeo, you’ve got to dance.	modern
You have dancing shoes With nimble soles.	shakespearean
My dearest cousin and my dearer lord?	shakespearean
Here were the servants of your adversary, And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.	shakespearean
Live, and hereafter say A madman’s mercy bid thee run away.	shakespearean
I know thou wilt say “ay,” And I will take thy word.	shakespearean
The ground is bloody.—Search about the churchyard.	shakespearean
I ask that again because nothing can be wrong if she is well.	modern
As I did sleep under this yew tree here, I dreamt my master and another fought, And that my master slew him.	shakespearean
If everything else fails, at least I have the power to take my own life.	modern
What a pestilent knave is this same!	shakespearean
You are a lover.	shakespearean
This fight will decide who dies.	modern
Why, may I ask?	modern
I don’t want to dance.	modern
May not one speak?	shakespearean
Arms, make your last embrace!	modern
Oh, sad day!	modern
Love give me strength, and strength shall help afford.	shakespearean
What satisfaction could you possibly have tonight?	modern
Even so lies she, Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.	shakespearean
Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.	shakespearean
Here’s such a coil.	shakespearean
He’s hiding out in Friar Lawrence’s cell.	modern
She will indite him to some supper.	shakespearean
I’ll bring you there.	modern
I’ll tell you more later about when and where we met, how we fell in love, and how we exchanged promises, but now I’m begging you: please, agree to marry us today.	modern
Before I could break up the fight, Tybalt was killed.	modern
You’re making such a fuss.	modern
He ran this way and jumped over this orchard wall.	modern
Please tell me.	modern
What do you have to say, my dear Nurse?	modern
Go thy ways, wench.	shakespearean
Good morning to you both.	modern
Tell us what you know about this affair.	modern
Get me some ink and paper, and hire some horses to ride.	modern
By my count, I was your mother much upon these years That you are now a maid.	shakespearean
Come hither, man.	shakespearean
What cursèd foot wanders this way tonight To cross my obsequies and true love’s rite?	shakespearean
I’ll pretend to be the housewife for once.	modern
Hold on, then.	modern
Ah, Juliet if you’re as happy as I am, and you’re better with words, tell me about the happiness you imagine we’ll have in our marriage.	modern
Oh, poor Romeo!	modern
Come here, man.	modern
Here comes my man, the man I’m looking for.	modern
Then have at thee, boy!	shakespearean
Everyone says you can’t make up your mind.	modern
The wind you’re talking about is blowing us off our course.	modern
An I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish.	shakespearean
Give me my fan, Peter.	modern
Why, I am glad on ’t.	shakespearean
Let’s see how.	modern
Tell me, my daughter Juliet, what is your attitude about getting married?	modern
Tis late.	shakespearean
So to be banished from Verona is like being banished from the world, and being banished from the world is death.	modern
Commend me to thy lady.	shakespearean
O, tell me, Friar, tell me, In what vile part of this anatomy Doth my name lodge?	shakespearean
And what about that?	modern
The man who killed Mercutio, which way did he go?	modern
Have I thought long to see this morning’s face, And doth it give me such a sight as this?	shakespearean
I won’t fail.	modern
Signor Martino and his wife and daughters, Count Anselme and his beautiful sisters, Vitruvio’s widow, Signor Placentio and his lovely nieces, Mercutio and his brother Valentine, My uncle Capulet and his wife and daughters, My fair niece Rosaline and Livia,	modern
Whichever of you acts shy, I’ll swear she has corns.	modern
Faith, we may put up our pipes and be gone.	shakespearean
What is yond gentleman?	shakespearean
Oh nature, what were you doing in hell?	modern
You know too much about suffering.	modern
I hope you’re lucky enough to hear the true story by sticking around.	modern
Take no note of him.	shakespearean
Was that my father that went hence so fast?	shakespearean
What have you found out?	modern
If any of my relatives find you here they’ll kill you because of who you are.	modern
Ready to go, but never to return.	shakespearean
Marry, I remember it well.	shakespearean
O heavy day!	shakespearean
Yes, let the count take you in your bed.	modern
I am sped.	shakespearean
Your Juliet is alive.	modern
Come, vial.	shakespearean
How, will she none?	shakespearean
I’ll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.	shakespearean
O God, she comes.—O honey Nurse, what news?	shakespearean
That’s not so.	shakespearean
My noble uncle, do you know why he acts this way?	modern
She speaks, yet she says nothing.	shakespearean
That “banishèd,” that one word “banishèd” Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts.	shakespearean
It’s a sweet lozenge that you choke on.	modern
Friends, part!” and, swifter than his tongue, His agile arm beats down their fatal points, And ’twixt them rushes—underneath whose arm An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled.	shakespearean
Is your man secret?	shakespearean
Oh, where’s Romeo?	modern
This is good.	modern
Let him alone.	shakespearean
Put up thy sword, Or manage it to part these men with me.	shakespearean
Haven’t you ever heard the saying, “Two can conspire to put one away”?	modern
You have to contradict me, do you?	modern
What strange reason could she have for coming here?	modern
Educated men are so impressive!	modern
Hie you to the cell.	shakespearean
What said my man, when my betossèd soul Did not attend him as we rode?	shakespearean
Have you killed Tybalt?	modern
He’s dead.	modern
Nay, as they dare.	shakespearean
Yes, yes, this is the rope ladder.	modern
I think he told me Paris was about to marry Juliet.	modern
The wound can’t be that bad.	modern
Oh, good, a knife!	modern
Who is ’t that calls?	shakespearean
I see.	modern
What I’m saying can’t anger him.	modern
You would fight with a man if he had one more whisker or one less whisker in his beard than you have in your beard.	modern
A thousand times the worse to want thy light.	shakespearean
Now he’s ready for	modern
I speak no treason.	shakespearean
I’m in a rush.	modern
Oh my, my bones ache so much.	modern
Life and these lips have long been separated.	shakespearean
That shall she.	shakespearean
Nay, he will answer the letter’s master, how he dares, being dared.	shakespearean
Calling death “banishment,” Thou cutt’st my head off with a golden ax And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.	shakespearean
My master is the great rich Capulet, and if you be not of the house of Montagues, I pray come and crush a cup of wine.	shakespearean
Wilt thou not, Jule?” It stinted and said “ay.” And stint thou too, I pray thee, Nurse, say I.	shakespearean
O Juliet, I already know thy grief.	shakespearean
Th' exchange of thy love’s faithful vow for mine.	shakespearean
But now I’ll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.	shakespearean
Not a dump, we.	shakespearean
I’ll answer for you.	modern
Shame on Romeo!	modern
Good thou, save me a piece of marchpane, and, as thou loves me, let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.—Antony and Potpan!	shakespearean
But I’ll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery.	shakespearean
They’ll be in scarlet straight at any news.	shakespearean
Cruel, cruel Death killed her.	modern
O God, I have an ill-divining soul.	shakespearean
But like I said, when she tasted the bitter wormwood on my nipple, the pretty little babe got irritated and started to quarrel with my breast.	modern
How can you be out of breath when you have enough breath to tell me that you’re out of breath?	modern
You won’t, then?	modern
Now I’ll tell you so you don’t have to ask.	modern
The beautiful Rosaline whom you love so much will be at Capulet’s traditional feast, along with every beautiful woman in Verona.	modern
I’m not one of his sluts.	modern
Be quick for a while and let the one who lives the longest take everything.	modern
Let me talk to you about your situation.	modern
All this is comforting news.	modern
Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake.	shakespearean
The other did not so.	shakespearean
You take your beauty sleep now.	modern
God’s bread!	shakespearean
Alack the day!	shakespearean
Not proud you have, but thankful that you have.	shakespearean
O God!—O Nurse, how shall this be prevented?	shakespearean
Nay, I’ll conjure too!	shakespearean
Hold, there is forty ducats.	shakespearean
Here, here will I remain With worms that are thy chamber maids.	shakespearean
I’m suddenly afraid.	modern
For Juliet’s sake, for her sake, rise and stand up.	modern
I have it, And soundly too.	shakespearean
Oh, deadly sin!	modern
What if this mixture do not work at all?	shakespearean
Grief of my son’s exile hath stopped her breath.	shakespearean
What of that?	shakespearean
Uncle, this man is a Montague—our enemy.	modern
How long hath he been there?	shakespearean
Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.	shakespearean
That rotten scoundrel!	modern
My master is the great and rich Capulet, and if you don’t belong to the house of Montague, please come and drink a cup of wine.	modern
You’re a lover.	modern
Too familiar Is my dear son with such sour company.	shakespearean
Do you think it’s a good idea to rush?	modern
What, ho?	shakespearean
If you were ever yourself, and this sadness was yours, you and your sadness were all for Rosaline.	modern
O woeful time.	shakespearean
But passion lends them power, time means, to meet, Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.	shakespearean
The woman I love is beautiful.	modern
Romeo must not live.	shakespearean
And stay, good Nurse.	shakespearean
Let them begin.	shakespearean
Doesn’t she realize how unworthy she is of the gentleman we have found to be her bridegroom?	modern
If they see you, they’ll murder you.	modern
I’ve stayed up all night many times before for less important matters, and I’ve never gotten sick.	modern
Come out, you frightened man.	modern
But where unbruisèd youth with unstuffed brain Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign.	shakespearean
He is not the flower of courtesy, but, I’ll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb.	shakespearean
They’re looking for you in the great chamber.	modern
She’s dead, like a beautiful flower, killed by an unseasonable frost.	modern
Well then, saint, let lips do what hands do.	modern
Thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarreling.	shakespearean
May God choose you to receive his grace.	modern
Listen, because Tybalt was just killed, people might think that we don’t care about his memory as our relative if we have too grand a party.	modern
I’m biting my thumb.	modern
Fear comes upon me.	shakespearean
A woman more beautiful than the one I love?	modern
Dear love, adieu.— Anon, good Nurse!—Sweet Montague, be true.	shakespearean
Climb up to her bedroom and comfort her.	modern
I will show myself a tyrant.	shakespearean
Which way ran he that killed Mercutio?	shakespearean
I wot well where he is.	shakespearean
With another, for tying his new shoes with old ribbon?	shakespearean
A man, young lady!	shakespearean
Hurry up, it’s getting late.	modern
I have watched ere now All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.	shakespearean
Please, tell my father, madam, I won’t marry yet.	modern
Don’t stay here, go away.	modern
God bless you!	modern
There’s a husband there who’s waiting to make you his wife.	modern
And, pretty fool, it stinted and said “ay.” Enough of this.	shakespearean
Who’s that calling so loud?	modern
Art thou a man?	shakespearean
Tell me, my good friend, what is that light over there?	modern
Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change, Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse, And all things change them to the contrary.	shakespearean
And trust me, love, you look pale to me too.	modern
But it’s enough.	modern
You foolish madman, listen to me for a moment.	modern
The curfew-bell rang.	modern
What an annoying man, this guy is!	modern
Find them out whose names are written here?	shakespearean
Forget about him, Jack!	modern
We found him in the churchyard.	shakespearean
Tybalt would kill thee, But thou slew’st Tybalt—there art thou happy.	shakespearean
I know you’ll say “yes,” and I’ll believe you.	modern
Trust to ’t, bethink you.	shakespearean
She was tricked, divorced, wronged, spited, killed!	modern
We’ll have the wedding at the church tomorrow.	modern
Be quiet, you mumbling fool!	modern
I’m at your service.	modern
Tonight she is shut up in her room, alone with her sadness.	modern
And badest me bury love.	shakespearean
We’re unprepared for this wedding celebration.	modern
Let them affright thee.	shakespearean
Noble Mercutio, put your sword away.	modern
I protest unto thee— Good heart, and i' faith, I will tell her as much.	shakespearean
Why, uncle, ’tis a shame.	shakespearean
Her blood has stopped, and her joints are stiff.	modern
I’m a friend, a friend who knows you well.	modern
There’s two—a man and a woman.	modern
Let not the Nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.	shakespearean
Will you go to them?	shakespearean
Do you hear me?	modern
Cast it off!	shakespearean
Here’s one, a friend, and one that knows you well.	shakespearean
Now Romeo is beloved and loves again, Alike bewitchèd by the charm of looks, But to his foe supposed he must complain, And she steal love’s sweet bait from fearful hooks.	shakespearean
Sin from thy lips?	shakespearean
O Lord, I could have stayed here all the night To hear good counsel.	shakespearean
Thou hast quarreled with a man for coughing in the street because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun.	shakespearean
What man art thou that, thus bescreened in night, So stumblest on my counsel?	shakespearean
Now my sin has been taken from my lips by yours.	modern
Go away and stay apart from me.	modern
I’ll look to like if looking liking move.	shakespearean
Be merciful and say “death.” Exile is much worse than death.	modern
I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it, On Thursday next be married to this county.	shakespearean
The Earth is nature’s mother and also nature’s tomb.	modern
Gregory, remember how to slash.	modern
Now you’re Romeo.	modern
Well, think of marriage now.	shakespearean
Aren’t you Romeo?	modern
He locks himself up alone in his bedroom, shuts his windows to keep out the beautiful daylight, and makes himself an artificial night.	modern
You, Prince, are the man who can give me justice.	modern
If you’re a member of a divine spiritual order of men who forgive sins, and you say you’re my friend, how do you have the heart to mangle me with the word banishment?	modern
Now, good sweet Nurse—Oh Lord, why do you look so sad?	modern
But all this did I know before.	shakespearean
I will omit no opportunity That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.	shakespearean
O simple!	shakespearean
Take a little vacation in Mantua.	modern
Two of the brightest stars in the whole sky had to go away on business, and they’re asking her eyes to twinkle in their places until they return.	modern
Wisely and slow.	shakespearean
Give me one kiss, and I’ll go down.	modern
I would not for the wealth of all the town Here in my house do him disparagement.	shakespearean
O Friar, the damnèd use that word in hell.	shakespearean
Come along with me.	modern
They’ve turned me into food for worms.	modern
Her lord is come.	shakespearean
Can’t I say something?	modern
That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.	shakespearean
Those who rush stumble and fall.	modern
Let them put fear in your heart.	modern
I’m smart enough to find the logs myself without bothering Peter.	modern
Have a nice day!	modern
Good Father, I beseech you on my knees, Hear me with patience but to speak a word.	shakespearean
Well, thou hast comforted me marvelous much.	shakespearean
That’s three hours since nine o'clock, but she hasn’t come back.	modern
There, where the torch doth burn.	shakespearean
Then move not, while my prayer’s effect I take.	shakespearean
Sweet, so would I.	shakespearean
You were never with me for anything if you weren’t there for the goose.	modern
Another studpid answer!	modern
Holy Saint Francis, this is a drastic change!	modern
Have courage, man.	modern
Two unlucky children of these enemy families become lovers and commit suicide.	modern
The cords That Romeo bid thee fetch?	shakespearean
Lady, come out of the tomb.	modern
Come, Romeo.	modern
He’s been seen there many mornings, crying tears that add drops to the morning dew and making a cloudy day cloudier with his sighs.	modern
Live, and from now on, say a madman mercifully told you to run away.	modern
A pack of blessings light upon thy back, Happiness courts thee in her best array,	shakespearean
Let me be captured.	modern
Well, girl, thou weep’st not so much for his death, As that the villain lives which slaughtered him.	shakespearean
Madam, if you could find out but a man To bear a poison, I would temper it, That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof, Soon sleep in quiet.	shakespearean
Death lies on her like an untimely frost Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.	shakespearean
Ye say honestly.	shakespearean
Men’s eyes were made to look and let them gaze.	shakespearean
Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?	shakespearean
Ay, if I know the letters and the language.	shakespearean
Sweet Montague, be true.	modern
I’ll come back.	modern
Flies may do this, but I from this must fly.	shakespearean
Is it really true?	modern
This is well.	shakespearean
Then repeat this after me: you can’t expect women to be faithful when men are so unreliable.	modern
His son is elder, sir.	shakespearean
Let me keep weeping for such a great loss.	modern
You pale face!	modern
Romeo, away, be gone!	shakespearean
Oh no!	modern
O woeful, woeful, woeful day!	shakespearean
Can I go forward when my heart is here?	shakespearean
Calm down, gentle cousin.	modern
Romeo slew Tybalt.	shakespearean
That dirty rat!	modern
You don’t know how to pick a man.	modern
Beguiled, divorcèd, wrongèd, spited, slain!	shakespearean
Excuse me, sir, do you know how to read?	modern
My lord, you’re wrong to berate her like that.	modern
O blessèd, blessèd night!	shakespearean
Dove-feathered raven, wolvish-ravening lamb!	shakespearean
I will not budge for no man’s pleasure, I.	shakespearean
Today’s a holiday, so the beggar’s shop is shut.	modern
Her eye discourses.	shakespearean
O deadly sin!	shakespearean
And what says My concealed lady to our canceled love?	shakespearean
Some others search.	shakespearean
Go to your bedroom.	modern
Alright, I will.	modern
Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.	shakespearean
I’m not one of his punk friends who carries a knife.	modern
Even if the news is sad, tell me with a smile on your face.	modern
O, be gone!	shakespearean
Isn’t she proud of such a match?	modern
Oh, she shows the torches how to burn bright!	modern
Please grant my prayer so my faith doesn’t turn to despair.	modern
Come on, we’re wasting precious daylight.	modern
It is my lady.	shakespearean
My master’s house.	modern
For naught so vile that on the earth doth live But to the earth some special good doth give.	shakespearean
Wouldst thou withdraw it?	shakespearean
He’ll fright you up, i' faith.	shakespearean
You should be able to endure this because the world is broad and wide.	modern
Curse the day!	modern
We’ll follow you.	modern
But what say you to Thursday?	shakespearean
Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly, And so did I.	shakespearean
Is the day so young?	shakespearean
Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither.	shakespearean
I bet she’s fast asleep.	modern
My dismal scene I needs must act alone.	shakespearean
Go, then, for ’tis in vain To seek him here that means not to be found.	shakespearean
What else is love?	modern
Hold, take these keys, and fetch more spices, Nurse.	shakespearean
Oh, that’s a joke made out of leather that spreads itself thin, from the width of an inch to as fat as a yard.	modern
Good afternoon, fair lady.	modern
You have amazed me.	modern
The Prince will doom thee death If thou art taken.	shakespearean
Go, get out of here.	modern
Three words, dear Romeo, and then it’s good night for real.	modern
Of love?	shakespearean
Scurvy knave!	shakespearean
Who greets me so early in the morning?	modern
Wait, Tybalt, wait!	modern
What, art thou hurt?	shakespearean
Rust inside my body and let me die.	modern
Romeo will thank you, my girl, for both of us.	modern
My life were better ended by their hate Than death proroguèd, wanting of thy love.	shakespearean
My employer is as good as yours.	modern
Thou know’st my lodging.	shakespearean
On, lusty gentlemen.	shakespearean
Only to be generous and give it to you once more.	modern
Romeo is hateful, even though God isn’t.	modern
Where shall we dine?—O me!	shakespearean
You will also confess, I’m sure, that you love me.	modern
Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship And needly will be ranked with other griefs, Why followed not, when she said “Tybalt’s dead,” “Thy father” or “thy mother,” nay, or both, Which modern lamentations might have moved?	shakespearean
You say well.	shakespearean
Sadness over my son’s exile stopped her breath.	modern
I’ll bury you in a magnificent grave.	modern
Be fickle, fortune, For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long, But send him back.	shakespearean
Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love, And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next— But, soft!	shakespearean
Scurvy knave!	shakespearean
Is it e'en so?	shakespearean
The strangers all are gone.	shakespearean
I’ll bury thee in a triumphant grave.	shakespearean
But I am sent to find those persons whose names are here writ, and can never find what names the writing person hath here writ.	shakespearean
Let me tell you, the man who marries her will become very wealthy.	modern
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill Of this day’s journey, and from nine till twelve Is three long hours, yet she is not come.	shakespearean
The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.	shakespearean
You started a fight with a man who coughed in the street because he woke up a dog that was sleeping in the sun.	modern
Marry, that, I think, be young Petruchio.	shakespearean
Uncomfortable time, why camest thou now To murder, murder our solemnity?	shakespearean
Farewell!—God knows when we shall meet again.	shakespearean
A plague o' both your houses!	shakespearean
Or should we enter without apologizing?	modern
Marry, ’tis enough.	shakespearean
I have.	shakespearean
I’ll bite you on the ear for that joke.	modern
Oh, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.	shakespearean
Out on her, hilding!	shakespearean
Don’t talk back to me.	modern
But saying o'er what I have said before.	shakespearean
Your lady mother is coming to your chamber.	shakespearean
Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?	shakespearean
I’ll give my vile body back to the earth.	modern
God shield I should disturb devotion!— Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye.	shakespearean
Your last guess is right.	modern
I’ll confess to you that I love him.	modern
Tybalt’s death Was woe enough, if it had ended there.	shakespearean
This torture should be roared in dismal hell.	shakespearean
Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier’s nose, And then dreams he of smelling out a suit.	shakespearean
Life, living, all is Death’s.	shakespearean
You could not prevent her from dying someday, but heaven will give her eternal life.	modern
That last is true.	shakespearean
Thy wild acts denote The unreasonable fury of a beast.	shakespearean
I had only one child, one poor child, one poor and loving child, the one thing I had to rejoice and comfort myself, and cruel Death has stolen it from me!	modern
Hurry up, I say.	modern
Old Montague is come, And flourishes his blade in spite of me.	shakespearean
This is she—    Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!	shakespearean
As I discern, It burneth in the Capels' monument.	shakespearean
Oh, I wish I could make a  My soul is calling out my name.	modern
That can’t be.	modern
That villain, Romeo.	modern
I would have made it short, for I was come to the whole depth of my tale, and meant, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer.	shakespearean
That is because the traitor murderer lives.	shakespearean
But old folks, many feign as they were dead, Unwieldy, slow, heavy, and pale as lead.	shakespearean
The slip, sir, the slip.	shakespearean
Oh painful, painful, painful day!	modern
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.	shakespearean
What do you think about Thursday?	modern
Methinks I see thee now, thou art so low As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.	shakespearean
I saw her buried in her family’s tomb, and then I came here to tell you the news.	modern
And we mean well in going to this mask, But ’tis no wit to go.	shakespearean
I’ll call you a minstrel.	modern
Oh, she is lame!	shakespearean
Not I, believe me.	shakespearean
God forbid that I should prevent sacred devotion!	modern
Your love says, like an honorable gentleman, 'Where is your mother?	modern
For shame, bring Juliet forth.	shakespearean
The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears, Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears.	shakespearean
How now, who calls?	shakespearean
Why, lady!	shakespearean
Thou, why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast.	shakespearean
Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender Of my child’s love.	shakespearean
Henceforth I never will be Romeo.	shakespearean
I won’t listen to your pleas or excuses.	modern
But to be frank, and give it thee again.	shakespearean
Were you talking about Juliet?	modern
Where else would she be?	modern
We’ll to dinner, thither.	shakespearean
Hast thou slain Tybalt?	shakespearean
Good morrow to you both.	shakespearean
Don’t “ Yes, Nurse, what about that?	modern
I beseech you, follow straight.	shakespearean
We shouldn’t have too big a celebration—we can invite a friend or two.	modern
Is she not proud?	shakespearean
No, not till Thursday.	shakespearean
If love be rough with you, be rough with love.	shakespearean
I dreamt a dream tonight.	shakespearean
Her eyes are saying something.	modern
Let me see her.	shakespearean
I assure you, my man is as true as steel.	modern
But now I have joyful news for you, girl.	modern
What of that?	shakespearean
Then the window lets day in, and life goes out the window.	modern
Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye, The day to cheer and night’s dank dew to dry, I must upfill this osier cage of ours With baleful weeds and precious-juicèd flowers.	shakespearean
Look how she leans her hand on her cheek.	modern
Good night, good night!	shakespearean
There rust and let me die.	shakespearean
I will die, And leave him all.	shakespearean
Take me inside some house, Benvolio, or I’ll pass out.	modern
It is not yet near day.	shakespearean
Go to bed, dear.	modern
Yes, madam.	shakespearean
Here all eyes gaze on us.	shakespearean
Well, you’re not on target there.	modern
And private in his chamber pens himself, Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out, And makes himself an artificial night.	shakespearean
What kind of man are you?	modern
If my heart’s dear love— Well, do not swear.	shakespearean
Oh, mickle is the powerful grace that lies In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities.	shakespearean
And why, my Lady Wisdom?	shakespearean
The boy is warning me that someone approaches.	modern
Oh, thou art deceived.	shakespearean
Stand not amazed.	shakespearean
No, Romeo will respond to the letter’s writer, telling him whether he accepts the challenge.	modern
Is thy news good, or bad?	shakespearean
You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.	shakespearean
Oh wife, look at how our daughter bleeds!	modern
Why, then, should I cry?	modern
Good Romeo, hide thyself.	shakespearean
Why, may one ask?	shakespearean
In love?	shakespearean
It is a most sharp sauce.	shakespearean
If all else fail, myself have power to die.	shakespearean
How often tonight have my old feet stumbled on gravestones!	modern
Get me ink and paper, And hire post horses.	shakespearean
What, rouse thee, man!	shakespearean
And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!	shakespearean
I’ll go alone.	shakespearean
His arrow has pierced me too deeply, so I can’t fly high with his cheerful feathers.	modern
Hold, then.	shakespearean
Flies are healthier and more honorable and better suited for romance than Romeo.	modern
O, what more favor can I do to thee, Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain To sunder his that was thine enemy?	shakespearean
Farewell, my coz.	shakespearean
My nyas?	shakespearean
No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest.	shakespearean
It’s not the right time to play.	modern
Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.	shakespearean
Where do you come from?	modern
My soul and not my child!	modern
She’s too beautiful and too wise to deserve heaven’s blessing by making me despair.	modern
Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!	shakespearean
How is she doing?	modern
When only one or two men have all the good manners, and even they are dirty, things are bad.	modern
The bridegroom he is come already.	shakespearean
My head is pounding.	modern
But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart.	shakespearean
Welcome, gentlemen.	modern
Me they shall feel while I am able to stand, and ’tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.	shakespearean
It is an honor that I do not dream of.	modern
The ground is bloody.	modern
Will it not be?	shakespearean
Now, fellow, What is there?	shakespearean
Leave me and do the thing I bid thee do.	shakespearean
It’s a cup, closed in my true love’s hand?	modern
Go thither, and with unattainted eye Compare her face with some that I shall show, And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.	shakespearean
So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.	shakespearean
I dare draw as soon as another man if I see occasion in a good quarrel and the law on my side.	shakespearean
What’s the problem, that they cry out so loud?	modern
We don’t need to hear it.	modern
Why dost thou stay?	shakespearean
Where are they supposed to come?	modern
Your love says, like an honest gentleman, 'Where is your mother?	shakespearean
Come on!	modern
Where is my page?	modern
Farewell, farewell!	modern
I’ll come with you.	modern
Are you going?	modern
You should go to Juliet and dress her up.	modern
Either my eyesight fails, or thou look’st pale.	shakespearean
Oh love!	modern
Forget to think of her.	shakespearean
This, by his voice, should be a Montague.—   What, dares the slave Come hither, covered with an antic face, To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?	shakespearean
She’s lying on the ground just like him, blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.	modern
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life, Whose misadventured piteous overthrows Doth with their death bury their parents' strife.	shakespearean
Here are forty ducats.	modern
Alright, let’s fight, boy!	modern
Well, that’s an  Stay, fellow.	modern
What unaccustomed cause procures her hither?	shakespearean
Why rail’st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?	shakespearean
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them, To make me die with a restorative.	shakespearean
What misadventure is so early up That calls our person from our morning rest?	shakespearean
We took this pickax and this shovel from him, as he was walking from this side of the graveyard.	modern
As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast.	shakespearean
I’m only trying to keep the peace.	modern
I will say for you.	shakespearean
I’d bet fourteen of my own teeth—but, I’m sorry to say, I only have four teeth—she’s not fourteen.	modern
I am afeard, Being in night, all this is but a dream, Too flattering sweet to be substantial.	shakespearean
Now get out of here.	modern
Are you trying to wash him out of his grave with tears?	modern
A great suspicion.	shakespearean
The most you hope for was for her to marry wealthy and rise up the social ladder—that was your idea of heaven.	modern
Full half an hour.	shakespearean
Am I like such a fellow?	shakespearean
I drink to thee.	shakespearean
Give me that pickax and the crowbar.	modern
It is written that shoemakers and tailors should play with each others' tools, that fisherman should play with paints, and painters should play with with fishing nets.	modern
You’re not taking one step toward an enemy.	modern
This night I hold an old accustomed feast, Whereto I have invited many a guest Such as I love.	shakespearean
He knows what?	modern
But with a rearward following Tybalt’s death, “Romeo is banishèd.” To speak that word, Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet, All slain, all dead.	shakespearean
Tis now near night.	shakespearean
Don’t disturb the heavens any more by trying to go against heaven’s will.	modern
But a lot of old people act like they’re already dead—sluggish, slow, fat, and colorless, like lead.	modern
Oh, my!	modern
You are too hot.	shakespearean
Say thou but “ay,” And that bare vowel  Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice.	shakespearean
Without his roe, like a dried herring.	shakespearean
And joy comes well in such a needy time.	shakespearean
And then I’ll be the leader of pain, and maybe I’ll lead you as far as death.	modern
Are you this impatient?	modern
Then hie you hence to Friar Lawrence’s cell.	shakespearean
What kind of devil are you to torture me like this?	modern
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun Should in the farthest east begin to draw The shady curtains from Aurora’s bed, Away from light steals home my heavy son,	shakespearean
Oh, he’s like a snake disguised as a flower.	modern
The  Right.	modern
If she was young and passionate, she’d move as fast as a ball.	modern
Oh, so light a foot Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint.	shakespearean
What’s all the noise in here?	modern
Look, and thou shalt see.	shakespearean
But I am thankful that you have found it.	modern
I swear to you— You have a good heart, and believe me, I’ll tell her that.	modern
Oh, that most wicked fiend!	modern
Not I, unless the breath of heartsick groans, Mistlike, infold me from the search of eyes.	shakespearean
A jealous woman, a jealous woman!	modern
Tell me, that I may sack The hateful mansion.	shakespearean
I have forgotten why I called you back.	modern
Oh pain!	modern
Ah, where’s my servant?—Give me some brandy.—These griefs, these pains, these sorrows make me old.	modern
Oh, in this love, you love your child so badly, that you go mad, even though she is in heaven.	modern
Hey, lady!	modern
An thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but discords.	shakespearean
He is the son and heir of old Tiberio.	modern
By the hour of nine.	shakespearean
Look, sir, here comes the lady walking toward my cell.	modern
Stay but a little.	shakespearean
Here, sir, this is a ring she asked me to give you.	modern
Romeo, come out.	modern
Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied.	shakespearean
Alas, my liege, my wife is dead tonight.	shakespearean
Have I waited so long to see this morning, only to see this?	modern
Then I’ll be quick.	modern
Go on, go on.	modern
Are you gone like that, my love, my lord?	modern
Here’s something good.	modern
From now until then seems like twenty years.	modern
Death’s the end of all.	shakespearean
Very well taken, I believe, very wise.	modern
Love will give me strength, and strength will help me accomplish this plan.	modern
Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here Shalt with him hence.	shakespearean
Go to the church.	modern
As we were trading blows, more and more people showed up to join the fight, until the Prince came and broke everyone up.	modern
I’d rather they killed me than have to live without your love.	modern
Either go someplace private, or talk it over rationally, or else just go away.	modern
Did a dragon ever hide in such a beautiful cave?	modern
By my holy order, I thought thy disposition better tempered.	shakespearean
Get thee gone, And hire those horses.	shakespearean
If you were as young as I am, if you were in love with Juliet, if you had just married her an hour ago, if then you murdered Tybalt, if you were lovesick like me, and if you were banished, then you might talk about it.	modern
What noise is this?	shakespearean
Stay not, be gone.	shakespearean
I will go along.	shakespearean
Thursday is near.	shakespearean
And what to?	shakespearean
More and more pain for us.	modern
It was a painful bruise, and she was crying bitterly.	modern
Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily.	shakespearean
Oh luck, luck.	modern
Some grief shows much of love, But much of grief shows still some want of wit.	shakespearean
Quarrel, sir?	shakespearean
Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee Doth much excuse the appertaining rage To such a greeting.	shakespearean
Now you’re sociable.	modern
How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?	shakespearean
Curse my very heart, but I think you should be happy in this second marriage, because it’s better than your first.	modern
What is her mother?	shakespearean
Is it that early in the day?	modern
I’m glad he wasn’t here for this fight.	modern
No, no.	shakespearean
Well then.	modern
Henceforward do your messages yourself.	shakespearean
That’s a certain text.	shakespearean
Eyes, look out for the last time!	modern
Villain am I none.	shakespearean
My daughter married death.	modern
I would not for the world they saw thee here.	shakespearean
That’s my good son.	shakespearean
A right good markman!	shakespearean
Give me thy hand.	shakespearean
What, mistress!	shakespearean
Tell him so yourself, And see how he will take it at your hands.	shakespearean
Well, peace be with you, sir.	shakespearean
I’m begging you, good Mercutio, let’s call it a day.	modern
We cannot be here and there too.	shakespearean
How oddly thou repliest!	shakespearean
Heaven and yourself Had part in this fair maid.	shakespearean
Every old man has worries, and worried men never get any sleep, but young men shouldn’t have a care in the world.	modern
How can I bring those promises back down to earth, unless my husband sends them back down to me by dying and going to heaven?	modern
To answer that, I should confess to you.	shakespearean
You know not what you do.	shakespearean
I think I see my cousin Tybalt’s ghost.	modern
But, as I said, On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.	shakespearean
Now, before the sun comes up and burns away the dew, I have to fill this basket of mine with poisonous weeds and medicinal flowers.	modern
But thou art not quickly moved to strike.	shakespearean
Feeling so the loss, Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.	shakespearean
Summertime in Verona has no flower as fine as him.	modern
And is he a man to encounter Tybalt?	shakespearean
Go hence.	shakespearean
Madam, your mother craves a word with you.	shakespearean
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses.	shakespearean
I wish you had my bones, and I had your news.	modern
You, good friend, save me a piece of marzipan, and if you love me, have the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.	modern
Why, bride!	shakespearean
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?	shakespearean
I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.	shakespearean
Vile earth, to earth resign.	shakespearean
Hark you, sir.	shakespearean
I will come again.	shakespearean
As much to him, else is his thanks too much.	shakespearean
Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.	shakespearean
Good morrow, Father.	shakespearean
They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.	shakespearean
I know where he is.	modern
This wind you talk of, blows us from ourselves.	shakespearean
Well, in that hit you miss.	shakespearean
I swear to you by my virginity at age twelve, I already told her to come.	modern
Oh, what learning is!	shakespearean
Was I even close to you in the chase for the goose?	modern
Look, love, what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east.	shakespearean
I asked a servant.	modern
There are two opposite elements in everything, in men as well as in herbs—good and evil.	modern
Tell me, so I can cut it out of myself.	modern
You say you do not know the lady’s mind.	shakespearean
Why are you acting so angry?	modern
Her eye in heaven Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night.	shakespearean
Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.	shakespearean
Hood my unmanned blood bating in my cheeks, With thy black mantle, till strange love, grow bold, Think true love acted simple modesty.	shakespearean
Tis no time to play now.	shakespearean
Content thee, gentle coz.	shakespearean
How doth my lady?	shakespearean
This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.	shakespearean
Could you not take some occasion without giving?	shakespearean
Do not answer me.	shakespearean
You speak well.	modern
But like I said, on the night of Lammas Eve, she will be fourteen.	modern
The curfew bell hath rung.	shakespearean
How shall that faith return again to earth, Unless that husband send it me from heaven By leaving earth?	shakespearean
Your mother is coming to your bedroom.	modern
His love is blind, so it belongs in the dark.	modern
Yes, this is what love does.	modern
Hast thou met with him?	shakespearean
Wilt thou provoke me?	shakespearean
It would have been better if, after she said, “Tybalt’s dead,” she told me my mother or my father, or both, were gone.	modern
And where the worser is predominant, Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.	shakespearean
Good morrow, cousin.	shakespearean
Was that my father who left here in such a hurry?	modern
Thou hast amazed me.	shakespearean
I can tell that you don’t know who I am.	modern
Come over here, nurse.	modern
Send your man away.	modern
Oh, God 'i' good e'en.	shakespearean
Sweet, sweet, sweet Nurse, tell me, what says my love?	shakespearean
And so, good Capulet—which name I tender As dearly as my own—be satisfied.	shakespearean
Was I with you there for the goose?	shakespearean
I  Let’s not break the law by starting a fight.	modern
Have you seen him today?	modern
I won’t miss any chance to send my love to you.	modern
An you be mine, I’ll give you to my friend.	shakespearean
That “may be” must be, love, on Thursday next.	shakespearean
Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purged.	shakespearean
What, still in tears, Evermore showering?	shakespearean
Madam, I’m here.	modern
Lay hand on heart, advise.	shakespearean
Are you really going to tell me that?	modern
And, when I do marry, I swear, it will be Romeo, whom you know I hate, rather than Paris.	modern
Perchance she cannot meet him.	shakespearean
I would be glad to forget about it, but it weighs on my memory like sins linger in guilty minds.	modern
I anger her sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer man.	shakespearean
I know not.	shakespearean
You tallow face!	shakespearean
I serve as good a man as you.	shakespearean
Oh painful day, Oh painful day!	modern
It looks to me like it’s burning in the Capulet tomb.	modern
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help, Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this knife I’ll help it presently.	shakespearean
Utter your gravity o'er a gossip’s bowl, For here we need it not.	shakespearean
The gray-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night, Checkering the eastern clouds with streaks of light, And fleckled darkness like a drunkard reels From forth day’s path and Titan’s fiery wheels.	shakespearean
Even or odd, of all days in the year, Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.	shakespearean
The world is not thy friend nor the world’s law.	shakespearean
Girls who marry so young grow up too soon.	modern
Oh, much I fear some ill unthrifty thing.	shakespearean
Give me my sin back.	modern
The heavens do lour upon you for some ill. Move them no more by crossing their high will.	shakespearean
Some say the lark makes sweet division.	shakespearean
Well, death is the end for everybody.	modern
Hang out?” Who do you think we are, musicians in a band?	modern
Tell me seriously, who is the one you love?	modern
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife, And all those twenty could but kill one life.	shakespearean
Probably because my cousin the villain would have killed my husband.	modern
Most miserable hour that e'er time saw In lasting labor of his pilgrimage.	shakespearean
Fie, how my bones ache!	shakespearean
Yea, noise?	shakespearean
But tell me seriously who it is.	modern
What about that?	modern
Why, such is love’s transgression.	shakespearean
No we’re not—it’s night.	modern
Just cry out, “Ah me!” Just say “love” and “dove.” Say just one lovely word to my good friend	modern
Are you biting your thumb at us?	modern
I’m not going to bed tonight.	modern
Now art thou Romeo.	shakespearean
Thou art like one of those fellows that, when he enters the confines of a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table and says “God send me no need of thee!” and, by the operation of the second cup, draws it on the drawer when indeed there is no need.	shakespearean
What’s he that now is going out of door?	shakespearean
So shalt thou show me friendship.	shakespearean
Come, Romeo.	shakespearean
There lies that Tybalt.	shakespearean
For when you cut your shin.	modern
Take my remark in whichever sense you like.	modern
Talk no more.	shakespearean
Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banishèd.	shakespearean
Oh, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!	shakespearean
Your part in her you could not keep from death, But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.	shakespearean
I beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give.	shakespearean
Hence “banishèd” is banished from the world, And world’s exile is death.	shakespearean
My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven.	shakespearean
Oh, that she knew she were!	shakespearean
Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.	shakespearean
Is it my mother?	modern
Oh, sad day!	modern
I am content, if that’s the way you want it.	modern
Eyes, look your last.	shakespearean
Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.	shakespearean
Wherefore art thou Romeo?	shakespearean
Lose nothing?	modern
Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time, But I will watch you from such watching now.	shakespearean
A lantern, slaughtered youth, For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes This vault a feasting presence full of light.	shakespearean
What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?	shakespearean
Didn’t you argue it out with your tailor for wearing one of his new suits before the right season?	modern
Either put away your sword or use it to help me stop this fight.	modern
Then I will give you the serving creature.	shakespearean
Why the devil came you between us?	shakespearean
I remember very well where I should be, and here I am.	modern
Just say “Yes” and I will turn more poisonous than the snake with the evil eye.	modern
Come, come with me, and we’ll do the job quickly.	modern
A greater power than we can fight has ruined our plan.	modern
I pray, sir, can you read?	shakespearean
Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight.	shakespearean
It’s all the same.	modern
Oh, she knew very well that you were acting like you were in love without really knowing what love means.	modern
Oh, I was such a beast to be angry at him.	modern
Is this the poultice for my aching bones?	shakespearean
Oh, you’re just going to talk about banishment again.	modern
One fairer than my love?	shakespearean
Yes,” said my husband, “Did you fall on your face?	modern
If he says anything against me, I’ll humble him, even if he were stronger than he is—and twenty punks like him.	modern
Oh, by this count I’ll be many years older before I see my Romeo again.	modern
It’s Mercutio’s relative, noble Count Paris!	modern
Now, before God, our whole city owes this friar a great debt.	modern
Goodness, it’s daylight.	modern
Oh, he’s a lovely gentleman.	shakespearean
I wouldn’t insult him in my own house for all the wealth in this town.	modern
Indeed, I should have asked thee that before.	shakespearean
You won’t get any bad cooks from me.	modern
Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her.	shakespearean
Not having that which, having, makes them short.	shakespearean
If I had, my weapon should quickly have been out, I warrant you.	shakespearean
You’re wearing dancing shoes with nimble soles.	modern
We follow thee.—Juliet, the county stays.	shakespearean
Hadst thou no poison mixed, no sharp-ground knife, No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean, But “banishèd” to kill me?—“Banishèd”!	shakespearean
Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet, Hath sent a letter to his father’s house.	shakespearean
Confusion’s cure lives not In these confusions.	shakespearean
Don’t saints and pilgrims have lips too?	modern
Let it go.	modern
There has never been so black a day as today.	modern
Her vestal livery is but sick and green, And none but fools do wear it.	shakespearean
Only God knows when we’ll meet again.	modern
Curse your families!	modern
It was the nightingale, and not the lark, That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear.	shakespearean
O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio is dead!	shakespearean
He killed your relative, brave Mercutio, and then young Romeo killed him.	modern
Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone.	shakespearean
Now, I swear by Saint Peter’s Church and Peter too, he will not make me a joyful bride there.	modern
O Lord, they fight!	shakespearean
I’ll go to lunch.	modern
To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty.	shakespearean
Oh, blessed, blessed night!	modern
Goodbye, dear Father.	modern
I’ll teach you a lesson.	modern
Look, she’s come home from confession with a happy look on her face.	modern
I’ll make you sing.	modern
Death is my heir.	modern
Where are the vile beginners of this fray?	shakespearean
She’s not talking to me.	modern
Go, you old housewife, go.	modern
I’m involved in your rivalry.	modern
Verona’s summer hath not such a flower.	shakespearean
Oh, he is even in my mistress' case, Just in her case.	shakespearean
Well go on home.	modern
Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play, Alone, in company, still my care hath been To have her matched.	shakespearean
Oh, Tybalt, Tybalt, he was the best friend I had.	modern
Make haste, make haste, sirrah.	shakespearean
Believe me, I’m sorry you’re in pain.	modern
No, not until Thursday.	modern
That is the key to long-lasting love.	modern
The heads of the maids?	shakespearean
They both begin with the letter “R.” Ah, you jokester—that’s the dog’s name.	modern
Come, I’ll dispose of thee Among a sisterhood of holy nuns.	shakespearean
But go ahead and charm her, gentle Paris; make her love you.	modern
Well, what was yours?	shakespearean
You’re in love?	modern
They are crying and moaning over Tybalt’s corpse.	modern
Get away from here and leave me.	modern
I am the youngest man by that name, because there is no one younger, or worse.	modern
Most detestable Death, by thee beguiled, By cruel, cruel thee quite overthrown!	shakespearean
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it, And yet I would it were to give again.	shakespearean
Romeo, are you crazy?	modern
Yea, is the worst well?	shakespearean
Tell me so I can be satisfied.	modern
What are you, girl?	modern
Romeo’s a dishclout to him.	shakespearean
Now please listen, sir.	modern
The  Get out of here!	modern
By nine o'clock.	modern
Ay, ay, the cords.	shakespearean
Out upon you!	shakespearean
He speaks not true.	shakespearean
Call to him, Mercutio.	modern
Speak one rhyme, and I’ll be satisfied.	modern
May God in heaven bless you.	modern
If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news By playing it to me with so sour a face.	shakespearean
Put your hand on your heart and listen to my advice.	modern
I drew to part them.	shakespearean
Dead art thou!	shakespearean
Oh sweet Nurse, what news do you bring?	modern
Or, if he wrote down his thoughts, give me his letter.	modern
He was my brother’s son!	modern
Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.	shakespearean
O happy dagger, This is thy sheath.	shakespearean
Take this.	modern
The boy gives warning something doth approach.	shakespearean
O woeful sympathy, Piteous predicament!	shakespearean
He’s a raven with the feathers of the dove.	modern
For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.	shakespearean
Break it up.” Then he jumped in between them and forced them to put their swords down.	modern
O' Thursday be it, then.— Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed.	shakespearean
Is the Prince’s punishment any less awful than doomsday?	modern
Some say the lark makes a sweet division between day and night.	modern
So get out of here!	modern
Find thou the means, and I’ll find such a man.	shakespearean
Oh, then I see that madmen have no ears.	shakespearean
Therefore, the fact that you’re awake this early tells me you’ve been upset with some anxiety.	modern
What if this mixture doesn’t work at all?	modern
I’m sure you have your hands full preparing for the sudden festivities.	modern
What, lamb!	shakespearean
But please tell me, can you read anything you see?	modern
Need you my help?	shakespearean
The earth, that’s nature’s mother, is her tomb.	shakespearean
Yes, if I know the language and the letters.	modern
Tis since the earthquake now eleven years, And she was weaned—I never shall forget it— Of all the days of the year, upon that day.	shakespearean
Can God be so jealous and hateful?	modern
Oh, thou wilt speak again of banishment.	shakespearean
My baby hawk?	modern
You mean their  Cut off their heads, take their maidenheads—whatever.	modern
Romeo’s a dishcloth compared to him.	modern
I am aweary.	shakespearean
Do you quarrel, sir?	shakespearean
She and Susan—God rest her and all Christian souls—were born on the same day.	modern
We have a little dessert coming up.	modern
O rude unthankfulness!	shakespearean
Then plainly know my heart’s dear love is set On the fair daughter of rich Capulet.	shakespearean
I’ll give him equal thanks, so we’re even.	modern
The world doesn’t make laws to make you rich.	modern
I will bring you thither.	shakespearean
A greater power than we can contradict Hath thwarted our intents.	shakespearean
When good manners shall lie all in one or two men’s hands, and they unwashed too, ’tis a foul thing.	shakespearean
I’ll send my eyes to prison, and they’ll never be free to look at anything again.	modern
Oh, that I were a glove upon that hand That I might touch that cheek!	shakespearean
To wreak the love I bore my cousin Upon his body that slaughtered him!	shakespearean
No, not a sad song.	modern
Go ask.	modern
Cheers, boys.	modern
Her body sleeps in the Capulet tomb, and her immortal soul lives with the angels in heaven.	modern
Go in, and tell my lady I am gone, Having displeased my father, to Lawrence’s cell To make confession and to be absolved.	shakespearean
No matter.	modern
I made my father angry, so I went to Friar Lawrence’s cell to confess and be forgiven.	modern
Well, you have made a foolish choice.	modern
Here’s drink.	shakespearean
Even such delight Among fresh fennel buds shall you this night Inherit at my house.	shakespearean
The world is not your friend, and neither is the law.	modern
Ay, boy, ready.	shakespearean
So ho!	shakespearean
To our house.	shakespearean
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows, Being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair.	shakespearean
Sometimes she tickles a priest’s nose with a  Enough, enough!	modern
Stand, an you be a man.	shakespearean
For what purpose, love?	shakespearean
You’ll fall backward when you grow up, won’t you, Jule?” And she stopped crying and said, “Yes.” Now you stop too, Nurse, please.	modern
By my head, here comes the Capulets.	shakespearean
I’ll fight you.	modern
Thou dost not mark me.	shakespearean
Shame come to Romeo!	shakespearean
I am not for this ambling.	shakespearean
It’s been longer, it’s been longer.	modern
We’re talking here in a public place.	modern
Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.	shakespearean
How can this be?	modern
It’s the lark that sings so out of tune, making such harsh noise.	modern
Go, you cot-quean, go.	shakespearean
Yon light is not daylight, I know it, I.	shakespearean
Young men’s love then lies Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.	shakespearean
I have forgot why I did call thee back.	shakespearean
I didn’t tell you to get rid of one love and replace her with another.	modern
Within an hour, one of my men will come to you behind the abbey wall and give you a rope ladder.	modern
Despised, distressed, hated, martyred, killed!	modern
Stand up if you’re really a man.	modern
What must be shall be.	shakespearean
Give me comfort.	modern
I had put bitter wormwood on my breast as I was sitting in the sun, under the wall of the dovehouse.	modern
What crimes happen so early in the morning that I have to wake up before the usual time?	modern
Indeed, my child, at Saint Peter’s Church early Thursday morning, the gallant, young, and noble gentleman Count Paris will happily make you a joyful bride.	modern
You’ll fight with a man who’s cracking nuts just because you have hazelnut-colored eyes.	modern
She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair, To merit bliss by making me despair.	shakespearean
This shall determine that.	shakespearean
Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.	shakespearean
And if you leave me so, you do me wrong.	shakespearean
Somebody’s knocking.	modern
The women you rape are the ones who’ll have to “sense” it.	modern
How sweet it would be to actually have the woman I love, when merely thinking about love makes me so happy.	modern
Being holiday, the beggar’s shop is shut.	shakespearean
Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes.	shakespearean
What, have you dined at home?	shakespearean
She’s shut inside a dead man’s tomb!	modern
For Juliet’s sake, for her sake, rise and stand.	shakespearean
Everything you told me I already knew.	modern
Thy drugs are quick.	shakespearean
Then don’t move while I act out my prayer.	modern
There were twenty Montagues fighting in this awful riot, and together those twenty could only kill one man.	modern
O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do.	shakespearean
Sweet, sweet, sweet Nurse, tell me, what did my love Romeo say?	modern
Then say at once what thou dost know in this.	shakespearean
Oh, think’st thou we shall ever meet again?	shakespearean
Even if it’s not better, your first marriage is over.	modern
Hey, Nurse!	modern
You’ll not endure him!	shakespearean
Well, I’m glad about this.	modern
The most you sought was her promotion, For ’twas your heaven she should be advanced.	shakespearean
Seriously, cousin, I love a woman.	modern
How sound asleep she is!	modern
We talk here in the public haunt of men.	shakespearean
Therefore, farewell.	shakespearean
And art thou changed?	shakespearean
I stretch my joke for that word “fat.” If you add that word to the word “goose,” it shows that you are a fat goose.	modern
In bed asleep while they do dream things true.	shakespearean
Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness, And fear’st to die?	shakespearean
Hie to your chamber.	shakespearean
Now, good sweet Nurse— O Lord, why look’st thou sad?	shakespearean
Have you got leave to go to shrift today?	shakespearean
More validity, More honorable state, more courtship lives In carrion flies than Romeo.	shakespearean
You scolded me often for loving Rosaline.	modern
Alright, here’s the vial.	modern
O, teach me how I should forget to think!	shakespearean
Ay, a thousand times.—Peter!	shakespearean
Oh, here Will I set up my everlasting rest, And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars From this world-wearied flesh.	shakespearean
He deserves only honor, complete honor.	modern
Therefore love moderately.	shakespearean
Bliss be upon you!	shakespearean
You have more wild goose in one of your jokes than I have in five of mine.	modern
I must hence to wait.	shakespearean
Onward, lover boys!	modern
So thrive my soul— A thousand times good night!	shakespearean
Your wild actions resemble the irrational fury of a beast.	modern
Oh, no.	shakespearean
And then, I hope, you’ll be satisfied.	modern
O lamentable day!	shakespearean
What a man are you?	shakespearean
So what?	modern
In my desperate situation, I have to act alone.	modern
I’ll bite my thumb at them.	modern
She’s calling out my name as if I were a bullet murdering her, just like I murdered her relative.	modern
Go, tell the Prince.	modern
Tis well thou art not fish.	shakespearean
Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone.	shakespearean
Tybalt, my cousin!	shakespearean
You  But, uncle, we’re being disrespected.	modern
Too fast is as bad as too slow.	modern
Talk not to me, for I’ll not speak a word.	shakespearean
Are you speaking from your heart?	modern
And Juliet’s just as much in love as he, but she has even less opportunity to meet her lover.	modern
Why, she is within.	shakespearean
I’ll not to bed tonight.	shakespearean
Go waken Juliet.	shakespearean
Here’s a drink.	modern
I am not I if there be such an  Or those eyes shut that makes thee answer “ay.” If he be slain, say “ay,” or if not, “no.” Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.	shakespearean
Thou chid’st me oft for loving Rosaline.	shakespearean
Father, what news?	shakespearean
He was not born to shame.	shakespearean
Where’s Potpan?	modern
Madam, your mother wants to talk to you.	modern
Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit, Which, like a usurer, abound’st in all And usest none in that true use indeed Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.	shakespearean
Mass, and well said.	shakespearean
God bless you.	modern
Hey, mistress!	modern
I hate the word peace like I hate hell, all Montagues, and you.	modern
Who knocks so hard?	shakespearean
Ah, welladay!	shakespearean
And trust me, love, in my eye so do you.	shakespearean
Welcome from Mantua.	shakespearean
My words would bounce her to my sweet love, and his words would bounce her back to me.	modern
I hear some noise.	modern
Romeo cried out, “Stop, my friends.	modern
Hey, love, I say!	modern
Go, be gone.	shakespearean
Have you importuned him by any means?	shakespearean
Please, sir, have patience.	modern
Well, you have given me great comfort.	modern
You go to Friar Lawrence’s cell.	modern
How is my wife?	modern
Come, stir, stir, stir!	shakespearean
I’m arresting you as a criminal.	modern
Send for the Count.	modern
My daughter he hath wedded.	shakespearean
Why do you complain about your birth, the heavens, and the earth?	modern
Please, young man, don’t make me angry.	modern
Get on your way and hire those horses.	modern
Get up.	modern
I think it’s too rough, too rude, too rowdy, and it pricks like a thorn.	modern
What is your will?	shakespearean
Let me stand here till thou remember it.	shakespearean
And I’ll still stay, to have thee still forget, Forgetting any other home but this.	shakespearean
And here I stand, both to impeach and purge, Myself condemnèd and myself excused.	shakespearean
But I’ve been sent to find the people whose names are written on this list, and I can’t read!	modern
Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks.	shakespearean
A sick man in sadness makes his will, A word ill urged to one that is so ill.	shakespearean
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years.	shakespearean
Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff.	shakespearean
God ye good e'en, fair gentlewoman.	shakespearean
Wednesday is tomorrow.	shakespearean
I hit hard when I’m angry.	modern
Tis torture and not mercy.	shakespearean
Although you bring me joy, I can’t take joy in this exchange of promises tonight.	modern
Well, girl, you’re weeping not for his death as much as for the fact that the villain who killed him is still alive.	modern
Is he gone and hath nothing?	shakespearean
Love’s messengers should be thoughts, which fly ten times faster than sunbeams.	modern
Tybalt is lying over there.	modern
There’s no point in looking for him if he doesn’t want to be found.	modern
They have made worms' meat of me.	shakespearean
Have you had lunch yet?	modern
Can’t you wait for a moment?	modern
Here’s goodly gear.	shakespearean
This sight of death is like a bell that warns me I’m old and I’ll die soon.	modern
Yea,” quoth my husband, “Fall’st upon thy face?	shakespearean
And too soon marred are those so early made.	shakespearean
It is best to marry well and die young, better than to be married for a long time.	modern
Then weep no more.	shakespearean
I’ll play the housewife for this once.	shakespearean
Why, isn’t all this joking better than groaning about love?	modern
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee here.	shakespearean
O love!	shakespearean
What do you want?	modern
She will  A pimp!	modern
This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what.	shakespearean
Oh, here’s a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch narrow to an ell broad!	shakespearean
Their unfortunate deaths put an end to their parents' feud.	modern
Oh, go away!	modern
Come on, you can be as angry as any guy in Italy when you’re in the mood.	modern
Well, Susan is with God.	shakespearean
To our house.	modern
Come on, wake up, wake up, wake up!	modern
Get you to bed, faith.	shakespearean
Happily met, my lady and my wife.	shakespearean
Young son, it argues a distempered head So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.	shakespearean
Ay me, what news?	shakespearean
Therefore turn and draw.	shakespearean
Oh, the people in the street cry “Romeo,” Some “Juliet,” and some “Paris,” and all run With open outcry toward our monument.	shakespearean
How now?	shakespearean
Lord, Lord, she’ll be a happy woman.	modern
Now that you are down there, you look like someone dead in the bottom of a tomb.	modern
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure Thou art uproused by some distemperature.	shakespearean
Where’s Potpan, that he helps not to take away?	shakespearean
That is a certain truth.	modern
More light and light it grows.	shakespearean
I’ll find your servant, and he’ll update you now and then on your case as it stands here.	modern
If you leave me like this, you’re doing me wrong.	modern
I bet it’s a challenge.	modern
An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.	shakespearean
Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.	shakespearean
If there were two men like you, pretty soon there’d be none because the two of you would kill each other.	modern
Tybalt is dead, and Romeo has been banished.	modern
The clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse.	shakespearean
Dost thou love me?	shakespearean
Let’s get away, Tybalt.	modern
Romeo slew him; he slew Mercutio.	shakespearean
I wish that no one could avenge my cousin’s death except me!	modern
I’ll be with thee straight.	shakespearean
Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied, And vice sometime by action dignified.	shakespearean
Tybalt, that murderer, which way did he run?	modern
Out, alas!	shakespearean
Give my regards to your lady, and tell her to hurry everybody in the house to bed.	modern
Good heart, at what?	shakespearean
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?	shakespearean
What further woe conspires against mine age?	shakespearean
And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?	shakespearean
What eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?	shakespearean
Oh Friar, damned souls use the word banishment to describe hell.	modern
We can’t be in two places at once, both here and there!	modern
Boy, your words can’t excuse the harm you’ve done to me.	modern
Speakest thou from thy heart?	shakespearean
Give it to me!	modern
Now, I swear, I’m so angry that I’m shaking all over.	modern
You gave us the slip, sir, the slip.	modern
Out, you baggage!	shakespearean
Despised, distressèd, hated, martyred, killed!	shakespearean
What time tomorrow should I send a messenger to you?	modern
Tell me not, Friar, that thou hear’st of this, Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.	shakespearean
Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.	shakespearean
I will be brief, for my short date of breath Is not so long as is a tedious tale.	shakespearean
By my troth, it is well said.	shakespearean
Well, may peace be with you.	modern
Are they washing out his wounds with their tears?	modern
But by and by comes back to Romeo, Who had but newly entertained revenge, And to ’t they go like lightning, for ere I Could draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain.	shakespearean
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.	shakespearean
But when I say so, I swear she turns white as a sheet.	modern
I see that thou art poor.	shakespearean
Go tell him of this.	shakespearean
Ascend her chamber, hence, and comfort her.	shakespearean
Hurry up, hurry up.	modern
Let me be ta'en.	shakespearean
The second cock crowed.	modern
This makes me feel so much better!	modern
Put the torch out, so I can’t be seen.	modern
Good even to my ghostly confessor.	shakespearean
What with a torch!	shakespearean
Go wake Juliet.	modern
I would have made it short.	modern
Thy face is mine, and thou hast slandered it.	shakespearean
O woe!	shakespearean
I hate my name, dear saint, because my name is your enemy.	modern
What noise is here?	shakespearean
What’s this noise?	modern
Good morning, father.	modern
Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?	shakespearean
Here comes my man.	shakespearean
Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?	shakespearean
What satisfaction canst thou have tonight?	shakespearean
Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.— Now, afore God, this reverend holy friar!	shakespearean
I pray thee, chide not.	shakespearean
Go and get her dressed.	modern
Ay, forsooth.	shakespearean
I will die and leave Death everything.	modern
Ask for me tomorrow, and you’ll find me in a grave.	modern
What a man, young lady.	modern
Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes.	shakespearean
Use your clubs and spears!	modern
No words can that woe sound.	shakespearean
Whither should they come?	shakespearean
I won’t break this promise.	modern
It’s not earlier than that, I tell you.	modern
Let’s go there.	modern
This same should be the voice of Friar John.	shakespearean
Well, well, I don’t care.	modern
Be merciful, say “death,” For exile hath more terror in his look, Much more than death.	shakespearean
I wish I were Sleep and Peace, so I could spend the night with you.	modern
No, not he, though his face be better than any man’s, yet his leg excels all men’s, and for a hand and a foot and a body, though they be not to be talked on, yet they are past compare.	shakespearean
His drugs work quickly.	modern
You mean however they dare.	modern
I’m ready.	modern
And when I shall die, Take him and cut him out in little stars, And he will make the face of heaven so fine That all the world will be in love with night And pay no worship to the garish sun.	shakespearean
Perhaps you have learned it without book.	shakespearean
You shall have none ill, sir, for I’ll try if they can lick their fingers.	shakespearean
Your face is mine, and you have slandered it.	modern
Beat the drum.	modern
Just look at me kindly, and I’m invincible against their hatred.	modern
Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I’ll believe thee.	shakespearean
Oh, I’m very scared something awful has happened.	modern
A braggart, a rogue, a villain that fights by the book of arithmetic!	shakespearean
Thou shalt be loggerhead.—Good faith, ’tis day.	shakespearean
Borrow Cupid’s wings And soar with them above a common bound.	shakespearean
Hey, hurry up, hurry up!	modern
Start a fight?	modern
Where is my page?—Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.	shakespearean
Then do my lips now have the sin they took from yours?	modern
Take thou some new infection to thy eye, And the rank poison of the old will die.	shakespearean
My child, my only life, Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!— Help, help!	shakespearean
Oh, let us hence.	shakespearean
Right, and well said.	modern
Wash they his wounds with tears?	shakespearean
Tybalt, I have a reason to love you that lets me put aside the rage I should feel and excuse that insult.	modern
By my count, I was already your mother at just about your age, while you remain a virgin.	modern
Sojourn in Mantua.	shakespearean
Can heaven be so envious?	shakespearean
There is no life, but my love is dead!	modern
What o'clock tomorrow Shall I send to thee?	shakespearean
Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress.	shakespearean
I do defy thy commination And apprehend thee for a felon here.	shakespearean
Be quiet, for shame!	modern
Couple it with something.	shakespearean
Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline, Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.	shakespearean
Juliet!—Fast, I warrant her, she.— Why, lamb!	shakespearean
I’m done for.	modern
Is the news good or bad?	modern
And how doth she?	shakespearean
Commend me to thy lady, And bid her hasten all the house to bed, Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.	shakespearean
Either withdraw unto some private place, And reason coldly of your grievances, Or else depart.	shakespearean
Behind the abbey wall Within this hour my man shall be with thee And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair, Which to the high top-gallant of my joy Must be my convoy in the secret night.	shakespearean
Go to, go to.	shakespearean
More and more light.	modern
His face will make the heavens so beautiful that the world will fall in love with the night and forget about the garish sun.	modern
So stop crying.	modern
Tonight I’m having a feast that we’ve celebrated for many years.	modern
Conceit, more rich in matter than in words, Brags of his substance, not of ornament.	shakespearean
Yes, you’ve been a ladies' man in your time.	modern
But I won’t let myself fall for him any more than your permission allows.	modern
Did he get away clean?	modern
Calling death banishment is like cutting off my head with a golden ax and smiling while I’m being murdered.	modern
Curse the day this happened, but it did.	modern
Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses, Therefore use none.	shakespearean
What shall I swear by?	shakespearean
I would thou hadst my bones and I thy news.	shakespearean
Come on, what did Romeo say?	modern
I’m finished.	modern
You’ll be sick tomorrow because you’ve stayed up all night.	modern
Is that how it is, really?	modern
I had come to the deepest part of my tale, and I planned to say nothing more on the topic.	modern
Would none but I might venge my cousin’s death!	shakespearean
Don’t you have one word of joy?	modern
Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail, Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak.	shakespearean
I wish I was your bird.	modern
Buy food, and get thyself in flesh.— Come, cordial and not poison, go with me To Juliet’s grave, for there must I use thee.	shakespearean
Let’s go at it, coward!	modern
Not mad, but bound more than a madman is, Shut up in prison, kept without my food, Whipped and tormented and—Good e'en, good fellow.	shakespearean
Rest you merry!	shakespearean
The what?	shakespearean
I enjoyed a sweeter rest than sleep.	modern
Did you ne'er hear say, “Two may keep counsel, putting one away”?	shakespearean
Romeo will answer it.	shakespearean
Night is over, and day is coming.	modern
It is not day.	shakespearean
I’ll cry my tears for Romeo’s banishment when their tears are dry.	modern
Hey, are you biting your thumb at us?	modern
Oh, he’s acting just like Juliet, just like her.	modern
Our whole city is much bound to him.	shakespearean
If love is blind, it can’t hit the target.	modern
Tybalt wanted to kill you, but you killed Tybalt.	modern
Tell him so yourself, and see how he takes the news.	modern
I brought my master news of Juliet’s death.	modern
Oh, by this count I shall be much in years Ere I again behold my Romeo.	shakespearean
O, pardon me for bringing these ill news, Since you did leave it for my office, sir.	shakespearean
What should it be that is so shrieked abroad?	shakespearean
And yet thou wilt tutor me from quarreling!	shakespearean
Please, I beg you, don’t scold me.	modern
Feeling the loss like this, I can’t help but weep for him forever.	modern
Why did this have to happen now?	modern
If that’s not the case, then this must be the answer: You, Romeo, have not been to bed tonight.	modern
Can’t you understand what I’m saying?	modern
Hang him, Jack!	shakespearean
I will kiss thy lips.	shakespearean
Don’t say anything.	modern
Leave him alone.	modern
I’m not here.	modern
I was hurt under your arm.	shakespearean
Her bridegroom is here.	modern
Everything depends on this: either be out of here before the night watchmen take their positions, or leave in disguise after daybreak.	modern
I can imagine more than I can say—I have more on my mind than words.	modern
Have some others search.	modern
Let us take the law of our sides.	shakespearean
Don’t say “banishment.” From now on, you are banished from Verona.	modern
Day and night, hour after hour, all the time, at work, at play, alone, in company, my top priority has always been to find her a husband.	modern
Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries That thou hast done me.	shakespearean
Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love, An hour but married, Tybalt murderèd, Doting like me, and like me banishèd, Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair And fall upon the ground, as I do now, Taking the measure of an unmade grave.	shakespearean
Smatter with your gossips, go.	shakespearean
Teach me to forget to think!	modern
Tomorrow I’ll send the messenger.	modern
I’ve said nothing wrong.	modern
I nursed her daughter, whom you were just talking to.	modern
And everything will be alright, I promise you, wife.	modern
Now I must go to the tomb alone.	modern
Evermore weeping for your cousin’s death?	shakespearean
Who should now pay the price for Mercutio’s life?	modern
Take Cupid’s wings and fly higher than the average man.	modern
A challenge, on my life.	shakespearean
O God, did Romeo’s hand shed Tybalt’s blood?	shakespearean
Two such opposèd kings encamp them still, In man as well as herbs—grace and rude will.	shakespearean
But come on, inconsistent young man, come with me.	modern
Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit Of an old tear that is not washed off yet.	shakespearean
Ay, let the county take you in your bed.	shakespearean
Juliet lies here, and her beauty fills this tomb with light.	modern
I want to stay more than I want to go.	modern
Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child.	shakespearean
Oh, what better favor can I do for you than to kill the man who killed you with the same hand that made you die young.	modern
Go be with your love, as it was decided at your wedding.	modern
Wretched boy, you hung out with him here, and you’re going to go to heaven with him.	modern
Saints don’t move, even when they grant prayers.	modern
Oh, brother Montague, give me your hand.	modern
These times of pain are bad times for romance.	modern
What counterfeit did I give you?	shakespearean
I’d give anything to keep them from seeing you here.	modern
Curse the day!	modern
I have more care to stay than will to go.	shakespearean
No, not him, though his face is more handsome than any man’s, and his legs are prettier, and as for his hands and feet and body, they’re not much to speak of, and yet they’re beyond compare.	modern
Let wantons light of heart Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels.	shakespearean
Has Romeo killed himself?	modern
He was not born to be shameful.	modern
O flesh, flesh, how art thou fishified!	shakespearean
Welcome, gentlemen.	modern
Why, love, I say.	shakespearean
O me, O me!	shakespearean
Ha, ha!	modern
That I ask again, For nothing can be ill if she be well.	shakespearean
Well, Juliet, I’ll lie with you tonight.	modern
Hey, bride!	modern
Arms, take your last embrace.	shakespearean
You worthless girl!	modern
Sing my praises to your mistress.	modern
Have you come to make confession to this father?	modern
He says more in one minute than he does in a whole month.	modern
O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!	shakespearean
Oh, for God’s sake.	modern
Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?	shakespearean
Why do you look so upset?	modern
Give me your torch, boy.	modern
What wouldst thou have with me?	shakespearean
I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.	shakespearean
Don’t worry about me.	modern
He made you for a highway to my bed, But I, a maid, die maiden-widowèd.	shakespearean
Down with the Capulets!	modern
I see that you are poor.	modern
Do you have permission to go out and take confession today?	modern
Tis more, ’tis more.	shakespearean
Doth she not count her blessed, Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought So worthy a gentleman to be her bride?	shakespearean
Some kind of fountain?	modern
Can you not conceive?	shakespearean
By a name I know not how to tell thee who I am.	shakespearean
Do so, and tell my sweet to be ready to scold me.	modern
Have you spoken to him?	modern
And why did you come?	modern
Good morning, gentlemen.	modern
Go, girl, look for a man who’ll give you happy nights at the end of happy days.	modern
I do bite my thumb, sir.	shakespearean
I hate the word, As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.	shakespearean
Commend me to thy mistress.	shakespearean
I pledged my love to you before you asked me to.	modern
I don’t like it.	modern
Poor living corse, closed in a dead man’s tomb!	shakespearean
The fearful passage of their death-marked love And the continuance of their parents' rage, Which, but their children’s end, naught could remove, Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage— The which, if you with patient ears attend, What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.	shakespearean
Where the devil should this Romeo be?	shakespearean
I have time for you now, my sad daughter.	modern
O holy Friar, O, tell me, holy Friar, Where is my lady’s lord?	shakespearean
Now I’ll go see my priest, to ask for his help and tell him about my good luck.	modern
I tell you, he that can lay hold of her Shall have the chinks.	shakespearean
And is it not well served into a sweet goose?	shakespearean
His son is thirty.	shakespearean
Holy Father Lawrence instructed me to fall on my knees and beg your forgiveness.	modern
My child is yet a stranger in the world.	shakespearean
What, dost thou make us minstrels?	shakespearean
I’ll send to one in Mantua, Where that same banished runagate doth live, Shall give him such an unaccustomed dram That he shall soon keep Tybalt company.	shakespearean
What, Nurse, I say!	shakespearean
Benvolio is part of the Montague family.	modern
Go and trim her up.	shakespearean
Well, sir, because silver has a sweet sound.	modern
Romeo, get out of here.	modern
when ’twas a little prating thing.—Oh, there is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain lay knife aboard, but she, good soul, had as lief see a toad, a very toad, as see him.	shakespearean
Romeo will answer the challenge.	modern
His fault concludes but what the law should end, The life of Tybalt.	shakespearean
Indeed, I remember it well.	modern
Old Montague is here, and he’s waving his sword around just to make me mad.	modern
I couldn’t go to Mantua because I was stuck there.	modern
Proud,” and “I thank you,” and “I thank you not,” And yet “not proud”?	shakespearean
Tomorrow is Wednesday.	modern
The fight is between our masters, and we men who work for them.	modern
Here is a friar that trembles, sighs and weeps.	shakespearean
Madam, in happy time, what day is that?	shakespearean
Mine shall be spent When theirs are dry, for Romeo’s banishment.	shakespearean
Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night.	shakespearean
Lie thou there.	shakespearean
Herbs, plants, and stones possess great power.	modern
Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.	shakespearean
Beshrew my very heart, I think you are happy in this second match, For it excels your first.	shakespearean
Oh, this is a painful time!	modern
For shame, bring Juliet out here.	modern
Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.	shakespearean
Tell me, daughter Juliet, How stands your disposition to be married?	shakespearean
What says he of our marriage?	shakespearean
Every one prepare To follow this fair corse unto her grave.	shakespearean
I’ve found it out.	modern
What do you say, James  Well, I don’t know what to say.	modern
My noble uncle, do you know the cause?	shakespearean
Our instruments to melancholy bells, Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast.	shakespearean
But let them measure us by what they will.	shakespearean
I can tell by his voice that this man is a Montague.	modern
It’s late.	modern
It is too rough, Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.	shakespearean
A dog of that house shall move me to stand.	shakespearean
Out of love?	modern
Mercutio’s kinsman, noble County Paris.	shakespearean
He’ll wake you up, I bet.	modern
My soul, and not my child!	shakespearean
I will bite my thumb at them, which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.	shakespearean
And she as much in love, her means much less To meet her new beloved anywhere.	shakespearean
Tomorrow night make sure that you are alone.	modern
It’s already almost night.	modern
Reply not.	shakespearean
I’ll look at him and try to like him, at least if what I see is likable.	modern
With Rosaline, my ghostly Father?	shakespearean
Were you here when it started?	modern
Younger than you Here in Verona, ladies of esteem Are made already mothers.	shakespearean
With Rosaline, father?	modern
I know what I’ll do.	modern
Many a morning hath he there been seen, With tears augmenting the fresh morning’s dew, Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs.	shakespearean
Go blabber with your gossiping friends.	modern
You must contrary me.	shakespearean
She that makes dainty, She, I’ll swear, hath corns.	shakespearean
Then, window, let day in and let life out.	shakespearean
Goodbye, Goodbye!	modern
I’m locked up in a prison and deprived of food.	modern
And here stands all your state: Either be gone before the watch be set, Or by the break of day disguised from hence.	shakespearean
I’ll make this wedding happen tomorrow morning.	modern
Do you have news from Verona!—What is it, Balthasar?	modern
O calm dishonourable, vile submission!	shakespearean
Romeo is banishèd.” There is no end, no limit, measure, bound, In that word’s death.	shakespearean
Do not deny to him that you love me.	shakespearean
Peter, wait for me at the gate.	modern
May a plague strike both your houses.	modern
Ah, my back, my back!	shakespearean
I’m whipped and tortured— May God give you a good evening.	modern
The strangers are all gone.	modern
Pick up this rope ladder.	modern
What, ho!	shakespearean
The citizens are around, and Tybalt is dead.	modern
Romeo can, Though heaven cannot.	shakespearean
What did my man say?	modern
And tell her, listen to me, on Wednesday—Wait—What day is today?	modern
What is this blood that stains the stony entrance of this tomb?	modern
Wake up the Montagues.	modern
Do you bring me a letter from the friar?	modern
A little bit of grief shows a lot of love.	modern
Very well took, i' faith, wisely, wisely.	shakespearean
I can read my own fortune in my misery.	modern
What is this?	modern
And there she shall at Friar Lawrence' cell Be shrived and married.	shakespearean
Blistered be thy tongue For such a wish!	shakespearean
Romeo ran away when Tybalt fell dead.	modern
But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench, Thou pout’st upon thy fortune and thy love.	shakespearean
Yet I cannot choose but laugh To think it should leave crying and say “ay.” And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow A bump as big as a young cockerel’s stone, A perilous knock, and it cried bitterly.	shakespearean
Should I believe that death is in love with you, and that the awful monster keeps you here to be his mistress?	modern
The all-seeing sun Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.	shakespearean
Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed.	shakespearean
We took this mattock and this spade from him As he was coming from this churchyard’s side.	shakespearean
Then I’ll call you a serving-creature.	modern
Let playful people with light hearts dance.	modern
Then she is well, and nothing can be ill.	shakespearean
Is love really tender?	modern
O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!	shakespearean
His crime did justice’s job by taking Tybalt’s life.	modern
And if I cannot, I’ll find those that shall.	shakespearean
Things have turned out so unluckily, sir, that we haven’t had time to convince our daughter to marry you.	modern
Ah me!	shakespearean
Virginity makes her look sick and green.	modern
I hear a noise inside.	modern
Your humor is a spicy sauce.	modern
I have a soul of lead So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.	shakespearean
Here is a friar who’s trembling, sighing and weeping.	modern
God ye good morrow, gentlemen.	shakespearean
That sounds like the voice of Friar John.	modern
Why are you still crying?	modern
May a plague curse both your families.	modern
You will not then?	shakespearean
No money, on my faith, but the gleek.	shakespearean
Flies can kiss her, but I must flee the city.	modern
That same villain, Romeo.	shakespearean
Fie, fie!	shakespearean
They are free men, but I am banishèd.	shakespearean
Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest.	shakespearean
Then will I lay the serving creature’s dagger on your pate.	shakespearean
I must another way To fetch a ladder, by the which your love Must climb a bird’s nest soon when it is dark.	shakespearean
Don’t swear at all.	modern
They’re calling for dates and quinces in the pastry kitchen.	modern
He bears him like a portly gentleman, And, to say truth, Verona brags of him To be a virtuous and well-governed youth.	shakespearean
Where are my father and my mother, Nurse?	modern
And when I do, I swear It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate, Rather than Paris.	shakespearean
If I can trust my dreams, then some joyful news is coming soon.	modern
Here, here I’ll remain with worms that are your chamber-maids.	modern
It’s out of fashion to give lengthy explanations like that.	modern
They should get to bed early and get plenty of sleep.	modern
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.	shakespearean
Come, civil night, Thou sober-suited matron, all in black, And learn me how to lose a winning match Played for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.	shakespearean
Indeed, I should have asked you before who he was.	modern
Well, we can put away our pipes and go home.	modern
Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly, for one would kill the other.	shakespearean
You are a saucy boy.	shakespearean
What must be will be.	modern
So stay for a while.	modern
I’ll go along, no such sight to be shown, But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.	shakespearean
Here lies the county slain, And Juliet bleeding, warm and newly dead, Who here hath lain these two days buried.— Go, tell the Prince.	shakespearean
Oh Lord, they’re fighting!	modern
Is it now afternoon?	modern
But where hast thou been, then?	shakespearean
Clubs, bills, and partisans!	shakespearean
O my brother’s child!	shakespearean
An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live.	shakespearean
Fly hence and leave me.	shakespearean
I will, and know her mind early tomorrow.	shakespearean
I will be brief because I’m not going to live long enough to tell a boring story.	modern
I stretch it out for that word “broad,” which, added to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.	shakespearean
It is “music with her silver sound,” because musicians have no gold to use to make sounds.	modern
I hear that you must marry this count on Thursday, and that nothing can delay it.	modern
Take away this body, and do what I say.	modern
Romeo, come forth.	shakespearean
That’s how flimsy and unreal pleasure is.	modern
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste, For beauty, starved with her severity, Cuts beauty off from all posterity.	shakespearean
I don’t have the thing that makes time fly.	modern
Give me the vial.	modern
For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late, It may be thought we held him carelessly, Being our kinsman, if we revel much.	shakespearean
Let’s see for means.	shakespearean
What day is this?	shakespearean
I do.	modern
I am too sore enpiercèd with his shaft To soar with his light feathers, and so bound, I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.	shakespearean
Is love a tender thing?	shakespearean
I’ll frown at them as they pass by, and they can react however they want.	modern
I am not here.	shakespearean
Sin from my lips?	modern
Are you going to say good things about the man who killed your cousin?	modern
I’ll send a man to Mantua, where that exiled rogue is living.	modern
Within three hours Juliet will wake up.	modern
From the Earth’s womb, many different sorts of plants and animals come forth, and the Earth provides her children with many excellent forms of nourishment.	modern
Tell her to come to me.	modern
Now I’ll tell you without asking.	shakespearean
Oh God, did Romeo’s hand shed Tybalt’s blood?	modern
Hie you to church.	shakespearean
Thou need’st not to be gone.	shakespearean
Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I can find young Romeo?	modern
So calm down.	modern
Who’s that calling?	modern
I have an interest in your hearts' proceeding.	shakespearean
O lamentable day!	shakespearean
Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath, Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.	shakespearean
What do you mean I faked you out?	modern
They must take it in sense that feel it.	shakespearean
He carries himself like a dignified gentleman, and, to tell you the truth, he has a reputation throughout Verona as a virtuous and well-behaved young man.	modern
Ha, banishment!	shakespearean
Is Romeo slaughtered, and is Tybalt dead?	shakespearean
They stumble that run fast.	shakespearean
Then I defy you, stars!	shakespearean
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.	shakespearean
Keep going, keep going, or I’ll declare myself the winner.	modern
Look, my love, what are those streaks of light in the clouds parting in the east?	modern
Show yourself in the form of a sigh.	modern
So, where should we eat?	modern
Give me leave awhile.	shakespearean
Destructive thoughts come quickly to the minds of desperate men!	modern
For himself to ruin,” he says.	modern
I don’t know his name.	modern
Spare not for the cost.	shakespearean
Faith, I know not what to say.	shakespearean
I am the greatest, but I was able to do the least.	modern
Thou know’st the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight.	shakespearean
Girls younger than she often marry and become happy mothers.	modern
If you could, you couldn’t bring him back to life.	modern
Our celebratory hymns will change to sad funeral marches.	modern
That dreamers often lie.	shakespearean
Then have at you with my wit.	shakespearean
Switch and spurs, switch and spurs, or I’ll cry a match.	shakespearean
How long has he been there?	modern
I am no villain.	modern
Look thou but sweet, And I am proof against their enmity.	shakespearean
I wish the fool were dead and married to her grave!	modern
He’s thirty years old.	modern
Thus with a kiss I die.	shakespearean
Where should she be?	shakespearean
I have my naked sword out.	modern
My husband is alive on earth, my vows of marriage are in heaven.	modern
The time is very short.	shakespearean
Oh my, what’s the news?	modern
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?	shakespearean
I am tired.	modern
He’s alive and victorious, and Mercutio’s dead?	modern
Come, thou day in night, For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night Whiter than new snow upon a raven’s back.	shakespearean
Either my eyesight is failing me, or you look pale.	modern
All men call thee fickle.	shakespearean
Good night, good night.	modern
Tell me, Friar, in what part of my body is my name embedded?	modern
O heavens!	shakespearean
Your life insurance?	modern
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand.	shakespearean
Ha, banishment?	modern
Your houses!	shakespearean
I’ll tell you before you have to ask me again.	modern
What, are you mad?	shakespearean
I hope you enjoy the same sweet peace and rest I feel in my heart.	modern
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven, Having some business, do entreat her eyes To twinkle in their spheres till they return.	shakespearean
You take your pennyworths now.	shakespearean
I will give you the minstrel.	shakespearean
O Lord, I could stay here all night listening to such good advice.	modern
What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?	shakespearean
If the news is good, you’re ruining the sweet news by playing a trick with a sour face like that.	modern
Delay this marriage for a month, a week.	shakespearean
Tush, thou art deceived.	shakespearean
Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.	shakespearean
Out, you green sickness, carrion!	shakespearean
What hast thou found?	shakespearean
Have you told her our decision?	modern
But like a misbehaved, sullen girl, you’re whining about your bad luck and your love.	modern
Oh, you’re wrong.	modern
What is this fuzzy logic?	modern
A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.	shakespearean
It’s a good thing you’re not a piece of fish.	modern
Nay, if our wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five.	shakespearean
Farewell, farewell.	shakespearean
God 'i' good e'en.	shakespearean
Have you given up so quickly on Rosaline, whom you loved so much?	modern
Romeo killed Tybalt.	modern
The excuse you make to delay the news is longer than the news itself.	modern
If love plays rough with you, play rough with  Come on, let’s knock and go in.	modern
Has Romeo been killed, and is Tybalt dead too?	modern
Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast.	shakespearean
Romeo must die.	modern
No, I haven’t had lunch.	modern
Brother, ho!	shakespearean
This bud of love, by summer’s ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.	shakespearean
Tush, I will stir about, And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife.	shakespearean
Oh, are you going to leave me so unsatisfied?	modern
I drew my sword to part them.	modern
Thou villain Capulet!	shakespearean
I want my sword.	modern
Is ’t good or bad?	shakespearean
Oh, there’s my lady!	modern
I make her angry sometimes by saying that Paris is more handsome than you are.	modern
She’s not fourteen.	shakespearean
Lucentio’s son is older than that, sir.	modern
O woeful day, O woeful day!	shakespearean
Don’t you have a letter for me from the friar?	modern
No gentlemen, don’t get ready to go now.	modern
What less than doomsday is the Prince’s doom?	shakespearean
She disgusts me, the little hussy!	modern
But I’ll write again to Mantua, and I’ll keep her in my cell until Romeo comes.	modern
Therefore we’ll have some half a dozen friends, And there an end.	shakespearean
Think about the ones who have died.	modern
How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night, Like softest music to attending ears!	shakespearean
She’s not even fourteen.	modern
Didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter?	shakespearean
Are you a man?	modern
Young Romeo is it?	shakespearean
Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears?	shakespearean
If I do so, it will be of more price Being spoke behind your back than to your face.	shakespearean
The things I’m saying are fair and honest.	modern
How is my Juliet?	modern
Honest Nurse, farewell.	shakespearean
See where she comes from shrift with merry look.	shakespearean
Mercutio, you hang out with Romeo.	modern
Thursday it is, then.	modern
Your love says, like an honorable gentleman, who is courteous, kind, handsome, and, I believe, virtuous— where is your mother?	modern
Think about it.	modern
Take away the stools, the sideboards, and the plates.	modern
Were you by when it began?	shakespearean
Where are the evil men who started this fight?	modern
Oh cousin, cousin!	modern
You’re not paying attention to me.	modern
Well, sir.	shakespearean
My generosity to you is as limitless as the sea, and my love is as deep.	modern
Just ignore him.	modern
Don’t you see that I’m out of breath?	modern
What further pain must I endure in my old age?	modern
And now you cry, even though she has risen up above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?	modern
Oh, she’s slow!	modern
Under love’s heavy burden do I sink.	shakespearean
And yet you’re the one who wants to teach me about restraint!	modern
I will kiss your lips.	modern
Do not say “banishment.” Hence from Verona art thou banishèd.	shakespearean
Why, no.	shakespearean
No, coz, I rather weep.	shakespearean
Tybalt is dead, and Romeo has been banished.”	modern
My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.— My lord, we must entreat the time alone.	shakespearean
Strike, drum.	shakespearean
Is ’t so, indeed?	shakespearean
Go with me to the tomb.	modern
How can I marry him, this husband, before he comes to court me?	modern
Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?	shakespearean
Didn’t he come home last night?	modern
Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while, Till we can clear these ambiguities And know their spring, their head, their true descent, And then will I be general of your woes, And lead you even to death.	shakespearean
Therefore, love each other in moderation.	modern
I like it not.	shakespearean
Come, what says Romeo?	shakespearean
Howling attends it.	shakespearean
Are you trying to start a fight?	modern
So now turn and draw your sword.	modern
What are they, beseech your ladyship?	shakespearean
Two, two—a shirt and a smock.	shakespearean
I hear you say “proud” and “I thank you,” and then “no thank you” and “not proud,” you spoiled little girl.	modern
Therefore be patient.	shakespearean
What, not a word?	shakespearean
I’ll follow after you.	modern
You will feel the loss, but the man you weep for will feel nothing.	modern
And so, good Capulet—which is a name I love like my own name—you should be satisfied with what I say.	modern
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?	shakespearean
I will follow you.	shakespearean
That fair-skinned, hard-hearted hussy, Rosaline is going to torment him until he goes insane.	modern
Thursday is coming.	modern
I hope sores cover your tongue for a wish like that!	modern
Take these keys and get more spices, Nurse.	modern
I swear by my holy order, I thought you were smarter and more rational than this.	modern
Where is my lord?	shakespearean
To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand.	shakespearean
Hath Romeo slain himself?	shakespearean
Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.	shakespearean
Madam, tell me quickly, what day is that?	modern
I nursed her daughter that you talked withal.	shakespearean
Well, Susan died and is with God.	modern
I hear some noise within.	shakespearean
You’re right.	modern
We’ll to church tomorrow.	shakespearean
I’ll lay fourteen of my teeth—and yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four—she is not fourteen.	shakespearean
Hold him in custody until the Prince gets here.	modern
I hear some noise.	shakespearean
I won’t hide unless all the mist from my heartsick groans envelopes me like fog and conceals me from people’s searching eyes.	modern
And death, not Romeo, can take my virginity!	modern
Tis twenty year till then.	shakespearean
Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not there for the goose.	shakespearean
My sword, I say!	shakespearean
I would the fool were married to her grave!	shakespearean
Here in Verona there are girls younger than you—girls from noble families—who have already become mothers.	modern
Serve God.	shakespearean
If we look like musicians to you, you can expect to hear nothing but noise.	modern
Meantime I writ to Romeo, That he should hither come as this dire night, To help to take her from her borrowed grave, Being the time the potion’s force should cease.	shakespearean
I’ll find Romeo to comfort you.	modern
Warrant thee, my man’s as true as steel.	shakespearean
Out here everybody can see us.	modern
Take thou that.	shakespearean
That light is not daylight, I know it.	modern
Or if it did not, Your first is dead, or ’twere as good he were, As living here and you no use of him.	shakespearean
What’s going on, Juliet?	modern
Are you going to provoke me?	modern
Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I may find the young Romeo?	shakespearean
My naked weapon is out.	shakespearean
If you who are so wise can’t help, please be kind enough to call my solution wise.	modern
If you sink, you’re dragging love down.	modern
My back a' t' other side.	shakespearean
You know where I live.	modern
There’s plenty of time.	modern
Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.	shakespearean
Raise up the Montagues.	shakespearean
But I pray, can you read anything you see?	shakespearean
That guy’s funny.	modern
Yes, pilgrim—they have lips that they’re supposed to pray with.	modern
As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine, And all combined, save what thou must combine By holy marriage.	shakespearean
Do as you please, because I’m done worrying about you.	modern
Tell her about my son Paris’s love for her.	modern
Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting.	shakespearean
Yes, well, things could get better.	modern
Why should you fall into so deep a moan?	modern
Shame on you!	modern
You blush bright red as soon as you hear any news.	modern
Is he man enough at this point to face off with Tybalt?	modern
Away, Tybalt.	shakespearean
I’ll go, sir, and I won’t bother you.	modern
Send for the county.	shakespearean
I saw no man use you at his pleasure.	shakespearean
He lets the bird hop a little from his hand and then yanks him back by a string.	modern
Come, I’ll place you among the sisterhood of holy nuns.	modern
I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.	shakespearean
Well, we were all born to die.	modern
A merry whoreson, ha!	shakespearean
I had a dream last night.	modern
O brother Montague, give me thy hand.	shakespearean
Then I’ll really give it to you.	modern
What sayst thou, my dear Nurse?	shakespearean
Give my regards to your daughter.	modern
Why, she’s inside.	modern
He made this rope ladder to be a highway to my bed, but I am a virgin, and I will die a virgin and a widow.	modern
These are news indeed!	shakespearean
Go there and compare her objectively to some other girls I’ll show you.	modern
Let’s get out of here.	modern
My bounty is as boundless as the sea, My love as deep.	shakespearean
That’s because the murderer is alive.	modern
Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.	shakespearean
One, gentlewoman, that God hath made, himself to mar.	shakespearean
Who is that gentleman?	modern
What’s your will?	shakespearean
Madam, if you can find a man to deliver the poison, I’ll mix it myself so that Romeo will sleep quietly soon after he drinks it.	modern
I met the young man at Lawrence’s cell.	modern
Day has broken.	modern
No, ’tis not so deep as a well nor so wide as a church-door, but ’tis enough, ’twill serve.	shakespearean
No, cousin, I’m crying.	modern
Don’t say anything else.	modern
We shall be much unfurnished for this time.	shakespearean
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh!	shakespearean
Saint Francis be my speed!	shakespearean
Weeping and wailing over Tybalt’s corse.	shakespearean
The second cock hath crowed.	shakespearean
Your joke is a very bitter apple.	modern
So the cooks who can’t lick their fingers aren’t hired.	modern
Look, look!	modern
Pronounce this sentence then: Women may fall when there’s no strength in men.	shakespearean
Oh, I wish she knew how much I love her.	modern
What can he say in this?	shakespearean
So I die with a kiss.	modern
O God’s lady dear, Are you so hot?	shakespearean
Some people in the street are crying “Romeo.” Some are crying “Juliet,” and some are crying “Paris.” They’re all running in an open riot toward our tomb.	modern
Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily, That we have had no time to move our daughter.	shakespearean
Oh, then I see you’ve been with  Who’s Queen Mab?	modern
I wish I had not lived long enough to see him die.	modern
Oh, my liege, my wife died tonight.	modern
I’ll forget that I have any home besides this spot right here.	modern
Well then, I’ll say this quickly: the valiant Paris wants you as his bride.	modern
Oh, where is Romeo?	shakespearean
Tut, I have lost myself.	shakespearean
I’ll not be forsworn.	shakespearean
Please, follow straight after me.	modern
Lie down right there.	modern
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows, Came more and more and fought on part and part, Till the Prince came, who parted either part.	shakespearean
Give me my sin again.	shakespearean
More light and light, more dark and dark our woes!	shakespearean
Both with an  Ah, mocker, that’s the dog’s name.	shakespearean
And sayst thou yet that exile is not death?	shakespearean
But as soon as the sun rises in the east, my sad son comes home to escape the light.	modern
Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.	shakespearean
Death is my heir.	shakespearean
I’m losing this duel of wits.	modern
Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flowed in.	shakespearean
Why the hell did you come in between us?	modern
You know not how to choose a man.	shakespearean
Now will he sit under a medlar tree And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit As maids call medlars when they laugh alone.— O Romeo, that she were!	shakespearean
Now art thou sociable.	shakespearean
What does he say about our marriage?	modern
Welcome, gentlemen!	shakespearean
I’ll conjure him as if I were summoning a spirit.	modern
Flies are like free men, but I have been banished.	modern
Very suspicious.	modern
Benvolio, who started this fight?	modern
You are dead!	modern
I am hurt.	shakespearean
Marry, come up, I trow.	shakespearean
If my heart’s dear love— Well, don’t swear.	modern
Nurse, give my regards to to your lady.	modern
Thou art not conquered.	shakespearean
What should I swear by?	modern
You poor soul, your face has suffered many tears.	modern
Come hither, Nurse.	shakespearean
How can you test them like that?	modern
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.	shakespearean
Signor Valentio and his cousin Tybalt, Lucio and the lively Helena.” That’s a nice group of people.	modern
Or if not so, then here I hit it right: Our Romeo hath not been in bed tonight.	shakespearean
I can see in your eyes that you’re starving.	modern
You have so much natural talent, but like someone who hoards money, you use none of your talent for the right purpose—not your body, not your love, not your mind.	modern
I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam, I will not marry yet.	shakespearean
You don’t have to go yet.	modern
Why Romeo, art thou mad?	shakespearean
Delay this marriage for a month, or a week.	modern
I can tell you, but young Romeo will be older when you find him than he was when you started looking for him.	modern
Now heaven has her.	modern
Oh, in this love, you love your child so ill That you run mad, seeing that she is well.	shakespearean
Give my compliments to your lady.	modern
Be good.	modern
But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?	shakespearean
That’s the way to show me friendship.	modern
Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the prick of noon.	shakespearean
Oh,a footstep as light as hers will never endure the rocky road of life.	modern
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?	shakespearean
And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.	shakespearean
Stay, fellow.	shakespearean
Find the people whose names are on this list?	modern
Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit, For ’tis a throne where honor may be crowned.	shakespearean
Parting is such sweet sorrow That I shall say good night till it be morrow.	shakespearean
Am I come near ye now?— Welcome, gentlemen!	shakespearean
Came he not home tonight?	shakespearean
Inside the little rind of this weak flower, there is both poison and powerful medicine.	modern
My lord, I would that Thursday were tomorrow.	shakespearean
Take my advice.	modern
When evil is dominant, death soon kills the body like cancer.	modern
O mischief, thou art swift To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!	shakespearean
Who’s calling me?	modern
Think upon these gone.	shakespearean
Don’t worry about the cost.	modern
I neither know it nor can learn of him.	shakespearean
Will you cry about your cousin’s death forever?	modern
He is hid at Lawrence' cell.	shakespearean
What an awful day!	modern
Wait good Nurse.	modern
I see thou know’st me not.	shakespearean
At Friar Lawrence’s cell she can make confession and be married.	modern
Romeo!— Alack, alack, what blood is this, which stains The stony entrance of the sepulcher?	shakespearean
Therefore, have done.	shakespearean
Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe, A villain that is hither come in spite To scorn at our solemnity this night.	shakespearean
Hence, be gone, away!	shakespearean
But come, young waverer, come, go with me, In one respect I’ll thy assistant be, For this alliance may so happy prove To turn your households' rancor to pure love.	shakespearean
The fee simple?	shakespearean
Can your man keep a secret?	modern
God mark thee to his grace!	shakespearean
Saw you him today?	shakespearean
My soul is made out of lead, and it’s so heavy it keeps me stuck on the ground so I can’t move.	modern
This cannot anger him.	shakespearean
Marry, I will, and this is wisely done.	shakespearean
Brother, I’ll go and bring it to you.	modern
Alas the day, it did.	shakespearean
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you will give me occasion.	shakespearean
Well, that one, I think, is young Petruchio.	modern
I can tell you, but young Romeo will be older when you have found him than he was when you sought him.	shakespearean
Where the devil can Romeo be?	modern
Chopped logic!	shakespearean
Down with the Capulets!	shakespearean
I swear, you speak the truth.	modern
By my heel, I care not.	shakespearean
O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?	shakespearean
Oh my!	modern
So, goodbye.	modern
What devil art thou that dost torment me thus?	shakespearean
Is it my lady mother?	shakespearean
You have the sacred power to cure both of us.	modern
Romeo, he cries aloud, “Hold, friends!	shakespearean
We are undone, lady, we are undone!	shakespearean
Hurry up, or I’ll smack you on the ears with my sword before you have yours drawn.	modern
Tsk, you’re wrong.	modern
Or, if you don’t delay, make my wedding bed in the tomb where Tybalt lies.	modern
Long love doth so.	shakespearean
Oh, I’ll rest here forever.	modern
You’re getting too angry.	modern
Although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract tonight.	shakespearean
Showing mercy by pardoning killers only causes more murders.	modern
My soul depends on it— A thousand times good night.	modern
Oh, she knew well Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell.	shakespearean
Let them judge us however they please.	modern
For a full half hour.	modern
My eyes were liars, then, because I never saw true beauty before tonight.	modern
He’s not telling the truth.	modern
Whence come you?	shakespearean
Angry enough to run away.	modern
Perhaps there’s still some poison on them, to make me die with a medicinal kiss.	modern
Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.	shakespearean
Look, look.	shakespearean
We mean well by going to this masquerade ball, but it’s not smart of us to go.	modern
I have already condemned and excused myself.	modern
I’ll go with you.	modern
I’ll find out your man, And he shall signify from time to time Every good hap to you that chances here.	shakespearean
A conduit, girl?	shakespearean
I’m happy to meet you, my lady and my wife.	modern
Thy Juliet is alive, For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead— There art thou happy.	shakespearean
Take up those cords.—Poor ropes, you are beguiled, Both you and I, for Romeo is exiled.	shakespearean
Let me alone.	shakespearean
How is it with her?	shakespearean
Let them start something.	modern
Call her forth to me.	shakespearean
Adieu, adieu!	shakespearean
Sadness takes away our color.	modern
Night’s candles are burnt out, and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.	shakespearean
Sir Paris, I’ll make a desperate argument for my child’s love.	modern
But what do you say to my request?	modern
Madam, I am here.	shakespearean
Dry sorrow drinks our blood.	shakespearean
Make haste, I say.	shakespearean
Will I be married tomorrow morning?	modern
Brother, hey!	modern
Where is my father and my mother, Nurse?	shakespearean
How should madmen hear, if wise men can’t even see?	modern
Go wisely and slowly.	modern
Good father, I’m begging you on my knees, be patient and listen to me say just one thing.	modern
Investigate how this foul murder came about.	modern
A plague o' both your houses!	shakespearean
I will confess to you that I love him.	shakespearean
Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.	shakespearean
Life, wealth, everything belongs to Death.	modern
Why dost thou wring thy hands?	shakespearean
Wilt thou be gone?	shakespearean
The Prince will give you the death penalty if you get caught.	modern
Tis he, that villain Romeo.	shakespearean
Do not swear at all.	shakespearean
Now I see the blood rushing to your cheeks.	modern
I didn’t see anybody use you for kicks.	modern
What, are you crazy?	modern
You had this child with the help of heaven.	modern
Cheerly, boys.	shakespearean
Otherwise, you’d see me blushing about the things you’ve heard me say tonight.	modern
I don’t dare, sir.	modern
It is an honor that I dream not of.	shakespearean
Not in a grave, To lay one in, another out to have.	shakespearean
I have a head, sir, that will find out logs, And never trouble Peter for the matter.	shakespearean
I swear, it must be thirty years.	modern
This is as bad as the tortures of hell.	modern
Go tell him about this.	modern
I wonder at this haste, that I must wed Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.	shakespearean
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.	shakespearean
Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age.	shakespearean
Spakest thou of Juliet?	shakespearean
Then I’ll be brief.	shakespearean
O fortune, fortune!	shakespearean
Let me stand here until you remember your reason.	modern
O comfortable Friar!	shakespearean
Go with me to the vault.	shakespearean
That’s him, that villain Romeo.	modern
Now he’ll sit under a  Let’s go.	modern
I love rich Capulet’s daughter.	modern
O noble prince, I can discover all The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.	shakespearean
I bet he slipped away and went home to bed.	modern
Yes, those are the best clothes.	modern
I pray thee, hold thy peace.	shakespearean
Ah, where’s my man?—Give me some aqua vitae.— These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.	shakespearean
Oh no!	modern
Let’s talk.	modern
Cut off their heads?	modern
Alive in triumph—and Mercutio slain!	shakespearean
There is nothing on Earth that is so evil that it does not provide the earth with some special quality.	modern
And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.	shakespearean
Therefore your relatives are no obstacle.	modern
Shall I be married then tomorrow morning?	shakespearean
But love gives them power, and time gives them the chance to meet, sweetening the extreme danger with intense pleasure.	modern
It’s still a long time until daybreak.	modern
You would take it back?	modern
That’s good, my boy.	modern
May a plague strike both your families!	modern
There is no world without Verona walls But purgatory, torture, hell itself.	shakespearean
Love’s heralds should be thoughts, Which ten times faster glide than the sun’s beams, Driving back shadows over louring hills.	shakespearean
Oh life!	modern
If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep, My dreams presage some joyful news at hand.	shakespearean
How sound is she asleep!	shakespearean
Then young men love with their eyes, not with their hearts.	modern
Right glad I am he was not at this fray.	shakespearean
Is this the cure for my aching bones?	modern
Perhaps you’ve learned from life and not from books.	modern
Oh my, Oh my!	modern
I pray thee, good Mercutio, let’s retire.	shakespearean
You have the best sorts of happiness to enjoy.	modern
What, shall I groan and tell thee?	shakespearean
Towards him I made, but he was 'ware of me And stole into the covert of the wood.	shakespearean
Thou know’st my daughter’s of a pretty age.	shakespearean
Nay, good goose, bite not.	shakespearean
How hast thou the heart, Being a divine, a ghostly confessor, A sin-absolver, and my friend professed, To mangle me with that word “banishèd”?	shakespearean
Why are you knocking so hard?	modern
Tell me if it’s good or bad, and I’ll wait for the details.	modern
For what, I pray thee?	shakespearean
I’ll to my rest.	shakespearean
Yes, I know her age down to the hour.	modern
This sight of death is as a bell, That warns my old age to a sepulcher.	shakespearean
Be honest and helpful, and I’ll repay you for your efforts.	modern
I carry no hatred, holy man, because my request will benefit my enemy.	modern
Or shall we on without apology?	shakespearean
Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a cat to scratch a man to death!	shakespearean
What is it else?	shakespearean
For himself to mar,” quoth he?	shakespearean
Sometimes she rides over a courtier’s lips, and he dreams of making money off of someone.	modern
Fear me not.	shakespearean
They lie in bed while they dream about the truth.	modern
Young man, something’s wrong if you’re getting out of bed this early.	modern
The hurt cannot be much.	shakespearean
Death, which has taken her away to make me cry, now ties up my tongue and won’t let me speak.	modern
If I can’t do it myself, I’ll find someone who can.	modern
Who’s ruining my rituals of true love?	modern
I’ll go call the watch.	modern
She’s talking, but she’s not saying anything.	modern
Is it good e'en?	shakespearean
The day is broke.	shakespearean
She is in a better place.	modern
Do as I tell you.	modern
Indeed, I never shall be satisfied With Romeo, till I behold him—dead— Is my poor heart for a kinsman vexed.	shakespearean
Is it good or bad?	modern
But come what sorrow can, It cannot countervail the exchange of joy That one short minute gives me in her sight.	shakespearean
Hide yourself, good Romeo.	modern
That might be the case sir,	modern
Draw thy tool!	shakespearean
I know all of this.	modern
Bear hence this body and attend our will.	shakespearean
When and where and how We met, we wooed and made exchange of vow, I’ll tell thee as we pass, but this I pray: That thou consent to marry us today.	shakespearean
I’m not myself.	modern
If I had seen something like that, I would have quickly pulled out my weapon.	modern
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites By their own beauties, or, if love be blind, It best agrees with night.	shakespearean
I drink to you.	modern
If I answered that question, I’d be making confession to you.	modern
Where is my husband?	modern
Give me some comfort, Nurse.	modern
They pray; grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.	shakespearean
I will go call the watch.	shakespearean
Romeo, will you come to your father’s?	shakespearean
They howl about banishment.	modern
My daughter is still very young.	modern
Then you were right on target.	modern
What wilt thou tell her, Nurse?	shakespearean
Well, do what you want.	modern
Had she affections and warm youthful blood, She would be as swift in motion as a ball.	shakespearean
And aren’t you a Montague?	modern
My back aches too—	modern
It’s not daylight.	modern
I bring thee tidings of the Prince’s doom.	shakespearean
Don’t reply.	modern
Brother, I’ll go and bring it thee.	shakespearean
Answer to that.	shakespearean
Leave me alone for a minute.	modern
Your looks are pale and wild, and do import Some misadventure.	shakespearean
And why, wise lady?	modern
What say you?	shakespearean
I’ll make you quiet.—What, cheerly, my hearts!	shakespearean
O flesh, flesh, you’ve turned pale and weak like a fish.	modern
I think He told me Paris should have married Juliet.	shakespearean
I’ll find Romeo To comfort you.	shakespearean
What says Romeo?	shakespearean
Why should you fall into so deep an O?	shakespearean
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.	shakespearean
Whether it’s even or odd, of all the days in the year, on the night of Lammas Eve, she’ll be fourteen.	modern
I don’t know, and he won’t tell me.	modern
If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine, Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline.	shakespearean
And you told me to bury my love.	modern
Come on, you’re being ridiculous!	modern
Let’s go!	modern
I mean, an we be in choler, we’ll draw.	shakespearean
That banishment is worse than the murder of ten thousand Tybalts.	modern
Thank you, dear Nurse.	modern
At my humble house tonight, you can expect to see dazzling stars that walk on the ground and light the sky from below.	modern
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.	shakespearean
What, are you busy, ho?	shakespearean
Then the dovehouse shook with the earthquake.	modern
No money, I swear.	modern
No better.	shakespearean
A beautiful target is the one that gets hit the fastest.	modern
Yes, boy, I’m ready.	modern
Not me, believe me.	modern
Tis almost morning.	shakespearean
The son and heir of old Tiberio.	shakespearean
You can’t talk about something that you don’t feel.	modern
Be happy that you’re alive.	modern
Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud, Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies, And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine, With repetition of “My Romeo!” It is my soul that calls upon my name.	shakespearean
I hope maybe then you’ll send him back home soon.	modern
Your servants were fighting your enemy’s servants before I got here.	modern
What’s this?	modern
Do as I bid thee, go.	shakespearean
Any man who knows how to write can answer a letter.	modern
O life!	shakespearean
If he hears you, you’ll make him angry.	modern
Be ruled by me.	shakespearean
By'r Lady, thirty years.	shakespearean
That’s very soon.	modern
His son was a minor only two years ago.	modern
Say either, and I’ll stay the circumstance.	shakespearean
Oh heavens!	modern
That braggart, punk villain who fights like he learned swordsmanship from a manual!	modern
My fan, Peter.	shakespearean
Oh God, I have a soul that predicts evil things!	modern
Twas no need, I trow, To bid me trudge.	shakespearean
For, I am sure, you have your hands full all In this so sudden business.	shakespearean
I will leave here for Verona tonight.	modern
It is “music with her silver sound” because musicians have no gold for sounding.	shakespearean
Why are you waiting?	modern
There is no world for me outside the walls of Verona, except purgatory, torture, and hell itself.	modern
Shall I believe That unsubstantial death is amorous, And that the lean abhorrèd monster keeps Thee here in dark to be his paramour?	shakespearean
Let’s talk.	shakespearean
He looks skinny, like a dried herring without its eggs, and he hasn’t got his girl.	modern
Don’t stand there shocked.	modern
Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.	shakespearean
Therefore stay yet.	shakespearean
But he has to make his speeches of love to a woman who’s supposed to be his enemy.	modern
Have you done everything you could to make him tell you the reason?	modern
I am for you.	shakespearean
But I can’t help laughing to think that the baby stopped crying and said, “Yes.” I swear, she had a bump on her forehead as big as a rooster’s testicle.	modern
Poison, I see, has been the cause of his death.	modern
Why would you do that, my love?	modern
Then I’ll smack you on the head with the serving-creature’s knife.	modern
You know how young my daughter is.	modern
Because it’s dark out, I’m afraid all this is just a dream, too sweet to be real.	modern
Alack the day!	shakespearean
How oft tonight Have my old feet stumbled at graves!—Who’s there?	shakespearean
If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.	shakespearean
O serpent heart hid with a flowering face!	shakespearean
You’re whiter than snow on the black wings of a raven.	modern
He’s not the most polite man in the world, but, believe me, he’s gentle as a lamb.	modern
Meantime forbear, And let mischance be slave to patience.— Bring forth the parties of suspicion.	shakespearean
Look, and you’ll see.	modern
Lady, come from that nest Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep.	shakespearean
Listen, she loved her cousin Tybalt dearly, and so did I.	modern
The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.	shakespearean
I’ll go alone.	modern
I’m done for in this world, I believe.	modern
I can’t believe that dog, that rat, that mouse, that cat could scratch me to death!	modern
The bridegroom is already here.	modern
You can’t get out of trouble by praying or crying, so don’t bother.	modern
Stay, Tybalt, stay!	shakespearean
And with another for tying the new shoes he made with old laces?	modern
I’m going to the Friar to find out his solution.	modern
Now heaven hath all,	shakespearean
Nurse, will you go with me into my closet To help me sort such needful ornaments As you think fit to furnish me tomorrow?	shakespearean
How, how, how, how?	shakespearean
Go, sirrah, trudge about Through fair Verona.	shakespearean
Capulet, you villain!	modern
If I were in the habit of fighting the way you are, my life insurance rates would be sky high.	modern
Yet I wish I could take that promise back, so I had it to give again.	modern
I won’t move to please anybody.	modern
And she’s fair I love.	shakespearean
I am the greatest, able to do least, Yet most suspected, as the time and place Doth make against me, of this direful murder.	shakespearean
Put it together with something else.	modern
Your cheeks are thin because of hunger.	modern
Everybody knows I’m a nice piece of flesh.	modern
Oh, what a sad day!	modern
Oh, he’s a lovely gentleman!	modern
An eagle, madam, Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye As Paris hath.	shakespearean
Muffle me, night, awhile.	shakespearean
Wherefore weep I then?	shakespearean
I don’t know, sir.	modern
Well get you gone.	shakespearean
Yes ,madam.	modern
Mercutio, thou consort’st with Romeo.	shakespearean
There’s still a stain on your cheek from an old tear that hasn’t been washed off yet.	modern
I do but keep the peace.	shakespearean
Oh, Juliet, I already know about your sad situation.	modern
You’ll find me ready enough to do that, sir, if you give me a reason.	modern
Help me into some house, Benvolio, Or I shall faint.	shakespearean
You look pale and wild as if you’re going to hurt yourself.	modern
Peace, you mumbling fool!	shakespearean
Hast thou not a word of joy?	shakespearean
There lies the man, slain by young Romeo, That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.	shakespearean
Don’t let the Nurse stay with you in your bedroom.	modern
Oh friendly friar!	modern
Romeo has been banished.” That news brings infinite death.	modern
Then isn’t it just the right dish for a sweet goose?	modern
Her body sleeps in Capels' monument, And her immortal part with angels lives.	shakespearean
Wish me luck.	modern
Father, what’s the news?	modern
The world affords no law to make thee rich.	shakespearean
As if that name, Shot from the deadly level of a gun, Did murder her, as that name’s cursed hand Murdered her kinsman.	shakespearean
Tybalt was my nephew!	modern
She’s not even fourteen years old.	modern
Art thou gone so, love, lord?	shakespearean
And so did I.	shakespearean
Now, fellow, what have you got there?	modern
Care keeps his watch in every old man’s eye, And where care lodges, sleep will never lie.	shakespearean
Find out the way, and I’ll find the right man.	modern
Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir.	shakespearean
Tomorrow will I send.	shakespearean
And to sink in it, should you burthen love— Too great oppression for a tender thing.	shakespearean
Let me see her.	modern
Give me the letter.	modern
Oh, holy Friar, Oh, tell me, holy Friar, where is my lady’s husband?	modern
Any man that can write may answer a letter.	shakespearean
Either thou or I, or both, must go with him.	shakespearean
Men’s eyes were made to see things, so let them watch.	modern
I have news for you about the Prince’s punishment.	modern
You’re like one of those guys who walks into a bar, slams his sword on the table, and then says, “I pray I never have to use you.” By the time he orders his second drink, he pulls his sword on the bartender for no reason at all.	modern
What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?	shakespearean
But I’ll amerce you with so strong a fine That you shall all repent the loss of mine.	shakespearean
Tybalt is dead, and Romeo banishèd.”	shakespearean
A gentleman, Nurse, that loves to hear himself talk, and will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.	shakespearean
Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.	shakespearean
I’ll go to him.	modern
Are you going to join them?	modern
My child, my reason for living, wake up, look up, or I’ll die with you!	modern
O cousin, cousin!	shakespearean
Now, by Saint Peter’s Church and Peter too, He shall not make me there a joyful bride.	shakespearean
Hold the friar too.	modern
Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn, The gallant, young, and noble gentleman, The County Paris, at Saint Peter’s Church, Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.	shakespearean
Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.	shakespearean
Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.— O churl, drunk all, and left no friendly drop To help me after?	shakespearean
Oh, do you think we’ll ever meet again?	modern
His son was but a ward two years ago.	shakespearean
Leave me and do what I told you to do.	modern
Comfort me.	shakespearean
My dream told me that dreamers often lie.	modern
Your husband lies dead there, and Paris too.	modern
You’ll be sick tomorrow For this night’s watching.	shakespearean
Supper is done, and we shall come too late.	shakespearean
But where have you been?	modern
Yes, a thousand times.	modern
No, it’s not as deep as a well, or as wide as a church door, but it’s enough.	modern
Isn’t that what he said?	modern
Can’t you find a reason without my giving you one?	modern
Oh Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio is dead!	modern
Tybalt, old Capulet’s nephew, has sent a letter to Romeo’s father’s house.	modern
Hence will I to my ghostly friar’s close cell, His help to crave and my dear hap to tell.	shakespearean
Seigneur Valentio and his cousin Tybalt; Lucio and the lively Helena.” A fair assembly.	shakespearean
Death has sucked the honey from your breath, but it has not yet ruined your beauty.	modern
Give me thy torch, boy.	shakespearean
Seigneur Martino and his wife and daughters; County Anselme and his beauteous sisters; The lady widow of Vitruvio; Seigneur Placentio and his lovely nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; Mine uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters; My fair niece Rosaline and Livia;	shakespearean
Is the worst well?	modern
I spoke with his man.	shakespearean
Will you pull your sword out of its sheath?	modern
Good and noble young man, don’t mess with someone who’s desperate.	modern
In the meantime I wrote to Romeo and told him to come here on this awful night to help remove her from her temporary grave when the sleeping potion wore off.	modern
I will.	modern
These times of woe afford no time to woo.	shakespearean
Hie, make haste, Make haste.	shakespearean
Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.	shakespearean
I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.	shakespearean
Ask for me tomorrow, and you shall find me a grave man.	shakespearean
But if you have to swear, swear by your wonderful self, which is the god I worship like an idol, and then I’ll believe you.	modern
Our wedding banquet will become a sad burial feast.	modern
News from Verona!—How now, Balthasar?	shakespearean
Don’t think about her.	modern
I would forget it fain, But oh, it presses to my memory, Like damnèd guilty deeds to sinners' minds.	shakespearean
I strike quickly, being moved.	shakespearean
Never was seen so black a day as this.	shakespearean
Please be quiet.	modern
Don’t tell me that you’ve heard about this marriage, Friar, unless you can tell me how to prevent it.	modern
Famine is in thy cheeks.	shakespearean
Have you delivered to her our decree?	shakespearean
It’s not true because she separates us.	modern
It’s some meteor coming out of the sun to light your way to Mantua.	modern
She’s not well married that lives married long, But she’s best married that dies married young.	shakespearean
He struck me from under your arm.	modern
Some comfort, Nurse.	shakespearean
If he’s been killed, say “Yes.” If not, say “No.” These short words will determine my joy or my pain.	modern
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?	shakespearean
I bear no hatred, blessèd man, for, lo, My intercession likewise steads my foe.	shakespearean
This is a pitiful sight!	modern
Oh great, here come the Capulets.	modern
Oh, noise?	modern
Who are you?	modern
Before and apace.	shakespearean
What does my hidden wife say about our ruined love?	modern
I’m a man, my lady, that God has made for himself to ruin.	modern
I’ll to the friar to know his remedy.	shakespearean
Parting is such sweet sorrow that I’ll say good night until tonight becomes tomorrow.	modern
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed.	shakespearean
We’re bound to each other in every possible way, except we need you to marry us.	modern
Peace, ho, for shame!	shakespearean
Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?	shakespearean
That “may be” must be, love, on Thursday.	modern
Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous— Where is your mother?	shakespearean
He ran this way and leapt this orchard wall.	shakespearean
And from her womb children of divers kind We sucking on her natural bosom find, Many for many virtues excellent, None but for some and yet all different.	shakespearean
Nay, that’s not so.	shakespearean
We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.— Is it e'en so?	shakespearean
Who’s the one who’s going out the door right now?	modern
You kiss by th' book.	shakespearean
Oh, so madmen like you are also deaf.	modern
Methinks I see my cousin’s ghost Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body Upon a rapier’s point.	shakespearean
Goodbye, cousin.	modern
Where I have learned me to repent the sin Of disobedient opposition To you and your behests, and am enjoined By holy Lawrence to fall prostrate here To beg your pardon.	shakespearean
It’s been eleven years since the earthquake.	modern
I scolded you for obsessing about her, not for loving her, my student.	modern
We’ll keep no great ado, a friend or two.	shakespearean
You say you don’t know what the girl thinks.	modern
Thou fond mad man, hear me a little speak.	shakespearean
Who is her mother?	modern
Both our remedies Within thy help and holy physic lies.	shakespearean
I would I were thy bird.	shakespearean
You were the prettiest baby I ever nursed.	modern
Prates too.—What say you, James Soundpost?	shakespearean
Get up, man!	modern
But he’s not better than mine.	modern
But I will write again to Mantua, And keep her at my cell till Romeo come.	shakespearean
In the beautiful city of Verona, where our story takes place, a long-standing hatred between two families erupts into new violence, and citizens stain their hands with the blood of their fellow citizens.	modern
Not life, but love in death.	shakespearean
So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend Which you weep for.	shakespearean
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug, Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall.	shakespearean
Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.	shakespearean
Come, come with me, and we will make short work.	shakespearean
This calm submission is dishonorable and vile.	modern
Shake!” quoth the dovehouse.	shakespearean
But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?	shakespearean
It’s only just now nine o'clock.	modern
Tis all one.	shakespearean
Don’t talk to me, because I won’t say a word.	modern
Oh painful sympathy!	modern
Your love will use it to climb up to your window while it’s dark.	modern
But why, you villain, did you kill my cousin?	modern
Come you to make confession to this Father?	shakespearean
A madness most discreet, A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.	shakespearean
Yes, madam, he lies beyond my reach.	modern
Welcome back from Mantua.	modern
Doth not  Ay, Nurse, what of that?	shakespearean
I am peppered, I warrant, for this world.	shakespearean
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel When well-appareled April on the heel Of limping winter treads.	shakespearean
I’ll to him.	shakespearean
It is written, that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last, the fisher with his pencil and the painter with his nets.	shakespearean
Yes, she will.	modern
How sweet is love itself possessed When but love’s shadows are so rich in joy!	shakespearean
Or did I dream it so?	shakespearean
In the meantime, hold on, and be patient.	modern
The sweeter rest was mine.	shakespearean
You’ll  Enough of this.	modern
That’s really news!	modern
It is the lark that sings so out of tune, Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.	shakespearean
Make haste, lest mine be about your ears ere it be out.	shakespearean
How canst thou try them so?	shakespearean
Then I rebel against you, stars!	modern
But I’m wishing for something I already have.	modern
I dare not, sir.	shakespearean
Yes she has, and by keeping celibate, she wastes her beauty.	modern
What, are you hurt?	modern
Well, start thinking about marriage now.	modern
A plague o' both your houses!	shakespearean
Stay here for a moment.	modern
Maybe she can’t find him.	modern
Or was I dreaming?	modern
Your head is as full of fights as an egg is full of yolk, but your head has been beaten like scrambled eggs from so much fighting.	modern
I hope you sleep peacefully.	modern
What does Romeo say?	modern
Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man.	shakespearean
Tis but thy name that is my enemy.	shakespearean
Everything’s out of control.	modern
What, drawn, and talk of peace?	shakespearean
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay To hear true shrift.—Come, madam, let’s away.	shakespearean
If I do so, it will mean more if I say it behind your back than if I say it to your face.	modern
That knife should be in its sheath on that Montague’s back, but instead it’s mis-sheathed in my daughter’s breast.	modern
Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.	shakespearean
Yes, alright, go, I say, and bring him here.	modern
An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.	shakespearean
We waste our lights in vain, like lights by day.	shakespearean
Either you, or I, or both of us have to go with him.	modern
If I live to see you get married someday, all my wishes will come true.	modern
You wouldn’t tell a sick man he “seriously” has to make his will—it would just make him worse.	modern
I am none of his flirt-gills.	shakespearean
Well, you have made a simple choice.	shakespearean
Don’t deny to him that you love me.	modern
My words would bandy her to my sweet love, And his to me.	shakespearean
Blind is his love and best befits the dark.	shakespearean
Do you like this haste?	shakespearean
And yet no further than a wanton’s bird, That lets it hop a little from his hand Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves, And with a silken thread plucks it back again, So loving-jealous of his liberty.	shakespearean
I will not fail.	shakespearean
Oh, rude and unthankful boy!	modern
Saint Francis, help me!	modern
I’ll punish you so harshly that you’ll regret causing me this loss.	modern
You’re an insolent little boy.	modern
Alright, I will.	modern
Then hurry up and rush over to Friar Lawrence’s cell.	modern
I thought it was the right thing to do.	modern
She’s been dead for some time.	modern
O me!	shakespearean
But, I’ll warrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as any clout in the versal world.	shakespearean
Wherefore storm you so?	shakespearean
Take it in what sense thou wilt.	shakespearean
You kiss like you’ve studied how.	modern
So that my speed to Mantua there was stayed.	shakespearean
Romeo killed Tybalt.	modern
I’ll to dinner.	shakespearean
That sound you heard was the  It was the lark, the bird that sings at dawn, not the nightingale.	modern
I will carry no crotchets.	shakespearean
This doth not so, for she divideth us.	shakespearean
Your answer is so strange!	modern
Oh,” he said, “Did you fall on your face?	modern
The date is out of such prolixity.	shakespearean
Come between us, good Benvolio.	shakespearean
Be trusty, and I’ll quit thy pains.	shakespearean
Listen, your Romeo will be here tonight.	modern
Have at thee, coward!	shakespearean
Tybalt’s death would be bad enough if that was all.	modern
And yet you say that exile is not death?	modern
I stand on sudden haste.	shakespearean
I’ll be with you right away.	modern
Madam, an eagle does not have eyes as green, as quick, and as fair as the eyes of Paris.	modern
So did I.	modern
Why, what is Tybalt?	shakespearean
All this is comfort.	shakespearean
Good morning, cousin.	modern
Not to his father’s house.	modern
Well, what was your dream?	modern
My master’s.	shakespearean
How well my comfort is revived by this!	shakespearean
Then who took my letter to Romeo?	modern
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?	shakespearean
I will hence tonight.	shakespearean
I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.	shakespearean
The cure for confusion is not yelling and screaming.	modern
Said he not so?	shakespearean
What are you going to tell her, Nurse?	modern
But no more deep will I endart mine eye Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.	shakespearean
Ay, those attires are best.	shakespearean
Look at other beautiful girls.	modern
I pay you because you’re poor, not because you want me to buy this.	modern
No words can express the pain.	modern
Lord, Lord, when she was a little baby—Oh, there is one nobleman in the city, a guy named Paris, who would be happy to claim her as his own.	modern
I sent the Nurse at nine o'clock.	modern
Will you speak well of him that killed your cousin?	shakespearean
At this same ancient feast of Capulet’s Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so loves With all the admired beauties of Verona.	shakespearean
Tybalt was my dearest cousin.	modern
I do beseech you, sir, have patience.	shakespearean
Did you have no poison, no sharp knife, no weapon you could use to kill me quickly, nothing so disgraceful, except banishment?	modern
I’ll never be satisfied with Romeo until I see him .	modern
It’s someone with a torch!	modern
Oh my!	modern
A dog from that house will make me angry enough to take a stand.	modern
Believe me, I’ll draw my sword as quick as any other man if I see a fight starting and the law is on my side.	modern
How is she?	modern
O Romeo, Romeo!	shakespearean
