# Formality Data
The formality data is sourced from the Grammarly's Yahoo Answers Formality Corpus (GYAFC). Due to the license issue, we only provide the preprocessing scripts for GYFAC in `processing_gyafc.py`. 


In order to download the GYFAC dataset, please follow the instructions <a href="https://github.com/raosudha89/GYAFC-corpus">here</a>. 

After downloading the GYFAC dataset to this folder, run `processing_gyafc.py` to get `train.tsv`, `dev.tsv`, `test.tsv`.
